Ord. 2010-020, passed 7-20-2010)\n\u00a7 152.090 ABANDONMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF A NONCONFORMITY.\n(A) When a nonconforming use is (1) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (2) discontinued for any\nperiod of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use (maintaining minimum services, water, sewer,\nelectricity), the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes, except as provided in division (B) of\nthis section.\n(B) The Board of Commissioners may issue a special use permit to allow a nonconforming use that has been\ndiscontinued for more than 180 consecutive days to be reinstated if it finds that (1) the nonconforming use has been\ndiscontinued for less than two years, and (2) the discontinuance resulted from factors that, for all practical purposes, were\nbeyond the control of the person maintaining the nonconforming use\n(C) If the principal activity on property where a nonconformity other than a nonconforming use exists is (1) discontinued\nfor a consecutive period of 180 days, or (2) discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that\nactivity (maintaining minimum services, water, sewer, electricity), then that property may thereafter be used only in\nconformity with all of the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located, unless the Board of\nCommissioners issues a special use permit to allow the property to be used (for a conforming purpose) without correcting\nthe nonconforming situation. The Board shall issue such a permit if it finds that (1) the nonconforming situation cannot be\ncorrected without undue hardship or expense, and (2) the nonconforming situation is of a minor nature that does not\nadversely affect the surrounding property or the general public to any significant extent.\n(D) For purposes of determining whether a right to continue anonconformity is lost pursuant to this subsection, all of the\nbuildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure\nto rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home park for\n180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or\nmanufactured home park as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction\nwith a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain\nit\nthereafter. And so, if a manufactured home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming\nresidential structure also is located, removal of that manufactured home for 180 days terminates the right to replace it.\n(E) When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of\nthis chapter, the 180-day period for purposes of this subsection begins to run at the effective date of this chapter unless\nservices are maintained (water, sewer, electricity).\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005) (Am.

Thereafter, work on nonconforming projects may\nbegin, or may be continued, only pursuant to a special use permit issued by the Board of Commissioners (except as\nprovided in division (B) of this section). The Board shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith\nmade substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some\nsubstantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this chapter and thereby\nwould be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed. In considering whether these findings\nmay be made, the Board shall be guided by the following:\n(1) All expenditures made pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building or zoning permit shall be considered as\nevidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this chapter became effective;\n(2) Except as provided in division (A)(1) of this section, no expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective\ndate of this chapter shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this\nchapter became effective. An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure;\n(3) To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced\nby having made those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made expenditure to\nacquire a potential development site if the property obtained is just as valuable under the new classification as it was under\nthe old, or the expenditure can be recovered by resale of the property;\n(4) An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of (a) the total\nestimated cost of the proposed project, and (b) the ordinary business practices of the developer\n(5) A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use\nlaw affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him or her; and\n(6) Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site,\nthe Board may still find that he acted in good faith if he or she did not proceed with his or her plans in a deliberate attempt to\ncircumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance.

Conditional Zoning Districts\n(1) Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is subject to site-\nspecific conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the zoning district.\n(2) A conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards and\nconditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have\nsignificant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community. There are also circumstances in\nwhich a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even\nthough the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these\nregulations, the adopted land use plan, adopted area plans and other long range plans. The review process established in\nthis division provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district\nsubject to specific conditions which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties.\nA\nconditional zoning district is generally not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal, except when that proposal is\nconsistent with an approved district or area plan or the proposal can demonstrate that public infrastructure needed to serve\nthe development will be made available within a reasonable time period. A separate master plan approval process as\ndescribed in this division may be utilized only when a proposal is a component of a development project that is the subject of\na development agreement between Town of Swansboro and a developer pursuant to G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 160D-1001 through 160D-\n1012.\n"}, {"page": "58", "text": "Single family\nMulti-story hotel\n24- West Corbett Avenue\nExisting grocery store\nFigure 10-11.1\nParcel Suitable for Conditional Zoning\nFigure 152.180.1 (Sample parcel suitable for Conditional Zoning)\n(a) Flexible lot development requires rezoning to Conditional Zoning Districts (CZ).\n1. Flexible lot development is an area of land under unified control, to be developed as a single entity for a number\nand variety of dwelling and/or commercial units, according to a Master Plan which is approved at the time of the rezoning.\n2. Flexible lot development developments such as mixed use requested within traditional commercial zoning\ndistricts such as B1, B2 and B3 shall incorporate a minimum of 25% of the total project area to commercial buildings or\nservices. The development of neighborhood, community or regional commercial centers shall be in scale with surrounding\nmarket areas at locations recommended herein or the town's Land Use Plan. The development is intended to permit the\nestablishment of the projects only where planned centers with carefully organized buildings, service areas, parking areas\nand landscaped open spaces will clearly serve demonstrated public need, reduce marginal traffic friction that would result\nfrom strip commercial development along highways, and protect property values in surrounding neighborhoods.\n3. Flexible lot development is intended to allow flexibility (variety) in development and encourage the use of\ninnovative design and layout that would not otherwise be permitted under the UDO because of strict application of the\nzoning district or general development standards. Flexible lot development encourages innovative land planning and design\nconcepts by:\na. Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and\ndevelopment standards (e.g. height, setbacks lot width that were designed primarily for individual lots\nb. Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space and design amenities;\nC. Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the same development including mix of housing\ntypes, housing prices, lot sizes, densities and non-residential uses;\nd. Promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing development to take\nadvantage of special site characteristics, locations and land uses; and\ne. Encouraging quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing increases in base\ndensities when the increases can be justified by superior design or the provision of additional amenities such as public\nand/or private open space\n4. In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements, flexible lot developments are expected to: deliver\nexceptional quality community designs that preserve critical environmental resources; provide above- average open space\namenities, incorporate creative design in the layout of buildings, open and circulation; coordinate and unify design elements\nof the project, including building materials, signage and architectural compatibility; assure compatibility with surrounding land\nuses and neighborhood character; and provide greater efficiency in the layout and provision of roads, utilities and other\ninfrastructure. The Conditional Zoning District process shall not be used as a means of circumventing the town's adopted\nzoning and development regulations for routine developments\n5. Uses allowed. Flexible lot development may contain any or all of the uses specified in the approved Master Plan,\nprovided the uses are consistent with the town's Land Use Plan. A wide range of uses is possible in flexible lot development\n,\nand the specific uses allowed may be different in each development approved through the Conditional Zoning District\nprocess. All uses that are set out in an approved Master Plan shall be treated as permitted uses within the development,\nexcept that uses which are prohibited shall not be permitted within the development.\n6.

Mixed use development may occur by having retail or commercial\nuses located in the same building (e.g., retail or office space on ground floor and residential above) or by having non-\nresidential uses located in different buildings sited on the same lot or parcel (e.g., office building located on the same parcel\nas a freestanding residential structure\nb. Mixed use developments shall be designed, located and oriented on the site so that non-residential uses are\ndirectly accessible to residents of the development For the purposes of this section, directly accessible shall mean\npedestrian and vehicular access by way of improved sidewalks, paths, greenways and streets that do not involve leaving the\ndevelopment or using a major thoroughfare Directly accessible does not necessarily mean that non-residential uses need to\nbe located in a particular location, but that the siting of the uses considers the accessibility of the residential component of\nthe development to the non-residential use.\n7. Flexible lot development approved through a Conditional Zoning District shall be subject to all applicable overlay\ndistrict regulations, all applicable environmental regulations, and all applicable general regulations, unless otherwise waived\nor modified by the town in the terms of the approved master plan. In case of any conflict between a specific regulation set\nforth in this chapter and the UDO and town code of ordinances, the regulation in this section shall apply unless otherwise\nexpressly allowed.\n8.

All overlay district requirements and standards;\nb. Ownership requirements for any open space buffers or streetscapes unless otherwise permitted in the UDO;\nStormwater control and erosion and sedimentation control requirements;\n9. Other applicable standards (minimum).\na. Emergency access. Any building established as part of a flexible lot development which cannot properly be\nserved by emergency or service vehicles from an abutting street shall be made accessible to the vehicles by a paved\ndriveway having a roadbed width of not less than 20 feet, exclusive of parking spaces.\nb.\nTransportation and circulation system. The development's Master Plan shall demonstrate a logical, adequate,\nsafe and convenient on- site transportation system that addresses vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian and transit circulation that\nconnects all residential areas with pedestrian destinations on and off-site, such as schools , churches, shopping areas and\nrecreational areas. All elements of the on-site transportation system shall be integrated with all off-site transportation\ncirculation systems, with particular attention to minimizing pedestrian/automobile contact.\nC. Off-street parking and loading. The development's Master Plan shall comply with the off-street parking and\nloading requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 152.290 through 152.296, except that variations from these standards may be permitted if a\ncomprehensive parking and loading plan for the development is submitted as part of the Master Plan that is suitable for the\ndevelopment and consistent with the intent and purpose of the offstreet parking and loading standards of the UDO.\nd. Landscaping. Landscaping shall comply with the standards of \u00a7$152.525 through 152.544, except that\nvariations from these standards may be permitted where it is demonstrated that the proposed landscaping sufficiently buffers\nuses from each other, ensures compatibility with land uses on surrounding properties, creates attractive streetscapes and\nparking areas and is consistent with the urban design objectives and/or character of the area.\ne. Utilities. Flexible lot development projects shall provide for underground installation of utilities, including\ntelephone and power in both public and private rights-of-way except when conditions not reasonably within the control of\nthe developer make this requirement unpractical.\nf. Areas to be preserved. In all flexible lot development projects, efforts shall be made to preserve historic sites,\nscenic points, large trees and other desirable natural growths, watercourses and other water areas, and other features\nworthy of preservation, either as portions of public sites and open spaces, or in the other form as to provide amenities to the\nneighborhood. Trees or other desirable natural growth located in public or private rights-of-way or public or private\neasements shall not be removed unless the removal is necessary for the installation of utilities or drainage structures or for\nother purposes in the public interest. The removal may be prohibited if the amenity of adjacent property, or the amenity of\nthe general neighborhood, is adversely affected.\ng. Building form.

Consideration for height modification shall be reviewed using the techniques as provided in (A)(2)\n(b)9.ii. through iv below. In no case shall the mean height exceed 40 feet.\ni. Stepback. Stepbacks can provide mitigation to views along the corridor by providing relief of the vertical mass.\nStepbacks provide a vertical transition between adjacent properties visually reducing the perceived scale of a building in\ncomparison to its surrounding context. An additional building setback of one foot for every requested one foot of height shall\nbe required above the town's 35 foot requirement.

The standards contained in this section are\nminimum standards and should not be regarded as optimum standards. The prudent property owner will generally provided\nconsiderably more off-street parking and loading spaces than these minimum requirements. These parking and loading\nstandards shall be enforced within the Historical District only to that extent considered feasible by the Board of Adjustment\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005)\n\u00a7 152.291 GENERAL.\n(A) Off-street parking requirements. There shall be provided at the time of the erection of anybuilding , or at the time any\nprincipal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by addingdwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor area; or before\nconversion from one type of uses or occupancy to another, permanent off-street parking space in the amount specified by\nthis chapter. Such parking space may be provided in a parking garage or properly graded open space. No off-street parking\nor loading shall be permitted in the required parkway area. See \u00a7 152.196(G).\n(B) Minimum parking requirement.\n(1)\nEach application for a building permit shall include information as to the location and dimensions of off-street\nparking and loading space and the means of ingress and egress to such space. Required off-street parking area for three\nor more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked, and shall be so designed, maintained, and regulated that no\nparking or maneuvering incidental to parking shall be on any public street, walk, or alley , unless the speed limit on the\npublic street walk, or alley is no greater than 20 miles per hour. Automobiles must be parked and unparked without moving\nanother. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the Administrator to determine whether or not the\nrequirements of this chapter are met.\n(2) The following diagrams depict the minimum dimensional requirements of off-street parking areas Parking space\nand aisle dimensions are required minimums.

Should the\nprojected build (off-season or seasonal) level of service for any signalized intersection or unsignalized intersection\nmovement in an urban area defined in division (G) fall below LOS \"D\" for a 60-minute peak hour, that intersection shall\ndeemed deficient. Should the projected build level of service for any signalized intersection or unsignalized intersection\nmovement in a rural area as defined in division (G) fall below LOS \"C\" for a 60-minute peak hour, that intersection shall be\ndeemed deficient. Should the build delay at an intersection or intersection approach increase by 25% or more (above and\nbeyond the existing background delay), that intersection approach shall be deemed deficient.\n(2) Should an intersection and/or intersection movement be deemed deficient (as outlined in division (F)(1)), the traffic\nimpact study shall provide potential capacity mitigation recommendations to allow the intersection or intersection approach\nto operate at a LOS \"D\" (in urban areas) or LOS \"C\" (in rural areas). Potential capacity mitigation recommendations include,\nbut are not limited to: modifications to internal circulation design; modifications to site access location and/or design;\nexternal roadway widening; external intersection modification (turn lane construction and the like); intersection signalization;\nand/or upgrades to network signal timings. All recommended improvement shall be designed by a North Carolina Licensed\nProfessional Engineer and provided to the town for review, comment, and approval. All recommended improvements to state\nmaintained facilities are subject to NCDOT approval. When connecting site driveways to state maintained facilities, the\napplicant must follow all NCDOT guidelines to acquire a driveway permit.\n(3) If it is determined by the town or the town's Traffic Engineer that the proposed development is only partially\nresponsible for a deficient intersection, intersection movement, or intersection approach, payment of a partial fee-in-lieu may\nbe considered. In this instance, the development shall be responsible for their proportionate share of a required\nimprovement A proportionate share is the percentage of a development's trips (as compared to the total volume of trips) at\nan intersection or intersection approach during the worst analyzed peak hour, all as determined by the town or the town's\nTraffic Engineer. For example, if a development's trips represent 5% of the total traffic at an intersection during the worst\nanalyzed peak hour, that development will be responsible for 5% of the total cost of the required improvement at that\nintersection. Any fee-in-lieu consideration will be at the sole discretion of the town or town's Traffic Engineer. The standards\nestablished in \u00a7 152.384 shall be followed.\n(G) Urban and rural intersections.

TND standards for streets and sidewalks are limited to\nsubdivisions having a minimum of 40 acres and a maximum of 125 acres.\n(2) A Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) is a human scale, walkable community with moderate to high\nresidential densities and a mixed use core. Compared with conventional suburban developments TNDs have a higher\npotential to increase modal split by encouraging and accommodating alternate transportation modes. TNDs also have a\nhigher potential for capturing internal trips, thus reducing vehicles miles traveled.\n(3) A dense network of narrow streets with reduced curb radii is fundamental to TND design. This network serves to\nboth slow and disperse vehicular traffic and provide a pedestrian friendly atmosphere. Such alternate guidelines are\nencouraged by NCDOT when the overall design ensures that non-vehicular travel is to be afforded every practical\naccommodation that does not adversely affect safety considerations. The overall function, comfort, and safety of a multi-\npurpose or \"shared\" street are more important than its vehicular efficiency alone.\n(4) TNDS have a high proportion of interconnected streets sidewalks, and paths. Streets and rights-of-ways are\nshared between vehicles (moving and parked), bicycles, and pedestrians. The dense network of TND streets functions in an\ninterdependent manner, providing continuous routes that enhance non-vehicular travel. Most TND streets are designed to\nminimize through traffic by the design of the street and the location of land uses. Streets are designed to only be as wide as\nneeded to accommodate the usual vehicular mix for that street while providing adequate access for moving vans, garbage\ntrucks, fire engines, and school buses.\n(5) As part of the NCDOT design criteria, there must be a discernable community center or core area. The proposed\ndevelopment must have a mixture of residential and non-residential land uses, with at least 10% of the developed area\nconsisting of non-residential uses. Most non-residential uses are located within the community core area. Within the core\narea, a minimum of 15% of floor area must be devoted to commercial uses oriented towards TND residents. Elementary\nschools are an important community element. Public structures, such as schools churches and civic buildings, and public\nopen spaces such as squares, parks playgrounds, and greenways, shall be integrated into neighborhood pattern.\n(S) Street inspection. Work performed pursuant to approved street construction plans shall be inspected and approved by\neither the town or the NCDOT, as applicable.\n(T) Street lights.

Major building design features, such as windows, doors, leaves, and\nparapets , shall be designed to be in proportion to one another.\n(C) Structural lines retained at storefront level. The structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the\nstorefront level. For instance, brick piers and columns shall be carried down to street level.\n(D) Awnings and canopies. Awnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of thebuilding to which they\nare affixed.\n(E) Massing. A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass should\nbe broken up through the use of setbacks projecting and recessed elements, andsimilar design techniques.

New buildings should respect the\nscale, and proportion of existing development.\n(A) Building color shades. Building color shades shall be used to facilitate blending into the neighborhood and unify the\ndevelopment The color shades of building materials shall draw from the range of color shades that already exist on the\nblock or it the adjacent neighborhood.\n(B) Building materials. Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood\nor, if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural\ndetailing, color, and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite\nthe differences in materials.\n(C) Similar size and height for infill development New infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if\nlarger, be articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and scale of other structures on the same\nblock, or if buildings do not exist thereon, then on adjoining blocks.\n(D) Unify individual storefronts. If several storefronts are located in one building the individual storefronts shall be unified\nin all exterior design elements, such as mass, window and door placement, color, materials, and signage.\n(E) Additions and renovations. Building additions and fa\u00e7ade renovations should be designed to reflect existing buildings\nin scale. A change in scale may require a transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings\n(F) Varying architectural styles. In developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be\ncompatible by such means as a pattern of architectural features, similar scale and proportions, and consistent location of\nsignage.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005)\n\u00a7 152.560 ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER.\nArchitectural character focuses on the specific details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular\ndevelopment.

A COA is required for any type of building exterior alteration, new construction, relocation, demolition,\nutility installation, placement of vending machines and other street furniture in public areas, dock installation, and substantial\nlandscaping. No COA is required for interior modifications or the ordinary maintenance or replacement \"in-kind\" of a property\nfeature. Replacement \"in-kind\" refers to the replacement of damaged or deteriorated building or site features with the same\ndesign and material so that the integrity of the original design is maintained.\nUpon consideration of exterior work, contact the Administrator at (910) 326-4428 to determine if a COA is required.\nApplications for a COA may be obtained from the\nbetween\nand\nMonday through\nFriday. Contact the Administrator for assistance with the application process.\n1.2 Completing and Filing the COA Application\nAfter obtaining a certificate of appropriateness application form from the Town of Swansboro, it is important that the form\nbe filled out completely. Proposed changes should be clearly explained in a narrative scope of work and presented in\nsufficient detail with accompanying photographs, drawings, and materials lists. These application components are important\nin helping the commission evaluate the proposal request promptly. Once the COA application has been completed, it, along\nwith the supporting materials, must be returned to the town Administrator not less than 14 working days prior to the regularly\nscheduled meeting of the Swansboro Historic Preservation Commission (SHPC). A fee to cover administrative and legal\nnotification costs is charged to all applicants. This fee must be paid at the time of application submission.\n1.3 COA Application Review and Processing\nOnce a completed COA application has been received by the town, it is reviewed by the Administrator for compliance with\nall applicable town zoning ordinances and codes. Applications that are not in compliance with zoning and other town code\nprovisions will be returned to the applicant and will not be forwarded to the commission for review. Applicants should note\nthat additional permits may be required (e.g., building permit, CAMA permit, or Army Corps of Engineers approval). Early\nconsultation with applicable permit agencies is advisable so that the impact of requirements on the COA proposal may be\nassessed. The commission may choose to delay consideration of an application to consult with applicable federal, state, or\nlocal agencies. This is particularly important when the North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office (NC-SHOO) is\nasked to review and comment on the project as part of a required environmental review process.\n"}, {"page": "204", "text": "Upon completion of local zoning and code review, the Administrator will forward the applications to the SHPC for review\nand action. Notification of the meeting date, time, and place will be sent to the applicant and adjoining property owners by\nmail no less than seven (7) working days prior to the meeting. Attendance at the meeting by the applicant or his/her\nrepresentative is required should any questions or concerns regarding the project arise. The failure of the applicant or the\napplicant's representative to attend a meeting may result in unnecessary delay if the SHPC fails to obtain information\ndeemed necessary to make an informed decision. Any interested party is also welcome to attend the meeting or to review\nthe application at town hall prior to the SHPC hearing.\nMost certificate of appropriateness applications are reviewed and decided upon the day of the meeting. The commission\nmust issue or deny a COA within 60 days after a completed application has been filed, except when the time limit has been\nextended by mutual agreement between the applicant and the historic preservation commission or more time is needed to\nobtain comments from other federal, state, or local agencies involved in the permitting, funding, or approval of the project.\nAll commission decisions are furnished in writing and mailed to the applicant within 30 days of the meeting. There will be two\nidentical certificates mailed - one for posting and one for records. The mailed Certificate of Appropriateness must be visibly\ndisplayed at the project site during the entire duration of the project.\nOnce issued, a Certificate of Appropriateness is valid for six months and may be renewed at the written request of the\napplicant. An approved COA may also be transferred to a new property owner if that owner certifies in writing that he has\nreviewed the approved application and agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the COA.\nAn approved or pending COA application may be modified by a written request from the applicant to the commission. The\nrequest should include a description of the proposed changes, as well as drawings, a site plan, and other appropriate\ndocumentation if necessary. If the Swansboro Historic Preservation Commission finds that the modifications constitute a\nsubstantial change from the previous application, a new application submission will be required and all public notification\nprocedures will be followed.\n1.4 Treatment of \"Minor Works\" Projects\nIn an effort to expedite the review of Certificate of Appropriateness applications, the Swansboro Historic Preservation\nCommission recognizes that certain proposed building and/or site changes are minor in nature and will have no discernible\nimpact on the special character of the building, site, and district. Given this, the SHPC has instituted a category of exterior\nactivities known as \"minor works\" that may be undertaken without review by the commission. These projects must be\nconsistent with the SHPC's standards and approved by the Minor Works Committee. \"Minor works\" activities do require the\nsubmission of a completed Minor Works COA application form. (Note: The town does not provide notice to adjoining\nproperty owners for a \"minor works\" submission.)\nThe following is a list of exterior work items that fall under the \"minor work\" category:\n-Installation of \"full-view\" storm or louver wooden storm doors or \"full-view\" metal storm doors with baked-on paint finish;\n-Installation of metal storm windows with baked on paint finish and horizontal dividers that are in alignment with the\nhorizontal meeting rails of the original upper and lower sashes;\n-Installation of half-round gutters and downspouts made of copper or with painted finish;\n-Fence installation in rear yards or other areas not visible from the public view;\n-Installation of window air conditioning units, window fans, and TV antennas\n-Installation of skylights and solar collectors in areas not visible from public view;\n-Installation of HVAC units and other mechanical equipment in areas not visible from public view;\n-Removal of existing incongruous synthetic siding if original siding exists underneath; and\n-Installation of private walkways or back yard patio areas (decks not included).\nNote: The Minor Works Committee shall forward a \"minor works\" item to the SHPC for full review if the activity does not\nfall directly into one of the above categories or is inconsistent with the commission's established standards.\n1.5 Pre-Application Review of Projects\nProperty owners considering projects in the Swansboro historic district are encouraged to take advantage of free technical\nadvice and design assistance provided by the SHPC prior to the submission of a Certificate of Appropriateness application.\nThis pre-review, usually held with a preappointed subcommittee of the commission during the regularly scheduled work\nsession, may help expedite the review process because it familiarizes the applicant in the early stages of project\ndevelopment with the applicable standards that will be used to evaluate the project proposal. It also gives commissioners an\nopportunity to discuss the project concept informally and identify issues that may be of concern. Informal meetings to\nbecome familiar with the SHPC's design standards may be arranged by contacting the Administrator. The Administrator can\ndetermine if a preapplication review is needed. However, a preapplication review is required for any exterior project\ninvolving:\n-\nNew construction (excluding accessory structures under 500 square feet).\n- Any exterior building or site alteration involving a cost of more than $10,000.\n"}, {"page": "205", "text": "Property owners requesting a preapplication review should provide commissioners with photographs of the subject\nproperty showing existing conditions and preliminary drawings indicating desired changes. A site plan of the property should\nalso be furnished. This information is necessary to facilitate a reasonable discussion of the project. Preapplication review\nmaterials shall be submitted to the Administrator at least fourteen (14) working days prior to the meeting of the\npreapplication review subcommittee.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 2: DEFINITIONS.\n2.1 Roof Form and Pitch\nThe Roof Form and Pitch are among the major distinguishing characteristics of different styles of architecture. Roofs can\nbe flat, pitched, hipped, curved, or arranged in various combinations of all of these forms. Certain architectural styles are\ndistinguished by roof types - for example, a Second Empire style building always displays some form of a mansard or curved\nroof. Buildings styled after Classical forms usually feature simple hipped or pitched roofs.\nRoofing materials contribute to the character of early Swansboro buildings. Depending on the ages and styles of the\nbuildings, roofs can be covered with a variety of materials ranging from asphalt shingles to terne-plated metal. It is extremely\nimportant to install appropriate roofing material when conserving the character of early buildings.\n1) ASPHALT SHINGLES. Shingles manufactured from saturated roofing felts (rag, asbestos, or fiber glass) coated with\nasphalt and having mineral granules on the side exposed to weather.\n2) DOWNSPOUT. A vertical pipe, often of sheet metal, used to conduct water from a roof drain or gutter to the ground\nor cistern.\n3) FLASHING. A thin impervious material placed in construction to prevent water penetration, to provide water\ndrainage or both, especially between a roof and a wall.\n4) GABLE. The vertical triangular piece of a wall at the end of a ridged roof, from the level of the eaves to the summit.\n5) GALVANIZE. To coat steel or iron with zinc, as for example, by immersing it in a bath of molten zinc.\n6) GAMBREL ROOF. A gable roof more or less symmetrical, having four inclined surfaces, the pair meeting at the\nridge having a shallower pitch.\n7) GUTTER. A shallow channel of metal or wood set immediately below or built in along the leaves of a building to\ncatch and carry off rainwater.\n8) HIPPED ROOF. A roof without gables, each of whose sides, generally four, lies in a single plane and joins the others\nat an apex or ridge.\n9) JERKIN HEAD ROOF. A roof whose end had been formed into a shape midway between a gable and a hip,\nresulting in a truncated or \"clipped\" appearance; sometimes called a \"clipped gable\".\n10) LEAD ROOF. A flat roof covered with sheet lead.\n11) MANSARD ROOF. A modification of the hipped roof in which each side has two planes, the upper being more\nshallow. This roof is characteristic of the Second Empire style.\n12) PANTILES. A roofing tile that has the shape of an S laid on its side.\n13) PITCHED ROOF. A roof having two slopes that meet at a central ridge, sometimes called a \"gable end roof\".\n14) ROOFING TILE. A tile for roofing, usually of burnt clay; available in many configurations and types such as plain\ntiles, single-lap tiles, and interlocking tiles.\n15) SHAKES. Any thick, handsplit shingle usually edge-grained; formed by splitting a short log into tapered radial\nsections.\n16) SHEET METAL. A flat, rolled metal product, rectangular in cross section and form; when used as roofing material, it\nis usually terne or zinc-plated.\n17) SHINGLES. A roofing unit of wood, asphalt, slate, tile or other materials cut to stock lengths, widths and\nthicknesses; used as an exterior covering on roofs and applied in an overlapping fashion.\n18) SLATE. A hard, brittle, metamorphic rock consisting mainly of clay materials characterized by good cleavage along\nparallel planes; used in thin sheets as roofing or in thicker slabs for flooring.\n19) TARPAPER. A roofing material manufactured by saturating a dry felt with asphalt and then coating it with a harder\nasphalt mixed with a fine mineral.\n20) TERNE-PLATE. Sheet metal coated with terne metal which is an alloy of lead containing up to 20% tin.\n21) TERRA-COTTA. Hard, unglazed fired clay; used for ornamental work and roof and floor tile.\n22) TIN.\n"}, {"page": "206", "text": "(1) A lustrous white, soft and malleable metal having a low melting point; relatively unaffected by exposure to air;\nused for making alloys and coating sheet metal;\n(2) To coat with a layer of tin.\n23) ZINC. A hard bluish-white metal, brittle at normal temperatures and not subject to corrosion; used in making alloys\nand for galvanizing sheet metal.\n2.2 Fenestration Pattern\nThe FENESTRATION PATTERN of a building is the arrangement of doors and windows in its facades. Builders use these\nvarious arrangements, the sizes and proportions of openings and the decorative elements associated with them, to achieve\nstylistic effects on buildings.\n1) AWNING. A roof-like covering of canvas, often adjustable, over a window, door, etc., to provide protection against\nthe sun, rain, and wind. Aluminum lawnings were developed in the 1950s.\n2) BAY WINDOW. A projecting bay with windows that extend floor space on the interior and usually extends to ground\nlevel on the exterior.\n3) BEVELED GLASS. Glass panes whose edges are ground and polished at a slight angle so that patterns are created\nwhen panes are set adjacent to one another.\n4) BLINDS. External or internal louvered wooden shutters that exclude direct sunlight but admit light through a window\nor door. This feature is found on many southern houses since its exterior placement intercepts the sun's heat before it\nstrikes a window pane, thereby helping to cool the interior.\n5) BOW WINDOW. A curved bay window.\n6) CASEMENT WINDOW. A window which swings open along its entire length, usually on hinges fixed to the sides of\nthe opening into which it is fitted.\n7) CASING. The exposed trim molding, framing, or lining around a door or window; may be either flat or molded.\n8) CLERESTORY WINDOWS. Windows located relatively high up in a wall that often tend to form a continuous band.\nThis was a feature of many Gothic cathedrals and was later adapted to many of the Revival styles found here.\n9) CORNER BLOCK. A block placed at a corner of the casing around a wooden door or window frame, usually treated\nornamentally\n10) DOUBLE-HUNG WINDOW. A window with two sashes which open by sliding up and down in a cased frame.\n11) ETCHED GLASS.

A vertical member dividing a window area and forming part of the window frame.\n20) MUNTIN. A molding forming part of the frame of a window sash and holding one side of a pane.\n21) ORIEL WINDOW. A projecting bay with windows, generally on the second story of a building. An oriel is adopted\nfrom Gothic forms.\n22) OVERDOOR LIGHT. A glazed area above a doorway and sometimes continued vertically down the sides; often\ndecoratively treated. An overdoor light is common feature on many 19th and early 20th century buildings.\n23) PALLADIAN WINDOW. A window with three openings, the central arched and usually wider and taller than the\nothers.\n24) PANE. A flat sheet of glass, cut to size for glazing a window, door, etc.; often a small size, larger ones being\nusually called \"sheets.\" Once installed, the pane is referred to as a Light or Window Light.\n25) SASH. The moving part of a window.\n26) SHUTTERS. Small wooden \"doors\" on the outside (of windows), originally used for security purposes. In the 19th\n"}, {"page": "207", "text": "century, they were closed over windows at night or during storms.\n27) SIDELIGHT. A narrow window area beside an outside door, generally seen in the Greek Revival Style.\n28) SILL. The lowest horizontal member in a wall opening.\n29) TRABEATED ENTRANCE. A standard classical entrance, featuring an overdoor light and sidelights.\n30) TRACERY. An ornamental division of an opening, especially a large window, usually made with wood. Tracery is\nfound in buildings of Gothic influence.\n31) TRANSOM. An overdoor light, usually hinged to be opened for secure ventilation at ceiling level.\n32) WINDOW CAP. The uppermost part of a window frame.\n33) WINDOW GLASS. A hard, brittle inorganic substance; ordinarily transparent or translucent, normally a soda-lime-\nsilica compound fabricated in continuous flat sheets up to six feet wide, in thickness from 0.05 to 0.22 inches thick.\n2.3 Vernacular Forms\nVernacular Forms, or native, local forms, are more commonly found in 19th and early 20th century buildings and\nneighborhoods than in newer construction. Many buildings in early Swansboro feature roomy porches and similar structures\nthat function as outdoor living rooms. There are several types of porches and outdoor spaces that lend character to early\nSwansboro buildings.\n1) ARBOR. A open structure of trees or shrubs closely planted, either twined together and self-supporting or supported\non a light, lattice-work frame.\n2) BALCONY. A projecting platform on a building, sometimes supported from below, sometimes cantilevered; enclosed\nwith a railing or balustrade.\n3) DECK. An uncovered porch, usually at the rear of the building; popular in modern residential design.\n4) FLORIDA ROOM. A glass enclosed porch, usually placed in order to obtain maximum advantage of the winter sun\nand usually furnished with potted plants; a conservatory.\n5) GAZEBO. A summer house situated to take advantage of a view.\n6) PATIO. An open, paved court enclosed on three sides by elements of a building.\n7) PORCH. A covered outdoor area attached to the house, usually roofed and generally open sided with a floor and\nbalustrades.\n8)\nPORTICO. A small entrance porch or covered walk consisting of a roof supported by open columns.\n9) SCREEN PORCH. A porch or veranda space that is enclosed with woven wire cloth, or screening, to keep insects out\nwhile allowing maximum ventilation.\n10) SUMMER HOUSE. A garden house of light, airy design used in the summer for protection from the sun.\n11) VERANDA, VERANDAH. A covered porch or balcony, extending along the outside of a building, planned for summer\nleisure.\n2.4 Principals of Construction Uses - Vernacular Forms\nThese structural elements, combined with landscaping techniques, were used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to\nincorporate comfortable living into the regional climate. They also seem to indicate different social attitudes than those\nexisting today - verandas and other outdoor living spaces in early Swansboro neighborhoods tend to be found on or near the\nbuilding's street facade. This apparently encouraged neighborly dropping-in and visiting. Today most builders of new homes\nsituate outdoor living space to the rear of the structure and present a formal facade to the street.\nDecks are a modern amenity that an individual may wish to add to an early Swansboro building. If this is the case, every\neffort should be made to place them to the rear of the building. Decks should be incorporated into the facade of the house\nby screening under them with an architectural element such as lattice, or with vegetation that displays a good screening\nquality.\n2.5 Color\nColor schemes for early Swansboro buildings may be one of the most discussed subjects among local preservationists.\nMany times, one of the first exterior projects a new owner of an early home undertakes is the exterior repainting of the\nhouse. While an exterior paint job is not an irreversible change to a building, it is an expensive one; so a careful study of the\nstyle of the building and the color scheme appropriate to that style makes sense.\nColor was an element of the original design intent of an architect or builder; but since early photographs are black and\nwhite, only tones and contrasts can be determined. However, if an individual wishes to reproduce accurately the original\ncolor scheme of an early Swansboro building, he can sometimes obtain written documentation describing it. If this is not\navailable, paint scraping samples can be made; professional preservationists such as those on the staff of the North\nCarolina Division of Archives and History can assist in this process.\n"}, {"page": "208", "text": "If the original color scheme of an early Swansboro building is not pleasing to its new owner, then it is appropriate to\nchoose a different combination, bearing in mind the architectural style of the building, the surrounding streetscape and the\nclimatic conditions of this region.\n1) ALKYD RESIN PAINT. A common modern paint using alkyd (of a group of thermoplastic synthetic resins) as the\nvehicle for the pigment; often confused with oil paint.\n2) CAULK. To fill a joint, crack, and the like, with caulking.\n3) CAULKING. A resilient mastic compound, often having a silicone, bituminous or rubber base; used to seal cracks, fill\njoints, prevent leakage and/or provide waterproofing.\n4) CHALKING. The formation of a powder surface condition from the disintegration of a binder or elastomer in a paint\ncoating; caused by weathering or otherwise destructive environment.\n5) CHECKING. Small cracks in film of paint or varnish which do not completely penetrate to the previous coat; the cracks\nare in a pattern roughly similar to a checkerboard.\n6) LATEX PAINT. A paint having a latex binder ( an emulsion of finely dispersed particles of natural or synthetic rubber\nor plastic materials in water).\n7) MILDEW. A fungus that grows and feeds on paint, cotton and linen fabrics, etc., which are exposed to moisture;\ncauses discoloration and decomposition of the surface.\n8) OIL PAINT. A paint in which a drying oil is the vehicle for the pigment; rarely used since the mid-20th century.\n9) PAINT. A liquid solution of pigment in a suitable vehicle of oil, organic solvent or water; liquid when applied, but dries\nto form an adherent, protective and decorative coating.\n10) PAINT STRIPPER. A liquid which is applied to a dry paint to cause it to soften or lose adhesion so that it may be\nremoved easily.\n11) PIGMENT. A finely ground inorganic powder which is dispersed in a liquid vehicle to make paint; may provide, in\naddition to color, many of the essential properties of paint - opacity, hardness, durability and corrosion resistance.\n12) PRIMER. A paint, applied as first coat, which serves the function of sealing and filling on wood, plaster and masonry.\n13) SANDING, FLATTENING DOWN, RUBBING. Smoothing a surface with abrasive paper or cloth, either by hand or by\nmachine.\n14) SANDBLAST. An extremely abrasive method of cleaning brick, masonry, or wood that involves directing high-\npowered jets of sand against a surface.\n15) WATERBLAST. Similar to sandblast except water is used as an abrasive; like sandblasting, high pressure water\nstreams can damage wood and masonry surfaces.\n2.6 Elements of Composition\nThe composition of a building is the arrangement or the bringing together of its parts or elements. Architectural\ncompositions in early buildings can range from simple, straightforward designs to complex arrangements that create visual\ninterest both in the building and in the surrounding streetscape.\nWhile an architectural composition is made up of all the elements of the various styles - materials, roof forms, fenestration\npatterns, and so on - there are some elements of composition that are added to various architectural styles that do not fall\nunder the various other categories. The following list describes some of those that are found on early Swansboro buildings.\n1) ANTA (pl. Antae). A pier, square in plan and having a capital; this was sometimes used in Neoclassical architecture in\nplace of a round column.\n2) ARCADE. A row of arches with their supporting columns or piers.\n3) ARCH. A structure formed of wedge-shaped stones, bricks, or other objects laid so as to maintain one another firmly\nin position; a rounded arch generally represents Classical or Romanesque influence while a pointed arch denotes Gothic\ninfluence.\n4) COLONNADE. A row of columns which supports an entablature; this is a feature of Greek Revival and Neoclassical\nstyles.\n5) COLUMN. A vertical shaft or pillar that supports or appears to support a load.\n6) CRENELLATED PEDIMENT. A triangular gable end with alternating indentations and raised portions.\n7) CUPOLA. A small vault on top of a roof; sometimes spherical in shape, sometimes square with a mansard or conical\nroof.\n8) DORMER. A structure containing a window (or windows) that projects through a pitched roof.\n9) EAVE. The part of a sloping roof that projects beyond a wall.\n"}, {"page": "209", "text": "10) ENTABLATURE. A horizontal member divided into triple sections consisting from bottom to top, of an architrave\n(symbolizing a beam), a frieze, usually ornamented, and cornice.\n11) FOUNDATION. The supporting portion of a structure below the first floor construction, or below grade, including\nfootings.\n12) FRONTISPIECE. A decorated chief pediment or ornamental details on the bay of a building.\n13) HALF-TIMBERED. Descriptive of buildings of the Tudor style (16th and 17th centuries) which were built with strong\ntimber foundations, support knees and studs, and whose walls were filled with plaster or masonry materials such as brick. In\nthe United States, buildings in the Tudor Revival style of architecture feature half-timbered construction.\n2.7 Basic Shape and Form\nThe basic shape and form of a building generally can be seen by looking at its floor plans and elevations. The style of an\nolder building usually dictated its shape. Buildings inspired by classical forms are generally foursquare or rectangular in\nshape while those inspired by Gothic forms or vernacular revivals can display complex or fanciful arrangements of shapes.\nSurviving early Swansboro buildings dating from before the advent of central heating usually display floor plans that allow\nindividual rooms to be shut off. The styles of architecture from those years - Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival - suited\nthemselves to the need to conserve heat through a symmetrical arrangement of rooms, each of which could be closed off,\nand usually reflected a symmetrical arrangement of shapes on the exterior of the buildings.\n1) BAY. Within a structure, a regularly repeated spatial element usually defined in plan by beams and their supports, or in\nelevation by repetition of windows and doors in the building facade.\n2) ELEVATION. A drawing showing the vertical elements of a building, either exterior or interior, as a direct projection to\na vertical plane.\n3) STORY. The space in a building between floor levels or between a floor and a roof above.\n2.8 Principals of Construction Methods - Basic Shape and Form\nThe relationships and proportions of shapes and forms make the basis for the character of a building. They are the anchor\non which the other structural elements are applied. During a restoration or rehabilitation project, special note should be\nmade of the shape and form of the building. If an addition to an early Swansboro building is needed, it should reflect the\nproportions of the original design and complement the character of the building. A well designed, skillfully executed\ncontemporary addition often can add an intriguing quality to a historic building. Where this has occurred successfully, the\ndesigner usually is completely familiar with the significant characteristics of the older building and respects them in the\ndesign of the addition.\nThe removal of an unsympathetic, poorly designed addition to an early Swansboro building can greatly enhance its\nappearance. But the removal of exemplary later additions in order to restore a building to its original or conjectured original\nappearance should be carefully studied. Just as a well done contemporary addition can enhance a building, an accumulation\nof good earlier additions can add depth and quality to it. Before any addition is removed, it should be evaluated for its\ncharacter, significance, and utility. It is wise to determine exactly what is being removed and retained by sketching floor\nplans and elevations.\n2.9 Materials\nMaterials are the substance or matter that are used to construct a building or from which elements of a building are\nfabricated. Wood was the most commonly used building material in Swansboro neighborhoods. Most of the homes in these\nareas are of \"balloon frame\" construction, a Victorian era building innovation that set up all exterior bearing walls and\npartitions with single vertical studs and nailed the floor joists to those studs. This was an important advance in building\ntechnology as it allowed the rapid construction of larger numbers of houses by fewer men. Before this, buildings exhibited\n\"post and beam\" framing; that is a system in which the horizontal members rest on posts that were separate from walls. This\nmethod, while time-consuming, produced very sturdy buildings and occasionally one finds building contracts from the\nVictorian era that specify this earlier type of construction. Clapboard, flush siding, board and batten, or textured siding was\nthen applied to the exterior; and depending on the styles of the era and the taste and financial conditions of the owner,\ndecorative details were added.\n2.10 Siding\nExterior siding is the most common architectural element that is fabricated from wood. There are a multitude of forms that\nwood siding can take; it can be clapboard, flush, textured, or board and batten. Many times the form of siding displayed on a\nSwansboro building is one of the hallmarks of its style. There also are many commercial limitations of wooden siding of\nwhich one should be aware.\n1) ALUMINUM SIDING. Sheets of exterior architectural covering, usually with a colored finish, fabricated from aluminum,\na lustrous silver-white, nonmagnetic, lightweight metal which is very malleable and possesses good thermal and electrical\nconductivity and is a good reflector of heat and light. Aluminum siding was developed in the early 1940s and became\nincreasingly common in the 1950s and 1960s.\n2) ASBESTOS SIDING. Dense, rigid board containing a high proportion of asbestos fibers bonded with Portland cement;\nresistant to fire, flame or weathering and has a low resistance to heat flow. It is usually applied as large overlapping shingles.\n"}, {"page": "210", "text": "Asbestos siding was applied to many buildings in the 1950s.\n3) ASPHALT SIDING. Siding manufactured from saturated construction felts (rag, asbestos, or fiberglass) coated with\nasphalt and finished with mineral granules on the side exposed to the weather; it sometimes displays designs seeking to\nimitate brick or stone. Asphalt siding was applied to many buildings in the 1950s.\n4)\nBOARD AND BATTEN. Closely applied vertical boards, the joints of which are covered by vertical narrow wooden\nstrips; usually found on Gothic Revival style buildings.\n5) CLAPBOARD. Horizontal wooden boards, tapered at the upper end and laid so as to cover a portion of a similar board\nunderneath and to be covered by a similar one above. The exposed face of clapboard is usually less than 6\" wide. This was\na common outer face of 19th and early 20th century buildings.\n6) COMPOSITION BOARD. A building board, usually intended to resemble clapboard, fabricated from wood or paper\nfabric under pressure and at an elevated temperature, usually with a binder.\n7) FLUSH SIDING. Wooden siding which lies on a single plane. This was commonly applied horizontally except when it\nwas applied vertically to accent an architectural feature.\n8) GERMAN SIDING. Wooden siding with a concave upper edge which fits into a corresponding rabbet in the siding\nabove.\n9)\nPLYWOOD SIDING. Laminated wood sheets fabricated of veneers bonded together with waterproof glue; the\nexposed surface is usually grooved to resemble vertical ship lap boards or board and batten in reverse relief.\n10) TEXTURED SIDING. Wood cut in various flat patterns such as half-rounds or scallops and applied to portions of\nfacades to create a picturesque or romantic look. This treatment was generally used in Queen Anne style buildings. Surface\ntextures are often found in the following designs:\na) COMPOSITE. A design formed by two overlapping rows of scallop-shaped shingles overlapped by a row of diamond-\nshaped shingles overlapped by two overlapping rows of scallop-shaped shingles.\nb) DIAMOND. A design formed by overlapping rows of shingles shaped like vertical parallelograms.\nc)\nSCALLOP. A design formed by overlapping rows of shingles shaped like a rectangle with rounded ends; sometimes\ncalled \"fish scale.\"\nd) STAGGERED BUTT. A design formed by overlapping rows of alternating small and large rectangular-shaped\nshingles.\n11) VINYL SIDING. Sheets of thermal plastic compound made from chloride or vinyl acetates, as well as some plastics\nmade from styrene and other chemicals, usually fabricated to resemble clapboard.\n2.11 Principals of Construction Methods - Siding\nSynthetic sidings destroy the aesthetic appeal of the building to which they are applied. At their best, they conceal the\nhistoric fabric of a building and at worst, they remove or destroy with nail holes the materials and craftsmanship which reflect\nour cultural heritage. Owners should avoid the use of such materials and maintain the wood siding of the buildings instead.\nTextured wall shingles on early Swansboro buildings were usually painted, sometimes the same color as the rest of the\nsiding, sometimes in a complementary color to add emphasis, and sometimes left natural. When restoring or rehabilitating a\nbuilding with siding, it is very wise to retain as many of the original wooden shingles as possible and to replace lost or\ndamaged ones with the same type and in the same design. Removing or covering original siding on early Swansboro\nbuildings can subvert the intentions of the original designer and harm the character and unique quality of the building.\n2.12 Brick\nBrick was a more expensive building material than wood and therefore is not as common in early Swansboro\nneighborhoods. Old brick walls have certain characteristics which should be preserved and enhanced. Properly cared for,\na\nbrick wall develops a patina with age and possesses a definite maintenance advantage over wood siding.\nBrick is laid in a pattern known as bond. Most buildings display the pattern called common bond that features a variety of\nstretcher - header ratios. Before the use of wire wall reinforcement became widespread, bond was an important element in\nthe stability of brick construction. Today it creates a pattern of order and repetition that adds a pleasing element to the\nfacade of a brick building.\n1) BOND. The laying of bricks or stones regularly in a wall according to a recognized pattern for strength. Masonry bond\nis essential to brickwork when wire reinforcement is not used.\na) COMMON BOND. Also called American bond; a brick wall pattern in which the fifth, sixth, or seventh course is a\nheader course.\nb) ENGLISH BOND. Brick walling in which alternate courses are composed entirely of stretchers or entirely of headers.\nc) FLEMISH BOND. Brick walling in which every course is composed of alternating headers and stretchers.\nd) RUNNING BOND. A common contemporary pattern of continuous stretcher courses with no headers; used only with\n"}, {"page": "211", "text": "single wythe walls or reinforced masonry.\n2) BOND COURSE. A course of headers.\n3) BRICK. In temperate climates, bricks are made of clay mixed with some coarser materials such as silt or sand, and\nburnt, not baked, in a kiln. The common standard brick is now about 7-3/4 X 3-5/8 2-1/4 inches, but many other sizes exist.\n4) BRICK VENEER. An outer covering, usually for a timber building, consisting of a single wythe brick wall attached to\nthe supporting wall with ties.\n5) COURSES. Parallel layers of bricks, stones, blocks, slates, tiles, shingles, etc., usually horizontal, including any mortar\nlaid with them.\n6) HEADER. A brick laid across the thickness of a wall to bond together different wythe of a wall; the exposed end of a\nbrick.\n7) HYDRATED LIME. Quicklime which has been submerged in water to make lime putty.\n8) JOINTS. The mortar between adjacent bricks or stones.\na) CONCAVE JOINT. A durable mortar joint, hollowed out by drawing a 1/2-inch diameter bar tool along it while green;\nthis is the most common joint used today.\nb) FLAT JOINT. A mortar joint whose surface is flush with the brickwork; usually used for concealed or unfinished\nsurfaces.\nc) GRAPEVINE JOINT. An archaic joint similar to a concave joint with a groove scribed into the center of it; rarely used\nafter Colonial times, it is not often seen in early Swansboro buildings.\nd) KEYED JOINT. Concave pointing of a mortar joint.\ne) WEATHER-STRUCK JOINT. A mortar joint smoothed off by pressing the trowel in at the upper edge so as to throw\nrain out to the face of the brick.\n9) MORTAR. A mixture of Portland cement, lime, putty, and sand in various proportions used for laying bricks or stones.\nUntil the use of hard Portland cement became general, the softer lime-clay or lime-sand mortars and masonry cement were\ncommon.\n10) POINTING. Raking out deteriorated mortar joints and filling into them a surface mortar to repair the joint.\n11) PORTLAND CEMENT. A very hard and strong hydraulic cement (one that hardens under water) made by heating a\nslurry of clay and limestone in a kiln.\n12) SANDBLAST. An abrasive method of cleaning bricks, masonry, or wood that involves directing high-powered jets of\nsand against a surface; sandblasting damages wood or masonry surfaces.\n13) STRETCHER. A brick or stone laid with its length parallel to the length of the wall.\n14) WATERBLAST. Similar to sandblast except that water is used as an abrasive; like sandblasting, high pressure water\njets can damage wood and masonry surfaces.\n15) WYTHE. Parallel vertical layers of masonry units that make up the thickness of a wall.\n2.13 Architectural Details\nThe architectural details of an older building, whether they are applied with the exuberance of Victorian-era styles or with\nthe restraint of the classically inspired, are signatures of design. Often, an individual will be attracted to a building because\nof the presence of these details - the \"gingerbread\" or carvings associated with Victorian houses, or because of the simple\nbut proportional lines of a shotgun or four square house.\n1) ADAMESQUE. Details in the style of the Adam brothers, designers whose work was characterized by the use of\nclassical ornament.\n2) ARCHITRAVE.

If a\nproperty owner is restoring the exterior of a building and is seeking to replace missing architectural details, it may be\npossible to find some of them in salvage yards or in antique shops. Before undertaking the replacement of details, it is wise\nto be completely familiar with the style and characteristics of the building so that the introduction of inappropriate details can\nbe avoided.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005)\nSECTION 3: ROOFS.\n3.1 Roofs - Standards\n1) Preserve or restore original and significant later roof forms, shapes, and major roof architectural elements such as\ndormers, gables, chimneys, and leave overhangs. It is not appropriate to make alterations to the front or other primary\nportions of the roof of a contributing structure if that roof slope can be seen from the public view.\n2) Preserve, maintain, and repair historic roofing details and materials such as slate, standing-seam metal, and tile\nwherever possible. Replace in-kind only if necessary due to deterioration or damage.\n3) New roofing materials should be compatible with either the existing or original roofing material. The new material\nshould match the historic material as closely as possible in color, shape, size, and texture. Asphalt or fiberglass-asphalt\nshingles are acceptable substitutes for standing-seam tin, wood shingles, or metal shingles, provided the new replacement\nshingles are of a darker solid color. Barn tin (also known as \"five-vee\" tin) or coated steel may be used to replace a standing-\nseam tin roof in new construction.\n4) Retain historic roof-top features such as ornamental leaves, cornices, rake-boards, dormers, gables, chimneys, finials,\ncresting, steeples, belfries, cupolas, and railings. These elements all add much to the overall architectural character of a\nstructure. All such original and significant later features should be preserved and restored, rather than removed.\n5)\nContemporary or non-historic roof features should be installed on areas of the roof not seen from the public view or on\n"}, {"page": "215", "text": "other secondary roofs. Included are skylights, roof-mounted vents, dormers, chimneys, antennas and solar collectors. In\ncertain instances, new dormers may be permitted on side or rear elevations if their design is compatible with the building\nand the roofline.\n6) Install new gutters without damaging or obscuring architectural features. Gutters of all materials except copper shall\nhave a painted finish. Half-round gutters are appropriate for most contributing properties. Gutters are usually reviewed as a\n\"minor works\" item. If installed on a contributing building, the SHPC must review application at SHPC meeting.\n7) Ridge vents, where needed, should be of the low profile type and should not diminish the original design of the roof or\ndestroy any character-defining architectural details. Other vents, such as gable vents and roof-mounted vents, should be\ninstalled so as not to be visible from the public view where possible. In the event that they must be visible, they should be\ninstalled to respect the architectural details and character of the subject building.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 4 EXTERIOR WALL COVERING, TRIM, AND ORNAMENTATION.\n4.1 Exterior Wall Covering, Trim, and Ornamentation - Standards\n1) Preserve and maintain existing original exterior wall covering, trim, ornamentation, and other original decorative\nelements.\n2) Preserve and repair original elements wherever possible. Use preservation techniques which encourage repair, such\nas epoxies, splicing, and patching where applicable, rather than wholesale replacement.\n3) Replace historic elements only where the original is too deteriorated to repair. If replacement is necessary and\njustifiable, use new replacement elements that match the original as closely as possible in all properties - shape, profile,\ntexture, and detailing.\n4) Prepare surfaces for painting using the gentlest means possible. Low-pressure power washing should be used only\nafter a test panel of washing has been performed by the contractor and reviewed by the owner for excessive damage. Sand\nblasting and high- pressure water blasting are not appropriate treatments.\n5) The use of synthetic or pressed wood, vinyl, cement composite, or aluminum siding is not appropriate on buildings\nwhich contribute to the character of the historic district (refer to the Synthetic Siding Policy). The SHPC may allow\nreplacement of existing synthetic siding with new synthetic siding if the proposed replacement will be more in keeping with\nthe original appearance of the structure. NOTE: Artificial siding with a heavy wood grain will not be permitted.\n6) Remove synthetic siding from existing contributing buildings wherever possible. Remove in the gentlest possible\nmanner to avoid damage to the wood below.\n4.2 Synthetic Siding Policy\nThe use of synthetic siding materials is not permitted within the historic district. Modern synthetic or substitute materials\nsuch as vinyl, aluminum, pressed wood, or cement products shall not be used to cover or replace wood siding on structures\nthat contribute to the character of the historic district, or on new structures. The appearance, surface textures, details, and\nother key visual characteristics of synthetic sidings are not appropriate in the district.\nIn the case of structures that are presently covered with synthetic siding, the Swansboro Historic Preservation\nCommission may allow for a change to another synthetic siding if the proposed new siding is more in keeping with the\noriginal appearance of the structure or the character of the district. In an effort to prevent the removal or damage of\narchitectural details, the SHPC may specify which areas of the structure shall be covered with synthetic siding products as a\ncondition of approval.\nSynthetic siding products have a number of potential drawbacks, which far outweigh their benefits, including the following:\n-The application of artificial siding over wood may cause moisture retention and eventual deterioration;\n-The insulation value of artificial siding and materials applied behind the siding is often overrated and of minimal value;\n-Artificial siding may cause house fires to burn longer and hotter, and may make fire extinguishing more difficult;\n-Techniques used in the installation of artificial siding are likely to cause damage to the original siding and trim\nunderneath, including leakage of water through improperly detailed or uncaulked joints;\n-Artificial siding prevents the detection of deterioration of original wood elements that are hidden from view.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 5: WINDOWS AND DOORS.\n5.1 Windows and Doors - Standards\n1) Retain and preserve historic windows and doors, including all significant related elements such as frames, sashes,\nshutters, hardware, old glass, sills, and moldings.\n2) Repair existing historic windows and doors where possible, rather than replacing entire window or door units. Use\n"}, {"page": "216", "text": "techniques such as wood epoxies and wood patches to repair and strengthen deteriorated wood elements. Replace only\nthose elements that cannot be repaired.\n3) Use replacement windows and doors that match the existing historic elements as closely as possible. If replacement\nwindows or doors are required, consider first replacing only the deteriorated element, such as a single sash or door, rather\nthan the entire frame or unit. Any new replacements shall match the original in all dimensions and detailing as closely as\npossible.\n4) Use storm windows to improve energy efficiency where needed. New storm units should have a baked-on paint finish\ncompatible with the color of the house. Unpainted aluminum is not appropriate. Storm windows for double-hung sashes shall\nhave horizontal dividers that are in alignment with the horizontal meeting rails or the original upper and lower sashes. Storm\nwindows are usually a \"minor works\" item.\n5) Replacement of historic windows and doors for the sole purpose of improved thermal performance is not appropriate.\nStorm windows and doors should be used.\n6) Tinted glass is not appropriate in the historic district in any area visible from the public view. Energy-saving or \"low-E\"\nglass may be used only if it is not tinted.\n7) False muntins or snap-in grilles are not appropriate for windows visible from public view. New thermal-pane windows\nmust match the original windows in overall size and opening area. New windows should have either true divided lights or\nthree- dimensional grilles on both the interior and exterior of the window. Standard thermal-pane windows will be permitted\non the rear or other areas not visible from the public view. Existing original frames should be retained and reused with the\naddition of new siding tracks to hold the replacement sashes.\n8) Use storm doors to improve energy efficiency where needed. New storm doors should be compatible with the original\nexterior doors and with the style and period of the structure. Wood storm doors of the full-view or large single-pane type are\nmost appropriate because they do not obscure the original door. Louvered wood doors are also appropriate. Metal storm\ndoors should be the full-view type and have a baked-on enamel paint finish in a color that is compatible with the colors of the\nstructure. Standard or non-historic storm doors are appropriate only on the rear or other area not visible from public view.\nScreen doors should be appropriate for the period and style of the structure.\n9) Preserve and repair original or historic shutters, or replace in-kind. It is appropriate to add louvered shutters to a\nhistoric structure if there is evidence that it once had blinds. All new shutters shall be of wood, and installed so that they will\nfit the window frame opening when closed and shall be of the correct proportions for each window. New blinds shall be\nprovided with operable hardware, consisting of hinges, pintles, and holdbacks located in the appropriate position. Shutters\nmade of synthetic or substitute materials, such as vinyl, are not appropriate.\n10) Original or historic windows or doors and their related frames and trim shall not be altered or removed on the main\nfacades visible from the public view unless this action is part of a documented restoration to an earlier appearance.\n11) New windows and doors should not be added to the primary facades or front elevation, and are usually not\nappropriate on any other area seen from the public view. New window and door openings shall not alter the historic\ncharacter of the building nor cause damage to historic materials or other significant architectural features. They must be\ndetailed and sized to be compatible with the existing structure.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 6 PORCHES AND ENTRANCES.\n6.1 Porches and Entrances - Standards\n1) Retain and preserve historic porches, entrances, and doorways including related features such as railings, posts or\ncolumns, ceilings, steps, lattice, flooring, piers, ornamental trim, and other character-defining elements.\n2) Repair, rather than replace, historic porch and entrance elements wherever feasible. Use repair techniques which\npreserve historic materials, including patching, epoxy repair, reinforcing, or splicing-in of new wood in place of deteriorated\nsections. Replacement elements should match the original in size, shape, pattern, material, color, and texture. Modern stock\nmillwork is usually not appropriate.\n3) Use appropriate materials in the repair and restoration of historic porches. Woods that are naturally rot-resistant or\ntreated will provide the greatest durability for exposed elements such as railings, steps, flooring, and floor framing. The use\nof pressure-treated wood is appropriate when painted within six months.\n4) The enclosure or other alteration of original or historic front porches is not appropriate in the historic district. Avoid\nenclosing porches at sides or other secondary areas that are visible from the public view. The enclosure of porches at the\nrear, or other areas not seen from the public view, is appropriate if the enclosure is designed and constructed in a manner\nthat preserves the historic character and features of the porch.\n5) Use architectural details and ornamentation that are compatible with the style, period, and detailing of the porch and\nstructure. The creation of a false historical appearance, such as adding Victorian ornamentation to a plain early 20th century\nporch, is not appropriate.\n6) Reconstruct missing porches or porch details based on accurate documentation of such features. Such documentation\nmay include: evidence found on the subject building, historic photographs, or compatible details found on another porch in\n"}, {"page": "217", "text": "the district of the same period and general style. The owner shall provide the SHPC with such documentation in the\napplication for a Certificate of Appropriateness.\n7) It is not appropriate to add new porches, entrances, or balconies to primary elevations or other areas of a building that\nare readily seen from the public view if none existed historically.\n8) New handicapped access ramps and other modifications to improve access shall be designed so that the modifications\nare reversible and do not damage or obscure the building's architectural features or diminish its historic character.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 7 BRICKWORK AND MASONRY.\n7.1 Brickwork and Masonry - Standards\n1)\nRetain and preserve historic brick and masonry elements, including walls, chimneys, foundations, and retaining walls.\nPreserve masonry elements that are character- defining features of the building or property.\n2) Repair and restore historic masonry elements, rather than replace. Remove vegetation and vines from masonry to\nprevent structural or moisture damage.\n3) Clean historic masonry only with low-pressure water washing and mild detergents formulated for the specific\napplication. Use chemical cleaners formulated for historic masonry only if water and detergent cleaners are not effective.\n4) Sand blasting, high-pressure water blasting, and other abrasive cleaning methods which may damage historic\nmasonry are not appropriate in the historic district.\n5) Water repellant sealers are generally not appropriate because they may trap moisture, causing deterioration or\ndiscoloration.\n6) For repointing, use only mortars that are compatible with the historic mortars in color, strength, and joint finish or\nsurface tooling. For older, softer brick, use a mortar mix consisting of six parts sand, three parts mason's lime, and one (1)\npart white Portland cement. Maintain the historic joint width and bond patterns when making repairs.\n7) Use only hand tools to remove deteriorated mortar joints, under the direction of a skilled mason. Do not use power\ntools or saws to remove mortar joints.\n8) When replacing damaged brick or stone, use replacements that match the original units as closely as possible.\n9) Avoid painting masonry surfaces that were not painted historically. When painting masonry that has been previously\npainted, use acrylic latex paints for best durability.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 8 FOUNDATIONS.\n8.1 Foundations - Standards\n1) Retain and preserve original and historic foundations and related elements wherever possible, including pier size,\nvents, grilles, lattice, materials, and other significant details.\n2) Retain and preserve existing historic materials wherever possible, rather than replace. For repairs or rebuilding, select\nnew brick, mortar, ballast stones, and other materials to match the historic materials as closely as possible in all respects.\n3) New vents or access doors should be centered between piers. Use inconspicuous vents, such as black iron or dark\nplastic, rather than unpainted aluminum. Locate access doors and other new openings in areas not visible from public view.\n4)\nFor infilling between existing brick piers, construct a curtain wall that is recessed approximately 1\" to 2\" back from the\nouter face of the piers so the original piers stand out; use this treatment for both old and new foundations. Flush foundations\nand infill are not appropriate. Concrete block may be used only if covered with a veneer of brick or sand-finished stucco.\nLeave foundations under porches open wherever possible to promote air circulation to prevent rot and deterioration; use\nwood lattice or grilles to enclose.\n5) Wood grilles or lattice are appropriate infill if compatible with the period or style of the structure. Stock or lightweight\nwood lattice is not appropriate in areas in the public view.\n6) Existing unpainted historic foundations should not be painted. Previously painted foundations should be repainted an\nappropriate color, such as white or whitewash, dark green, or brick red. Avoid removing paint from a previously painted\nfoundation. (See Brickwork and Masonry standards).\n7) Locate new utilities and mechanical equipment such as package unit furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioning coils\nat the rear or other area not seen from public view. Utilities should never be located at the front of a structure or site. Provide\nscreening with plantings, fences, or paint treatments.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 9 CONTRIBUTING COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS.\n"}, {"page": "218", "text": "9.1 Contributing Commercial Buildings - Standards\n1) Retain and preserve historic commercial storefronts and building facades, including display windows, entrance\nconfigurations, doors, transoms, bulkheads, windows, cornices, parapets, and brickwork.\n2) Retain and preserve historic storefront and facade features through repair rather than wholesale replacement of old\nelements with new materials.\n3) Replace historic facade features in-kind using matching materials when original elements are too deteriorated to\nrepair. Replacement materials should match the original in design, dimension, texture, and color. Substitute materials are\nappropriate only when the original materials are not available or repairable. Samples of substitute materials shall be\nsubmitted and may be approved only on a case-by-case basis.\n4) To reconstruct missing or altered storefront features, design new facade details to be compatible with the subject\nbuilding and the surrounding historic buildings of the same period and style. Use historic forms, materials, colors, and\ndetails adapted from other historic commercial buildings in the district, including large display windows and transoms.\n5) Designs for missing storefronts or other facade details should not use historical themes or detailing that are not\nappropriate for the historical period of the subject building.\n6) Rehabilitate rear facades of commercial buildings to provide for attractive and convenient access from rear parking\nareas or the waterfront. Repair and preserve historic detailing on rear facades wherever possible. Make every effort to\nconsolidate and eliminate unnecessary utility lines, pipes, meters, mechanical units, etc., to improve the appearance of rear\nfacades.\n7) Signage for all storefronts should be compatible in scale, size, color, and design with the subject building and\nsurrounding historic commercial buildings.

The painting of certain\nmasonry surfaces may be appropriate if the surfaces have been patched or marred by damage over time, and if the visual\nintegrity of the surface has been compromised. Paint colors should reflect the base material where possible (for example,\ndamaged or patched brickwork should be painted a brick red color). This is also applicable to non-contributing buildings.\n4) New or replacement gutters and downspouts should have a baked-on enamel finish in a color that is appropriate for\nthe structure, or should be painted after installation.\n5) Old paint should not be removed by sand blasting or other abrasive or destructive methods.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005)\nSECTION 11 NEW CONSTRUCTION.\nIt is the intent of these regulations to assure that new construction, including additions to existing improvements, is\ncongruous with the special character of the district. In considering new construction, the Commission and/or the Planner\nshall direct design that it is harmonious with the character of the district.\nConsultation with the Swansboro Historic Preservation Commission in the early stages of a new construction project to\nbecome familiar with its procedures and aspects of design is recommended.\nMassing studies enable graphic analysis of the shape, form, size and building envelope of proposed new construction. The\nmassing study provides the applicant with a way to document the proposed building height and scale, and other elements of\nthe proposed construction as they relate to nearby existing buildings, especially in the block.\nMASSING STUDY\n1) Engage a state-licensed architect or engineer to prepare a massing study. This massing study shall include an existing\nconditions plan (including, but not limited to, showing topography, any significant trees, and utilities,) and a proposed\ncondition site plan. Plans shall be prepared with a scale of 1 inch = 20 feet or of a size easily reviewed by staff and the\nSwansboro Historic Commission.\nSITE PLACEMENT\n"}, {"page": "219", "text": "2) Maintain a similar front, side, and rear yard setback to other contributing and non- contributing buildings on the block\nand/or side of the street.\n3) Orient the building's front entrance similar to other contributing and non-contributing structures on the block and/or\nside of the street. Use architectural elements such as porches to define new entrances.\n4) Maintain the pattern of building separation and lot coverage that is found on the block and/or side of the street.\n5) Place outbuildings and accessory structures in rear yards. Avoid locations that obscure the principal building's\nprominent architectural features or significant site features.\n6) Make the proposed landscaping, groundcover, and any pavement treatment for the site compatible with surrounding\nproperties on the block and in the historic district.\n7) Minimize ground disturbance during new construction to avoid unnecessary damage to unknown archaeological\nresources.\nBUILDING HEIGHT/SCALE\n8) Maintain a building height that is consistent with the height of contributing buildings found on the block or side of the\nstreet. Residential buildings traditionally range from one to two and one-half stories in height, while commercial buildings\nrange in height from one to four stories.\n9) Make the scale (the relationship of a building's mass and details to a human being) of the proposed building\ncompatible with the scale of other contributing structures in the historic district. This relationship to building mass should\ninclude nearby buildings in the block and adjoining open space.\n10) Design the proportion (the ratio of height to width) of the proposed new building and its architectural elements to be\nconsistent with the proportion of contributing buildings and their associated architectural elements in the historic district.\n11) Use windows and doors in new construction that are compatible in proportion, shape, location, pattern, and size with\nwindows and doors of contributing buildings in the historic district.\nMATERIALS\n12) Keep the siding and trim material of the proposed building consistent with materials traditionally used on the\nimmediate block and in the historic district. This includes the physical elements of the building, such as stone or wood walls,\nbrick, fencing, landscaping mass, building facades and other elements, or combinations thereof.\n13) The use of synthetic products such as vinyl siding and other modern day products marketed to imitate traditional\nbuilding materials are permitted but not encouraged.\n14) Use materials in traditional ways. New materials should appear as if they were applied in a traditional manner so as to\nconvey the same visual appearance as historically used and applied building materials.\nDETAILS\n15) Use architectural details on the building that complement the architectural details of contributing structures on the\nblock and/or side of the street.\n16) Avoid exact replications of historic buildings and their architectural elements. Such efforts may provide a false sense\nof history by confusing the age of a \"new\" building.\n17) Provide a date brick or other exterior date identification marker on all new construction to assist future generations in\nthe dating of buildings.\nTEXTURE\n18) Create in new construction a similar degree of texture that is found in contributing buildings in the historic district.\nHowever, concentrate on the ability to blend rather than duplication. Texture is the relief on a building surface that is\nachieved through the use and interaction of a variety of building materials and shapes. Materials such as weatherboard\nsiding, decorative fish-scale shingles, and beaded board porch ceilings are examples of wooden architectural elements that\nhave different physical and visual qualities and contribute to the \"texture\" of a building surface.\n19) Use traditional building materials in traditional locations to achieve texture.\nCOLOR\n20) Choose exterior colors for new construction that will blend and work with the surrounding buildings and area.\nFORM AND RHYTHM\n21) Design new construction that reflects the basic shapes and forms found on the block and in the historic district.\n22) Maintain a consistency in roof shape between new construction and the contributing structures found on the block\nand/or side of the street. Roof forms commonly found in the historic district include gable varieties with an average pitch of\n7/12 or greater, hipped roofs in the residential areas, and flat roofed buildings in the late 19th and early 20th century\ncommercial downtown with storefront facades.\n"}, {"page": "220", "text": "23) Maintain similar percentages and patterns of window and door openings. Openings which vary considerably from the\nestablished patterns found on the block in which the new construction is placed will tend to have a disruptive effect on the\ndesired harmony of the streetscape.\n24) Create form and rhythm in new construction through the use of architectural elements and details. Study neighboring\nhistoric structures on the block to see if a consistent treatment of elements exists and emulate this pattern in the new\nconstruction. However, limit the amount in which one new building emulates a contributing building unless the building is a\nreproduction of an existing contributing building from the Town's Historic District. In which case, a key stone should be\nimbedded in the foundation to identify when the new building was built.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021; Am.

An addition should not be taller than the original structure\nunless required by code or a non-aesthetic functional requirement.\n3) The design elements of additions should be compatible with the existing building in terms of materials, style, color,\nroof forms, proportion and spacing of doors and windows, details, surface texture, and location. Contemporary adaptations\nof the original which clearly look like an addition and reflect the period of construction are encouraged. It is also appropriate\nto closely replicate the details and design elements of the existing structure.\n4) Additions should be constructed so that they can be removed from the original building in the future without irreparable\ndamage to significant features.\n5) Materials used for the roof, siding, trim, windows, and foundations should be similar to or compatible with the materials\nused in the construction of the existing building. Vinyl and other synthetic siding materials are not appropriate on additions\nto\nhistoric buildings unless the affected building is already covered with synthetic siding. Wood windows are most appropriate\nfor additions within the historic district; however, synthetic window materials are acceptable but not encouraged for additions\nprovided the proposed windows meet the requirements set forth in the Windows and Doors standards.\n6) Rooflines of additions should be similar in form, pitch, and leave height to the roofline of the original building.\n7) Foundations should be similar to or compatible with the existing foundations in material, color, detailing, and height.\n8) The siting or location of an addition should not have a negative impact on the character, significance, or other\nimportant features of a property or the district, such as plantings, outbuildings, open space, or vistas to the water or other\nbuildings.\n9) Preserve older additions or other alterations to existing buildings that have acquired significance over time when\nplanning and building a new addition. Existing additions and alterations that are at least 50 years old will be evaluated for\nsignificance as part of the review process.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am.

If replacement is necessary, use new material\nthat matches the historic material in composition, size, shape, color, pattern, and texture.\n4) Design new fences that are compatible with the associated building, site, and streetscape in height, proportion, scale,\ncolor, texture, material, and design. Synthetic fence materials, such as vinyl, are not appropriate in the historic district.\n5) Fences shall not exceed a height of four feet in front yards and other areas of primary visual concern. Fences at rear\nyards and other areas not readily seen from the public view may be up to six feet high. The transition between low front\nfences and higher rear fences should be made as far to the rear of the enclosed structure or yard as possible, and no more\nthan half the depth of the yard forward of the principal structure. Any fence that meets a structure should join the building at\nan architectural feature on the structure, such as a cornerboard, break, or other appropriate junction point.\n6) Historic retaining walls should be preserved. New low walls are appropriate only where a sharp change in grade exists,\nand shall not exceed a height of two feet. Such walls should be constructed of brick or concrete block covered with a true\nsand-finish stucco.\n7) The use of false historical details or other non-original architectural embellishments on existing fences is not\nappropriate.\n8)\nContemporary or utilitarian fence materials are not appropriate for fences in the public view. Inappropriate materials\ninclude: plastic, vinyl, chain link, wire, and all other modern materials. The use of modern fencing is permitted for rear yards\nonly, in areas not seen from the public view, using vinyl-coated chain link (dark green or black), standard chain link, or\nheavy wire (\"hog wire\"). Use plantings such as ivy, climbing roses, jasmine, or other vines to hide wire fences.\n9) Use a combination of fences and plantings to screen parking lots. To provide adequate visibility for drivers entering\nand leaving, the fence should not exceed a height of three (3) feet at the street/sidewalk edge.

Avoid damaging or obscuring architectural\nfeatures in the installation.\n5) Install shutters on windows if historically appropriate based on physical evidence or documentary photograph. Shutters\nshould be of wood and correspond proportionally in size to the window opening. Shutters should be mounted with\nappropriate hardware (i.e., pintles, hinges, and holdbacks) even if they are not operable.\n6) Locate utilities in side or rear yards and screen from public view with plantings, fencing, or other means.\n7) Locate vents, meter boxes, and other utility connections in areas not visible from public view. Avoid damaging\narchitectural features in the installations. Choose non-character-defining wall sections for such installation.\n8) Locate roof ventilators, antennas and satellite dishes in areas not visible from public view. Satellite dishes exceeding\n24\" in diameter shall not be installed in the historic district.\n9) Paint meter boxes, vents, and other utility fixtures in colors that will allow them to blend in with the historic/existing\nbuildings.\n10) Avoid drilling holes in historic wall surfaces to accommodate blown-in insulation. If wall insulation is desired, carefully\nremove pieces of exterior sheathing and run battens of insulation down the wall. Insulating the floor and ceiling areas is\npreferable since primary heat loss occurs in these areas.\n11) Avoid placing window air conditioning units on the front facade of the building.\n12) When installing utility fixtures - such as street lights, signal boxes, utility poles, or railroad crossings - in the public\nright-of-way, take into account the impact of the fixtures on the character of the streetscape and the historic district as a\nwhole. Utility fixtures will be evaluated in terms of location, design, color, scale, compatibility with surrounding streetscape\nfeatures, and the overall visual impact on the historic district.\n13) Avoid radically pruning street trees located under utility wires. Such pruning practices permanently damage the form\n"}, {"page": "222", "text": "and long-term health of the tree.

Use low masonry walls, fencing, or dense plantings in a minimum\nten foot wide buffer strip to soften the presence of the parking area in the landscape.\n5) Integrate pedestrian scale lighting into parking areas to avoid excessive glare and illumination to adjoining properties.\nSee Exterior Lighting standards, \u00a7 152.016, for further details on lighting standards.\n6) Incorporate existing mature trees into new parking areas. Avoid the placement of impervious surface materials such as\nasphalt and concrete in areas below the canopy crown of the tree. Use turf stone, gravel, marl, crushed shells, or other\npervious materials in these areas.\n7) Use paving materials that were traditionally used to surface parking areas and driveways in the historic district. Gravel,\nmarl, crushed shells, asphalt, and concrete are typical parking lot treatments, while grass, gravel or concrete runners with a\ngrassy median, brick, oyster shells, and marl are typical driveway treatments. Use bricks, stone, or metal to contain loose\npaving materials. Landscape timbers, railroad ties, and concrete or plastic edging are inappropriate.\n8) Construct new driveways to conform with the size, configuration, material, and location of existing driveways.\n9) Avoid placing driveways and parking pads in front yard areas and other prominent areas visible from the public view.\n10) Avoid abutting parking areas and driveways directly to a building.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 18 SIGNAGE.\n18.1 Signage - Standards\n1) Use a traditional palette of materials for new signs such as wood, metal, or stone. Synthetic materials are only\nappropriate when they resemble one of the materials listed above. Signage on commercial canvas lawnings and in storefront\ndisplay windows is also appropriate. Internal glass-mounted signs are not subject to SHPC review. However, the SHPC\nshall review interior neon signs that are located within five feet of a window or glass door on an exterior wall and are so\nplaced as to be seen from the outside. New exterior neon signs installed following the date of adoption of this amendment\nare prohibited.\n2) Place signs so they do not visually overwhelm the building or streetscape or damage or obscure character-defining\narchitectural details.\n3) Locate wall signs on commercial buildings with storefronts in the signboard frieze located above the display windows.\n"}, {"page": "223", "text": "In this location, the sign serves as a boundary between the lower and upper facade. See Section 9, Contributing\nCommercial Buildings, for information on storefront design.\n4) Use of neon or fluorescent colors on signs is prohibited. Sign colors must be consistent with the approved color\npalette.\n5) Use simple geometric shapes for new signs instead of more complex shapes that compete with the building, site, or\nstreetscape.\n6) Use simple, clear graphics and lettering styles in sign design.\n7) Use lettering that contrasts sharply with the background of the sign for easy reading. Lettering that is centered in the\nsign and contained within a border element is recommended.\n8) Use of flashing signs (including illumination of vending machines) is prohibited.\n9) Installation of billboards in the historic district is strictly prohibited. Refer to the Swansboro Unified Development\nOrdinance, \u00a7 152.016, for the definition of \"sign, billboard.\"\n10) Use free-standing signs that are low mounted and do not obscure pedestrian views. No more than one free-standing\nsign shall be allowed per street frontage. Free- standing sign pole supports should be simple and unobtrusive in design.\n11) Use contributing historic house plaques that conform to the established design used in the historic district. Consult\nwith the SHPC regarding standards for the placement of these plaques.\n12) Provide proper flashing for wall-mounted signs to prevent deterioration. Secure signs on masonry buildings in the\nmortar joint to prevent damage to the masonry surface.\n13) Consolidate public signage on uniform poles to reduce visual clutter.\n14) The placement of banners, pennants, and flags in the Historic District is prohibited unless related to a town-approved\nfestival or non-profit event.\n15) Recognize that maximum signage allowances granted by the Swansboro Unified Development Ordinance, $152.016,\nmay be inappropriate in the context of the building or site under review.\n16) Use of sandwich board signs in the historic district is permitted if:\n-- Size is no more than 2' X 3'.\n-- Location cannot impede pedestrian traffic along a public walkway.\n-- Blocks no exit or exitway.\n-- Removed at end of business day.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am.

Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 20 NEGLECT - \"PASSIVE CHANGE\".\nTown Code requires that all exterior changes to historic district properties be approved by the SHPC. By extension, when\nneglect (a \"passive\" change) threatens a property, the SHPC can seek remedial action.\nUsually the neighborhood initiates activity through a written request that the SHPC investigate conditions. If the SHPO\ndetermines demolition by neglect is taking place, it files a petition listing specific defects with the town Inspections\nDepartment. Inspections, as the town's enforcement body in zoning matters, may then issue a written complaint to the\nproperty owner outlining the defects. The department also arranges a formal hearing on the case, to establish evidence\nregarding the charge, and ascertain whether the owner wishes to claim economic hardship (the latter requires submitting\ndetailed financial information).\nIf Inspections rules demolition by neglect is underway, it can issue an order requiring the owner undertake repairs within a\n"}, {"page": "224", "text": "specified time, or else face mounting fines. As a last resort, the town may take legal action.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005)\nSECTION 21 RELOCATION OF BUILDINGS.\nRequests to move buildings, particularly contributing structures, are carefully evaluated by the Swansboro Historic\nPreservation Commission. Such requests should be considered only if demolition of the resource is eminent. Moving an\nhistoric building destroys the original setting of the structure and inevitably distorts the story of the town's historic\ndevelopment. A property included in the National Register of Historic Places may be delisted if it is moved. Moving a building\nalso often results in the loss of historic building material. Structures frequently must be partially disassembled to\neconomically accomplish the move or to avoid obstructions such as utility wires, trees, and other buildings along the moving\nroute.\nIf relocation is warranted, every effort should be made to move the building intact as a single unit. Careful planning should\nbe undertaken to relocate the structure to a lot that has similar characteristics to the original site. Vacant lots in the historic\ndistrict are the preferred location for newly moved historic resources. The SHPC will use its new construction standards\nwhen reviewing requests to move structures to lots within the historic district.\nApplications for a Certificate of Appropriateness for building relocation should include:\n1) a detailed description of the preparation work that will be necessary to move the structure;\n2) detailed photographs of the structure and building site, including significant vegetation;\n3) a site plan of the original site indicating the footprint of the structure and location of significant vegetation;\n4) the proposed route of the move;\n5) a map indicating trees along the route that will be affected by the move and how they will be impacted;\n6) agreements with the utility companies; and\n7) arrangements of notification with the Swansboro Police Department.\nAdditionally, the mover should file two acceptable letters of recommendation and post a bond, letter of credit, or other\nreasonable performance guarantee in an amount required by the Town of Swansboro to cover the costs of any damages to\npublic property resulting from the move.\n21.1 Relocation of Buildings - Guidelines\n1) Choose relocation only as a last resort to demolition.\n2) Document the original site thoroughly with drawings and black and white photographs prior to relocation.\n3) Hire reputable movers who have experience with historic properties.\n4) Move the building as a single unit in lieu of partial or complete disassembly, if possible.\n5)\nPlan the relocation route carefully. Choose a route that requires minimal tree and utility disturbance.\n6) Secure all necessary permits and approvals prior to beginning the move.\n7) Secure the building to be moved to minimize damage during the move and to prevent vandalism.\n8) Choose a site for the relocated structure that is similar to the original site, if possible. The site should correspond\nproportionally to the size of the structure. A site in the historic district is preferred.\n9) Position the building on the new site so it relates to adjacent buildings and the overall streetscape. Refer to New\nConstruction guidelines for further information on placement.\n10) Maintain any existing mature vegetation on the new site, if possible. This will help create an established building site\ncontext for the new structure.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 22 DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS.\nDemolition of a contributing building in the Swansboro historic district is strongly discouraged. This irreversible action\nresults in the permanent loss of the resource and may have an adverse effect on surrounding contributing properties and\nthe character of the historic district as a whole. Property owners contemplating demolition of a building are encouraged to\nexplore alternatives which allow the property to remain intact and meet current needs. Early consultation with the SHPC is\nstrongly recommended in order to adequately explore options.\nIn reviewing requests for demolition, both the property owner and the SHPC should carefully consider the following\nquestions:\n1) Does the contributing building retain integrity and contribute to the special character of the Swansboro Historic District\n"}, {"page": "225", "text": "because of its age, architecture, or association with events or individuals who are important to the history of the town?\n2) Does the contributing building possess structural integrity so rehabilitation is feasible?\n3) Can the contributing building be creatively adapted to meet the owner's needs? If so, can this be accomplished at a\nprice that is less than or comparable to new construction costs? Remember to factor in demolition costs and landfill tipping\nfees when developing cost estimates.\n4) Are there alternative sites on which no contributing buildings are extant that might be available to accomplish the\nproject? If so, are there possible buyers for the contributing building in question?\n5) What will be the impact of the contributing building's demolition on surrounding properties and the historic district as a\nwhole?\n6) If all other possible options are exhausted, can the contributing building be moved to another location in the historic\ndistrict?\n7) If the building is non-contributing, 1-6 does not apply.\n22.1 Demolition of Buildings - Standards\n1) Work with the Swansboro Historic Preservation Commission to identify alternatives to demolition.\n2) Make a permanent record of the contributing building before demolition. Documentation should include black and\nwhite photographs of the property - views of principal elevations, notable architectural details, and significant site features\nsuch as outbuildings, fencing, and mature vegetation. Measured drawings of the building may be required by the SHPC if\nthe structure is of particular significance. These determinations shall be made on a case-by-case basis by the SHPC.\n3) Salvage architectural features and building materials for reuse or study. Contact antique dealers and used building\nsupply establishments to arrange for removal. Consider donations of items to interested non-profit organizations or\nmuseums or the NC-SHOO.\n4) Minimize ground-disturbing activities during demolition to avoid damage to potential unknown archaeological\nresources.\n5) Retain mature vegetation on site, if possible or relocate. Prior to any tree more than 20 feet in height or 20 feet spread\nor mature being cut down, SHPC shall give approval under Major Work.\n6) Clean the site thoroughly of all building debris and leave the lot properly graded and seeded.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 5-24-2021)\nSECTION 23 ACCESSIBILITY AND LIFE SAFETY.\nMeeting contemporary accessibility and life safety standards at historic properties is one of the greatest design challenges\nfacing owners of these properties. Extreme care must be taken to provide the desired level of safety and accessibility\nwithout compromising or destroying features that contribute to the building's significance.\nSubstantial rehabilitations and adaptive reuse of historic properties result in requirements to bring the structures into\ncompliance with applicable building codes governing life safety and accessibility. In 1994, the North Carolina State Building\nCode Council adopted provisions pertaining to existing buildings aimed at providing greater flexibility in the administration of\ncode requirements on older buildings. Under Volume IX of the North Carolina State Building Code, commercial structures\nwill essentially be evaluated based on the building code that was in place at the time of the building's construction. These\nprovisions, in most cases, should help to make historic buildings more adaptable to new uses and eliminate the necessity of\ncompromising architectural features and significant building spaces in the name of code compliance. It should be noted that\nVolume IX is optional. The SHPC recommends consulting with the town's Administrator to determine if these code\nprovisions best meet the project needs.\nThe federal American with Disabilities Act (ADA), signed into law in 1990, also impacts historic properties. This important\npiece of civil rights legislation is separate from the building code, yet includes provisions to eliminate physical barriers to\n\"places of public accommodation for the disabled.\" Religious organizations, private clubs, and private residences are not\nincluded in the legislation. Compliance deadlines are in place for state and local government-owned buildings and for newly\nconstructed public and commercial buildings. Alterations to existing buildings must also be undertaken in a manner that\nensures accessibility. Physical barriers in existing places of public accommodation must be removed when it is \"readily\nachievable\" to do SO.\nCompliance evaluations will be undertaken by the U.S. Justice Department when complaints arise.\nThe Swansboro Historic Preservation Commission bases its review of proposed accessibility and life safety alterations on\nthe impact these changes will have on the architectural and historic character of the resource. Design solutions that achieve\nthe least impact on the historic resource are encouraged. Efforts should be made to site wheelchair ramps, chair lifts, fire\nstairs, fire doors, and other alterations in the least visually obtrusive location. Such alterations should also be viewed as\nreversible and be constructed in such a manner that they could easily be removed from the resource without causing\npermanent or irreversible damage.\n23.1 Accessibility and Life Safety - Standards\n"}, {"page": "226", "text": "1) Choose uses for contributing buildings that allow for feasible compliance with applicable building code and\naccessibility requirements to ensure the protection of the building's historic and architectural character.\n2) Review proposed new uses for existing contributing buildings to determine the impact accessibility and life safety code\nrequirements on the historic resource. Explore a variety of design alternatives to achieve compliance and choose the one\nthat requires the least amount of alteration to the historic resource and site.\n3) Locate fire exits, stairs, landings, ramps, and chair lifts in side and rear yard areas, if possible.\n4) Design new exits, stairs, landings, and ramps so that they are compatible with the character of the building or site. For\nexample, wheelchair ramps may replicate a railing detail on a building or be of a simple design that allows it to blend\ndiscreetly with its surroundings. Such elements should be painted to tie in with the surrounding structure.\n5) Construct wheelchair ramps and chair lifts that are portable or temporary and do not permanently damage, obscure, or\nrequire the removal of character-defining architectural features. Such alterations should be reversible in nature to maintain\nthe integrity of the historic resource.\n(Ord. 2005-03, passed 3-15-2005; Am.
