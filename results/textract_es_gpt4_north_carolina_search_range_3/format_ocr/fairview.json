These districts are created to accomplish the purposes and serve the\nobjectives set forth in the remainder of this section.\n(b)\nThe B-1 (central business) district is designed to accommodate a wide variety of\ncommercial activities that will result in the most intensive and attractive use of the\ncentral business district.\n(c)\nThe B-2 (community business) district is designed to accommodate commercial\ndevelopment on a scale that is less intensive than that permitted in a B-1 district.\nA lesser intensity of development is achieved through setback, height, and\nminimum lot size requirements that are more restrictive than those applicable to\nthe B-1 zone. The B-2 thus may provide a transition in some areas between a\nB-1 zone and a residential zone or may allow for smaller scale commercial\ndevelopment in rural areas, particularly at crossroads or other high traffic areas\nthat are not generally suited for residential development.\n(d)\nThe B-3 (office) district is designed to accommodate a mixture of office, clerical,\nresearch, and services uses. It is intended that this zoning classification be applied\nprimarily in areas that no longer are viable as single family residential areas\n118\n"}, {"page": "128", "text": "because of high traffic volumes on adjacent streets or because of other market\nfactors but remain viable as locations for offices and services. Such areas will also\ngenerally constitute transition or buffer zones between major arterials or more\nintensively developed commercial areas and residential districts.\n(e)\nThe B-4 (general commercial) district is designed to accommodate the widest\nrange of commercial activities.\n(f)\nThe HC (highway corridor mixed use) district is Intended to accommodate a wide\nvariety of commercial and light industrial uses along major transportation corridors,\nsubject to performance standards designed to (i) ensure the viability of the highway\nas a carrier of high volumes of traffic, (ii) recognize and preserve the value of land\nalong the corridor as the site of significant non-residential development, and (iii)\nprotect the viability of residential neighborhoods adjacent to the corridor. It is\nintended that developments that occur within this district in particular be sensitive to\nthe need to preserve a high degree of aesthetic appeal along major transportation\ncorridors.\n(g)\nThe B-6 (college campus) district is intended to accommodate a variety of\nresidential and non-residential uses developed on land owned by an institution of\nhigher learning and associated with that institution, such as dormitories, offices,\nclassroom buildings, athletic facilities, etc.\n(h)\nThe O (office district) is to provide areas which are Conducive to the\nestablishment and operation of offices, institutions, and commercial activities not\ninvolving the sale of merchandise. Standards are designed so that this district, in\nsome instances, may serve as transitional use between residential districts and\nother commercial districts.\nSection 137 Manufacturing Districts Established.\n(a)\nThe LI (light industrial) district is hereby established primarily to accommodate\nenterprises engaged in the manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning, or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment.\nThis district is distinguished in that certain types of industrial uses that tend to have\nsignificant adverse impacts on surrounding properties are excluded from the LI\ndistrict.\n(b)\nThere is also established a planned industrial development (PID) zoning district.\nThe purpose of this district is to provide for the possibility of well-planned and large-\nscale industrial development in otherwise undeveloped areas that have not\npreviously been zoned for industrial use. The district is thus a \"floating zone,\" i.e., it\nis not applied to particular property except in response to a petition submitted by or\non behalf of the owner or owners of all of the property intended to be covered by\nsuch zone. The district is subject to the following requirements:\n119\n"}, {"page": "129", "text": "(1)\nThe area to be zoned PID must be at least fifty contiguous acres in size and\nhave at least 100 feet of frontage along a major arterial (See subsection\n210(b)(7)).\n(2)\nA planned industrial development is the only permissible use in a PID zoning\ndistrict.\n(3)\nSubject to subsection (2) of this subsection, and consistent with the\nrestrictions contained in the definition of a planned industrial development\n(see section 15), land within a PID zone may be used in a manner that\nwould be permissible if the land were zoned LI, except that the only\npermissible uses are (i) wholesale sales and (ii) manufacturing, processing,\ncreating, repairing, renovating, painting, cleaning, assembling of goods,\nmerchandise and equipment as long as all operations are conducted entirely\nwithin a fully enclosed building.\nSection 138 Reserved.\nSection 139 Floodplain and Floodway Overlay Districts.\nThe floodplain (FP) and floodway (FW) overlay districts are hereby established.\nThe land so classified may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying district only if\nand to the extent such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district.

In order to protect an investment in new trees, the developer\nand his or her agents should follow these guidelines when planting:\n(1)\nThe best times for planting is early spring and early fall. Trees planted in the\nsummer run the risk of dehydration.\n(2)\nPlant all trees at least three-and-a-half feet from the end of head-in parking spaces\nin order to prevent damage from car overhangs.\n(3)\nDig the tree pit at least one foot wider than the root ball and at least six inches\ndeeper than the ball's vertical dimension.\n(4)\nEspecially in areas where construction activity has compacted the soil, the bottom\nof the pit should be scarified or loosened with a pick ax or shovel.\n(5)\nAfter the pit is dug, observe sub-surface drainage conditions. Most soils in the area\nare poorly drained. Where poor drainage exists, the tree pit should be dug at\nleast an additional twelve inches and the bottom should be filled with coarse\ngravel.\n(6)\nBackfill should include a proper mix of soil, peat moss and nutrients. All roots must\nbe completely covered. Backfill should be thoroughly watered as it is placed around\nthe roots.\n(7)\nImmediately after it is planted, the tree should be supported with stakes and guy\nwires to firmly hold it in place as its root system begins to develop. Staked trees\nwill become stronger more quickly. Remove stakes and ties after one year.\n(8)\nSpread at least three inches of mulch over the entire excavation in order to retain\nmoisture and keep down weeds. An additional three-inch saucer of mulch should\nbe provided to form a basin around the trunk of the tree. This saucer helps catch\nand retain moisture.\n(9)\nThe lower trunks of new trees should be wrapped with burlap or paper to prevent\nevaporation and sunscald. The wrapping should remain on the tree for at least\na\nyear.\n(10)\nConscientious post-planting care, especially watering, pruning and fertilizing, is a\nmust for street and parking lot trees. Branches of new trees may be reduced by as\nmuch as a third to prevent excessive evaporation.\n310\n"}, {"page": "320", "text": "Small trees planted\n30' on center.

When selecting new plantings for a particular site, a developer should\nfirst consider the types of plants which are thriving on or near that site. Accordingly,\nnative North Carolina species should often be favored. However, if an introduced species\nhas proven highly effective for screening or shading in piedmont towns, it too may be a\nproper selection.

Selections marked with an (*) are also recommended as\nshade trees and may be credited for meeting the 20% shading requirement for paved\nparking lots.\nRIVER BIRCH (Betula nigra) Height:20-40'; Spread: 8-16'.\nThe River Birch is a native tree which usually grows along stream banks. In\nlandscape design, it is adaptable to either high or low locations, but still requires a lot of\nmoisture. This tree has an interesting, papery bark and a graceful branching habit. It has\nno special pest or maintenance problems.\n*AMERICAN HORNBEAM (Carpinus Carolina) Height:20-30'; Spread:12-25'.\nThis native tree has a natural yet refined appearance. It is slow growing, but at\nmaturity it serves as an excellent small shade tree. Its fluted, \"muscular\" trunk is an\ninteresting feature.

The Redbud has some\npests, and its fruit pods may present a litter problem, but it recommends itself for being\ndrought resistant and tolerant of polluted city air.\n*FLOWERING DOGWOOD (Cornus Florida) Height: 15-30'; Spread: 15-20'.\nThe Dogwood is a native woodland tree which is very popular for landscape\nplanting. It is considered to be a fairly hardy tree, but, when planted in direct sun, it must\nbe frequently watered. A healthy Dogwood will develop attractive horizontal branches\nand a bushy crown. Dogwoods look best when planted in groups or when used as an\naccent in borders. These trees should be guarded against borers and other pests.\nWASHINGTON HAWTHORN (Crataegus phaenophyrum) Height: 5-30'; Spread:\n25-30'.\nHawthorns generally require spraying to prevent disease and insect infestation.\nHowever, they are an excellent choice for screening because of their extremely dense and\nthorny branches. They have proved to be excellent as a\nheadlight\nscreen\non\nhighway medians and, when planted close together, they form an impenetrable living\nfence. They prefer sun and are tolerant of most types of soil. The Washington Hawthorn\nis generally considered to be the best of the Hawthorns.\nRUSSIAN OLIVE (Elaegnus augustifolia) Height:15-20' Spread: 20-30'.\nThe Russian Olive can withstand severe exposure and will grow in almost any soil.\nIts toughness and wide spreading habit make it an exceptional screening plant. The\nfoliage is an attractive silver-gray color and its flowers, though inconspicuous, are very\nfragrant. The Russian Olive is especially notable for its rapid growth. It has no pest\nproblems but it may require periodic trimming of dead twigs.\nMOUNTAIN SILVERBELL(Halesia monticola) Height: 20-40'; Spread: 20'.\nSilverbells are attractive multi-stem trees which are native to the southeastern\nUnited States. They are excellent plants for a natural effect and are best placed where\ntheir small flowers and pods will be closely observed. Compared to other trees on this\nlist, its crown is more open and irregular.

It grows best in full sun and prefers moist yet well-drained soils.\n316\n"}, {"page": "326", "text": "If the lower limbs are allowed to grow naturally, they will branch to the ground. Hollies\nshould be protected from high winds. The American Holly is a relatively slow grower.\nGOLDEN RAIN TREE (Koelreuteria paniculata) Height: 20-30'; Spread: 15-20'.\nThis is an extremely hardy tree, tolerant of city conditions, drought resistant, and\ncapable of growth in most kinds of soil. It bears beautiful yellow flowers and interesting\nseedpods on its rounded crown. The Golden Rain Tree is a rapid grower but is relatively\nshort-lived.\nCRAPE MYRTLE (Lagerstroemia indica) Height: 15-25'; Spread: 15-20'.\nThis popular flowering tree is decorative and interesting in all seasons. However, it\nshould not be expected to stand alone as a screen. It is most effective against an\nevergreen background. It grows best in direct sun and may develop mildew problems\nwhen planted in shade. Crape Myrtle may be pruned to a desired shape, but when left on\nits own it will form a densely branching crown.\nSOURWOOD (Oxyndrum arboreum) Height: 20-30'; Spread: 10-15'.\nSourwoods are handsome native trees which are most effective in landscape\ndesign when planted in groups. They are easy to transplant and as each tree matures it\nassumes a slender form with upright branches.

It may be trimmed as a hedge,\nbut also serves as an excellent screen in its natural form. The Cherry-Laurel grows\nrapidly and has no pests. However, it may not be as cold hardy as other trees on this list.\n*CALLERY PEAR (Pyrus calleryana) Height: 20-40'; Spread: 20-30'.\nThe Callery Pear has recently gained popularity as a city street tree because it is\nimpervious to air pollution. Furthermore, it will grow in relatively infertile soils. It is a\nbeautiful, upright tree which grows rapidly and is long lived. However, it may be subject\nto an assortment of pests and diseases. The \"Bradford\" variety is recommended for its\nvigorous habit of growth.\nE-12.Large Trees for Evergreen Screening\nThe following trees are ideal for screening large-scale areas such as shopping\ncenters and industrial sites. They are also effective in combination with other, smaller\nscreening plants. All three are moderate to fast growers. They are not considered to be\nshade trees.\nDEODAR CEDAR (Cedrus deodara) Height: 40-150'; Spread: 30'+.\n317\n"}, {"page": "327", "text": "The Deodar Cedar is a useful and attractive evergreen. It should be allowed\nplenty of room in order to assume its beautiful natural form. Its pendulous branches\nshould be allowed to touch the ground. It prefers relatively dry soils, grows rapidly, and is\neasy to maintain. \"True Cedars\" such as the Deodar are not native to North America, but\nthey have become quite popular in the South as a landscape tree.\nSOUTHERN MAGNOLIA (Magnolia grandiflora) Height: 40-60'; Spread: 25'+.\nMagnolias are striking trees which serve well as screens when their branches are\nallowed to grow to the ground. Generally, this tree does well in city conditions, but it\nshould be planted in quite rich acidic soils and it requires a lot of moisture. Furthermore,\nMagnolias require ample space for growth. If planted in full sunlight, they will grow\nrapidly. Because it drops large waxy leaves, seedpods, and flowers, the Magnolias may\npresent a litter problem.\nCAROLINA HEMLOCK (Tsuga caroliniana) Height: 30-70'; Spread: 20'+.\nThis native of rocky locations in the North Carolina mountains adapts well to city\nlocations. It may be sheared or pruned to any shape, but when it grows naturally, its\ngraceful branches form an excellent high screen. The Hemlock prefers cooler, partially\nshaded locations and does best in highly fertile soils. It grows quite rapidly.\nE-13.Large Trees for Shading\nThe following trees may be used for screening, but they are recommended\nespecially for shading trees and parking lots. Unless otherwise noted, they will grow\nrapidly. Each species will attain a mature spread of at least thirty feet.\nNORWAY MAPLE (Acer platanoides) Height: 40-50'; Spread: 50'+\nMaples as a group are not particularly tolerant to city conditions. The Norway\nMaple is an exception, however, as it is relatively invulnerable to air pollution and has no\nspecial maintenance requirements. This tree assumes a wide spreading form and\nprovides very dense shade. In the autumn, the leaves are a brilliant red and yellow. The\nNorway Maple grows rapidly, but it is subject to ice and wind damage. Plenty of room\nshould be available for its shallow roots and it should be given ample water.\nRED MAPLE (Acer rubrum) Height: 40-50'; Spread: 25'+\nThis tree is an example of a Maple which is not recommended where there will be\nhigh concentrations of air pollution. However, with its excellent shading characteristics\nand beautiful colors, it should not be ignored. This tree grows rapidly, but, unlike the\nNorway Maple, it does not become brittle with age. The Red Maple is a native tree which\nis usually found in moist, even swampy areas, but it adapts well to a variety of situations.\nAlthough subject to Maple insects and diseases, it is usually a long-lived tree.\nGINKGO or MAIDENHAIR TREE (Ginkgo biloba) Height: 40-80'; Spread: 30'+.\n318\n"}, {"page": "328", "text": "The Ginkgo is a tree which is recommended for several outstanding reasons. It is\none of the oldest surviving species of trees. It is adaptable to any soil, climate, or degree\nof exposure to the sun. It does quite well in the city. It has no pests, no diseases, and no\npruning requirements. In sum, it is a tree of exceptional vitality. The N. C. Department of\nForest Resources calls the Ginkgo, \"probably the best all around street tree.\" Two\nreservations are worth stating, however. First, only male trees should be planted because\nfemale Ginkgos bear a messy, malodorous fruit. Second, the Ginkgo is a slow grower.\nWhen young, it has a rather gangly appearance. It takes 25 to 30 years to assume\nits\nmature, symmetrically spreading form.\nHONEYLOCUST (Gleditisia triacanthos) Height: 50-75'; Spread: 25'+\nIts open, spreading form and feathery leaves may give the Honeylocust a frail\nappearance, but it is in fact a quite sturdy tree, notable for its resistance to city conditions.\nGrass and shrubs thrive beneath a Honeylocust because it casts light shade. This tree is\nespecially useful for its ability to be transplanted at a relatively advanced age. Accordingly,\nit may be used for immediate effect in a landscape design. The Honeylocust has its own\npests and diseases, but it is fairly hardy. Thornless and\nfruitless varieties such as\n\"Moraine\" are recommended.\nSWEET GUM (Liquidamber styraciflua) Height: 60-100'; Spread: 50'+.\nThe Sweet Gum is a native bottomland tree which adapts to a variety of soils. Its\ndense foliage and balanced form make it an excellent shade tree for large open areas.\nThe Sweet Gum needs sun and plenty of room to achieve maximum size and beauty. In\nthe fall, its leaves turn a brilliant wine and gold color. Other than clean up of its prickly\nseed balls, the Sweet Gum poses no special maintenance problems.\nLONDON PLANE-TREE (Platanus acerifolia) Height: 70-100'; Spread: 30'+.\nThe London Plane-Tree is excellent for streets and parking lots for a variety of\nreasons. It puts out its branches high enough above the ground so as not to obstruct\ntraffic. Its broadly spreading crown makes it especially useful along wide streets. The\nLondon Plane is one of the world's hardiest trees in polluted air. Although it needs plenty\nof sun and moisture, it is undemanding about soil. Finally, it is very long lived. The\nLondon Plane-Tree is a hybrid of the Sycamore, and like the Sycamore, it may suffer from\ncertain diseases. However, it is more resistant to leaf blight than the Sycamore.\nSYCAMORE (Platanus occidentalis) Height: 70-100'; Spread: 60'+.\nThe Sycamore is probably the fastest growing shade tree on this list. Within ten\nyears, it can grow to a height of between thirty and forty feet. It is easily transplanted, but\nit needs plenty of space. As one of nature's most massive trees, Sycamores have been\nknown to grow to a height of 170 feet with a trunk 10 feet across. The Sycamore is a\nnative tree which typically grows in flood plains, but it thrives in a variety of situations. Its\ntolerance of severe conditions has long made it a favorite choice as a street tree.\nSycamores are susceptible to fungi and leaf blight and their large leaves and seed balls\nmay present a litter problem.\n319\n"}, {"page": "329", "text": "EASTERN RED OAK (Quercus rubra) Height: 50-70'; Spread: 40'+.\nThis tree grows faster than any other oak, two feet or more per year. It is prized\nas a tree because its high branching habit gives it an ideal shape. The Red Oak grows in\nalmost any average soil and presents no special maintenance problems.\nWILLOW OAK (Quercus phellos) Height: 60-80'; Spread: 30'+.\nThis is another rapidly growing Oak. It has proven to be quite successful as a\nstreet and parking lot tree. Its slender leaves give it a finer texture than that of other\nOaks, but it still casts excellent shade. The Willow Oak is native to bottomland soils, and\nthus it needs plenty of moisture. It often spreads majestically as it matures so it should be\ngiven ample room to grow. No significant pests or diseases afflict the Willow Oak.\nSCARLET OAK (Quercus coccinea) Height: 60-80'; Spread: 40'+.\nThis is a third Oak which grows rapidly and is easy to maintain. The Scarlet Oak\nis\nmore difficult to transplant than the Red or the Willow, but it may be a worthwhile\nselection for its excellent foliage.\nLAUREL OAK (Quercus laurifolia) Height: 40-60'; Spread: 30'+.\nThe Laurel Oak grows more slowly than the other Oaks listed above, but it has the\nadvantage of being nearly evergreen in piedmont sections of North Carolina. It has\nproven to be a good street tree and does quite well under city conditions. It presents no\nspecial maintenance problems.\nLITTLELEAF LINDEN (Tilia cordata) Height: 30-50'; Spread: 25'+.\nLindens are notable for their exceptional symmetry and their ability to grow in poor\nsoils. The Littleleaf Linden requires plenty of moisture, but it has proven to be useful for\ncity planting and is especially recommended as a street tree. With its many thick\nbranches and abundant foliage, the Linden provides very dense shade. It should be\nsprayed for aphids in order to prevent sticky droppings from the leaves.\nE-14 Small Shrubs for Evergreen Screening\nThe following shrubs are recommended for informal (unclipped) hedges or screens.\nEach species grows to a height of less than six feet; therefore, these shrubs are\nappropriate for Semi-opaque Screens.\nGLOSSY ABELIA (Abelia grandiflora) Height: 4-6'; Spread: 3-5'.\nAbelia is quite common in local nurseries and tends to be less expensive than\nother shrubs on this list. It bears pale pink flowers throughout the summer. Although it\nhas proven quite popular for informal hedges, it has several drawbacks. Abelia should\nbe pruned and thinned to maintain its best form. It may drop its leaves due to low\ntemperatures, lack of pruning, or starvation.\n320\n"}, {"page": "330", "text": "WARTY BARBERRY (Barberis verruculosa) Height: 3-4'; Spread: 3-4'.\nBarberrys as a group have proven to be excellent as hedge plants. With their\ndense, spiny limbs, they are effective barriers in public places. The Warty Barberry is a\nshrub with a neat, compact habit. It is soil tolerant and has no special maintenance\nrequirements. It grows slowly, but it will reach a height of 3 to 4 feet within five years.\nWINTERGREEN BARBERRY (Berberis julianae) Height: 4-6'; Spread: 2-5'.\nThis is another Barberry which forms an impenetrable thorny hedge. In fact, it\ngrows even more densely than the Warty Barberry. It is pest resistant and is very hardy.\nNo pruning is required. Because it is fairly slow growing, it will take eight to ten years to\nreach a height of 5 to 6 feet.\nDWARF HORNED HOLLY (llex cornuta 'rotunda') Height: 3'; Spread: 3-4'.\nThis shrub is an excellent selection for a low hedge. It is soil tolerant and requires\nno pruning or other special care once established. With its spiny leaves, this plant\nappears to be and is in fact rugged. Like all Hollies, it grows best in full sun, but unlike\nothers of its species, it produces bright red berries without both sexes being present.\nLITTLELEAF JAPANESE HOLLY (llex crenata 'microphylla') Height: 4-6'; Spread:\n5-7'.\nThis Holly is a good substitute for the more finicky and often more expensive\nBoxwood. It withstands pruning, but is quite attractive in its natural form. Although\nconsidered to be slow growing, it will form a stiff 6-feet tall hedge within ten years. The\nLittleleaf Japanese Holly grows well in both sun and shade and does well in city\nconditions.\nCONVEXA JAPANESE HOLLY (llex crenata 'convexa') Height: 4-6'; Spread: 3-5'.\nThe Convexa Japanese Holly is another good Boxwood substitute. This shrub is\nconsidered to be one of the most attractive, hardy and serviceable Hollies for landscape\nuse. It is attractive in either a clipped or unclipped form. It grows faster than the\nLittleleaf Japanese Holly.\nINDIA HAWTHORN (Raphiolepis indica) Height: 3-4'; Spread: 4-5'.\nWith its spreading, irregularly branching, the India Hawthorn makes an excellent\ninformal hedge. It is tolerant of a variety of soils and is fairly drought resistant. However,\nit may not be as cold tolerant and pest resistant as other shrubs on this list.\nAZALEAS and RHODODENDRONS (Rhododendron species) Height: 3'+; Spread:\n3'+.\nMany varieties of Azaleas and Rhododendrons are dense and evergreen and\nare, therefore, good screening material. The universal popularity of this large shrub\nfamily belies the fact that its members must not be planted indiscriminately. As a\n321\n"}, {"page": "331", "text": "group, Rhododendron species prefer cool, moist, well-drained, acidic soil which has a\nfairly high organic content. They do best in shade or partial shade particularly when they\nare planted in extremely hot or windy locations. If planted in full sun, they should\nreceive plenty of water. In spite of these requirements, once established in good soil\nwith the correct culture and water, both Rhododendrons and Azaleas tend to take care\nof themselves. Some relatively hardy and vigorous species are: Kurume Azaleas (R.\nobtusum), Snow Azaleas (R. mucronatum), Indian Azaleas (R. indicum), and the\nnative Carolina\nRhododendron (R. carolinianum).\nJAPANESE YEW (Taxus cuspidata) Height: 4-6'; Spread: 5-7'\nThe versatile Yew is commonly available from local nurseries in a wide variety of\nsizes and shapes. The Japanese Yew serves as excellent screening material in either a\nclipped or unclipped form. It tolerates poor growing conditions and flourishes in almost\nany kind of soil. (Soggy soil may hamper its growth, however.) It is comparatively pest\nfree and is hardy under trying winter conditions. The Yew's best feature is its rich shiny\ngreen needles which grow densely on all varieties.\nE-15. Large Shrubs For Evergreen Screening\nThe following shrubs are recommended for high hedges or screens. Each species\ngrows to a height of more than 6 feet; therefore, these shrubs are appropriate for Opaque\nScreens.\nTHORNY ELAENGUS (Elaengus pungens) Height: 8-10'; Spread: 6-10'.\nThis shrub is tolerant of many adverse conditions. It will grow rapidly in relatively\ninfertile, dry soils. Its dense thorny branches form an excellent natural hedge. It is one of\nthe most common evergreen shrubs in the south.\nBURFORD HOLLY(Ilex cornuta 'Burfordii') Height: 8-15'; Spread: 6-8'.\nThe Burford Holly has been called, \"one of the best and most serviceable of all\nbroad leafed evergreens for general planting in the South.\" It is soil tolerant, grows\nrapidly, requires no pruning, and usually has no pest problems. Its dark green leaves lack\nthe usual Holly spines.\nYAUPON HOLLY (llex vomitoria) Height: 5-15'; Spread: 6-12'.\nThis is another versatile Holly, slower growing than the Burford, but equally as\nadaptable to adverse conditions. It is a native shrub which has proven to be one of the\nmost drought resistant of all Hollies. It may be clipped to maintain any desired height.\nThe Yaupon Holly is very heavily fruited and will attract birds.\nLAUREL or SWEET BAY (Lauris nobilis) Height: 10-12'; Spread: 8-10'.\nLaurel is a tough low maintenance shrub which does best in fertile, well-drained\nsoils. Pruning is not required but it may be sheared to any desired form. It screens well\n322\n"}, {"page": "332", "text": "with a single row planting.

Accordingly, it is one of the most popular hedge\nplants in America. This and other Ligustrums are fast growing and remarkably pest free.\nThey are ideal as a high screen in large-scale areas. It has been said that if a Ligustrum\nwill not grow in a particular location, then nothing will.\nFORTUNE TEA OLIVE (Osmanthus fortunei) Height: 9-12'; Spread: 5-7'.\nThis Osmanthus hybrid is a popular, though non-descript, shrub. With its vigorous\ngrowth, it will form an excellent screen or border. It is soil tolerant. The Fortune Tea Olive\nis most notable for its inconspicuous yet highly fragrant flowers.\nRED PHOTINIA (Photinia glabra) Height: 6-10'; Spread: 4-5'.\nThis low maintenance shrub is often selected for its glossy saw toothed leaves\nwhich are a bright red when they first appear. Photinia forms a good hedge when\nplanted in full sun. It has somewhat looser foliage than other plants on this list. In recent\nyears, Red Photinia has become very popular in the Southeast.\nLAURESTINUS VIBURNUM (Viburnum tinus) Height: 10-12'; Spread: 10-12'.\nThis Viburnum is prized for its luxuriant dark green foliage. It is valuable for\nscreens and, though sometimes clipped as a formal hedge, it can remain uncut for years\nand still keep its good form. It grows best in medium fertile soils and prefers dry conditions\nin the late summer. All Viburnums withstand city conditions well.\nE-16 Assorted Shrubs for Broken Screens\nThe following is a sampling of shrubbery which would be appropriate in a Broken\nScreen. Because many of these plants are deciduous, they are not suitable for Opaque\nand Semi-Opaque Screens. (Note: Many of the evergreen shrubs described in planting\nlist E-14 and E-15, are also suitable for Broken Screens.)\nJAPANESE BARBERRY (Barberis thunbergii) Height: 3-5'; Spread: 3-5'.\nThis extremely common deciduous shrub is considered to be one of the toughest\nmembers of the Barberry family. It survives drought, poor soils, exposure, and the worst\ncity conditions. With its many thorns, the Japanese Barberry is often used as an\nimpenetrable barrier, but is attractive enough to stand alone as a specimen plant. It\nrequires no special maintenance and, when planted singly, needs no pruning.\nFRINGETREE (Chioanthus virginicus) Height: 10-30'; Spread: 8-10'.\nThe Fringetree is known for its profusion of beautiful flowers. It is considered to be\none of the most striking native American shrubs. It is relatively difficult to transplant, but\n323\n"}, {"page": "333", "text": "once established it does well in cities as it endures heavy smoke and dust. The mature\nFringetree's only drawback is that its leaves appear rather late in the Spring.\nBORDER FORSYTHIA (Forsythia intermedia) Height: 8-10'; Spread: 7-10'.\nForsythias are well known shrubs which bloom bright yellow quite early in the\nSpring. There are two commonly available forms of this shrub: the weeping Forsythia\nsuspensa and the more upright Forsythia intermedia. The latter is preferred for screening\npurposes. With its graceful branches, the Border Forsythia presents a good deciduous\nfoliage mass and should be given plenty of room to grow. It transplants easily and\nwithstands poor growing conditions. It should be thinned occasionally to ensure vigorous\ngrowth.\nVERNAL WITCH HAZEL(Hamamelis vernalis) Height: 4-6'; Spread: 2-3'.\nThis rapidly growing native shrub is excellent for bordering and naturalizing. It\nassumes a dense, upright form, thriving in even the most polluted air. Other than plenty\nof watering, the vernal Witch Hazel requires no special maintenance.\nCOMMON WITCH HAZEL (Hamamelis virginiana) Height: 8-15'; Spread: 7-14'.\nThis shrub is a larger version of Vernal Witch Hazel with many of the same\nqualities. It is another native woodland plant which has adapted well to landscaping uses.\nThe Common Witch Hazel is recommended for shady areas, but when planted in the sun\nit grows to be a splendid well rounded specimen. It is especially useful in large areas.\nPFITZER JUNIPER (Juniperus chinensis 'Pfitzeriana') Height: 4-6'; Spread: 6-9'.\nThis evergreen is recommended for Broken Screens rather than full-fledged\nhedges because its form lends itself to massing rather than row planting. Pfitzer Juniper\nhas been known to grow 6 feet high and spread 10 to 15 feet within ten years. Thus it\nshould be given plenty of room to grow. Despite its exotic appearance, it is a commonly\nused landscape plant. Junipers, as a group, withstand hot, poor, dry soils of city areas\nprobably better than any other evergreens. However, they do suffer from certain pest\nproblems and should, therefore, be watched closely once they are planted.\nDROOPING LEUCOTHOE(Leucothoe fontanesiana) Height: 3-4'; Spread: 4-6'.\nDrooping Leucothoe is a mound like shrub which is good for planting in front of and\nbetween other flora and beneath trees. It is hardy in city conditions and gives a natural\neffect when planted along borders. This native evergreen is graceful and attractive in all\nseasons. It is easy to transplant but requires a heavy mulch and should be provided with\nat least partial shade. Old branches should be pruned occasionally to stimulate new\ngrowth.\nWINTER HONEYSUCKLE Lonicera fragrantissima) Height: 6-8', Spread: 6-8'.\nThe only resemblance between this shrub and the more familiar Honeysuckle vine\nis its extremely fragrant flowers. The Winter Honeysuckle has a leathery\n324\n"}, {"page": "334", "text": "semi-evergreen leaves and assumes a globe shape as it rapidly grows.

It forms a broad, rounded mass. It becomes tree-like with age but continues\nto branch to the ground. Early in the Spring, it produces numerous fragrant white flowers.\nThe Star Magnolia should not be planted adjacent to shallow rooting trees. It should be\nallowed plenty of sun.\nNORTHERN BAYBERRY (Myrica pensylvanica) Height: 3-6'; Spread: 3-8'.\nThis shrub, often used for windbreaks at the beach, is also effective for shrub\nmasses in Piedmont areas. Its ability to tolerate salt and sands translates into a quality\nfor withstanding the rigors of city life. Bayberry normally forms a dense, spreading\nmound. While it is evergreen at the shore, it may annually drop its leaves in less\ntemperate climates.\nJUDD VIBURNUM (Viburnum juddii) Height: 8'; Spread: 6'.\nViburnums are sturdy shrubs which are commonly available in area nurseries.\nThe Judd Viburnum is rounded and dense. It bears loose clusters of fragrant white\nflowers in the early Spring. If given plenty of water, it will grow rapidly.

Purpose\nThe language contained in this Appendix represents a joint proposal from the staffs of\nUnion County Public Schools, Union County and all Union County Municipalities\nregarding standardized zoning regulations for public school development proposals.\nAt the time of consideration, Union County Public Schools (UCPS) was subject to 13\ndifferent sets of local land use regulations (12 different municipalities and Union\nCounty). Regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, making it difficult to build\nnew schools, renovate existing schools or locate mobile units in a consistent, timely and\ncost effective manner.\nAs a part of the Union County Board of Education's adopted \"Building Program Cost\nSaving Principles\", UCPS endeavors to establish a standard zoning classification and\nstandardized requirements for school construction regardless of the school's locale in\nUnion County. Such standardization will result in (i) equitable school facilities\nthroughout the county; (ii) more efficient permitting of school facilities and (iii) cost\nsavings for the benefit of the taxpayers of Union County.\nI-2.\nSupplemental Regulations and Design Standards\n1. UCPS staff will involve local municipal staff early in the site selection process. The\nlocal municipal staff will make recommendations regarding target sites or areas\nwithin their respective jurisdictions that are suitable for school uses. Pursuant to\nstate statute, final decisions regarding the selection of school sites are made by the\nUnion County Board of Education.\n2. All new schools, additions, or renovation uses shall be allowed by right with the\nsupplemental standards contained herein. This will eliminate the costly and time-\nconsuming discretionary (CUP/SUP) zoning process and site-by-site negotiations.\nAll local government entities benefit by having expectations regarding school design\nand construction identified in advance.\n3. In consideration of whether a proposed project regulated under this Appendix poses\na negative impact to the public health and safety, any such use in the Town of\nFairview shall be a use by right unless any of the following criteria are met. If any of\nthese criteria are met, the application shall be reviewed through the special use\npermit process set forth in Section 54B of this Ordinance\n3.1 If any such proposal causes the capacity of the road that provides primary\naccess to the school to be exceeded within one-mile of the school or, if road\ncapacity is already exceeded, any school that causes an increase in volume\ngreater than 5%.
