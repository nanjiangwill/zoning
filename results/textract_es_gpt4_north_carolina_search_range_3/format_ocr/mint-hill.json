Existing CUD. Prior to the effective date of this UDO, any application, which previously may have been described variously as Conditional Use District,\nParallel Conditional District and/or Parallel Conditional Use District, shall now be known as a Conditional Zoning District.

No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such\npermit for the purpose(s) authorized in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and\nB. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all\npersons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any\ninterest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was\noriginally issued.\n3.6.5 Nonconformities.\nA.

Given the fact that the implementation of this Ordinance and previous zoning\nordinances has in the past and will in the future result in the creation of a number of nonconformities, some of which are viable uses which do not produce\nsubstantial negative impacts, this Ordinance allows the Administrator to approve the expansion and or replacement of nonconforming uses and structures in certain\nsituations as detailed herein.\n3.7.1 General Intent and Exceptions.\nA. Nonconforming uses, which are uses of structures or land existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, but which uses do not comply with\nthe provisions of this Ordinance, are affirmed by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the various districts.

In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements, Commercial Planned Unit Developments are expected to deliver exceptional quality\ncommunity designs that preserve critical environmental resources, provide above average open space amenities, incorporate creative design in the\nlayout of buildings, open space and circulation; assure compatibility with surrounding land uses and neighborhood character; and provide greater\nefficiency in the layout and provision of roads, utilities and other infrastructure. The PUD-CZD shall not be used as a means of circumventing the\nTown's adopted land development regulations for routine developments.\nC. At the time of rezoning, an application that includes a detailed Site Plan of the entire site will also be required pursuant to the regulations and\napplication procedures of Article 8. Decisions with respect to the establishment of a PUD-CZD and the issuance of a Conditional Zoning District\napproval in connection therewith shall be legislative decisions subject to judicial review using the same procedures and standard of review as apply to\ngeneral use district zoning decisions.\nD. Specific requirements and regulations for design and use as well as application requirements are located in Section 7.2.31 and Article 8, respectively.\n(Ord. No. 598, 4-14-2011; Ord. No. 798 7-8-2021)\nSection 4.3 Conditional Zoning\nThe Conditional Zoning (CZ) rezoning process allows for the establishment of certain uses that, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both\nthe immediate area and the community as a whole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district standards. In order to\naccommodate these uses, this Section establishes the Conditional Zoning process. The process for approval of a CZ is explained in Article 8, Subsection 8.5.2A. The\nrezoning of any parcel of land to a CZ shall be a voluntary process initiated by the property owner or his authorized agent. Any area rezoned to a CZ shall be in\ngeneral compliance with the goals, objectives and implementation strategies of the adopted Comprehensive or Land Use Plan and all other plans and regulations\nofficially adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The review process established in this Section provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification\nof property into a CZ, subject to specific conditions (which may exceed those that would otherwise be required for the use in question), which ensure compatibility\nof the use with the enjoyment of neighboring properties and in accordance with the general plans of development of the Town. Some uses require a Conditional\nZoning approval and compliance with the set of initial specific conditions as indicated in the Table of Permitted Uses, Section 5.2 and the corresponding Section 7.2.\nConditional Zoning is not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal.\nOnce a property has been rezoned to a CZD, it shall be referenced with the letters \"CZD\" behind the name of the applicable general zoning district listed in\nSection 4.2. Thus, a property rezoned to a Conditional Zoning District in the B-G (general use district) shall appear on the Zoning Map as \"B-G(CZD).\"\n(Ord. No. 598, 4-14-2011; Ord. No. 798, 7-8-2021)\nEditor's note- Ord. No. 598, adopted July 8, 2021, amended the title of \u00a7 4.3 to read as herein set out. The former 4.3 title pertained to conditional districts.\nSection 4.4 Overlay Districts\nA. Overlay Districts are zoning districts which are applied only in conjunction with the underlying zoning districts and may grant or impose additional use or\ndevelopment requirements upon the underlying zoning districts.\nB. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying district controlling the use and development of the lot. Overlay districts may be applied to\ngeneral or conditional zoning districts.\nC. An overlay district may be initiated as a zoning map amendment by the Board of Commissioners, Planning Board or property owner. The establishment,\namendment or repeal of the boundaries of any overlay district shall be in accordance with procedures set forth in Article 8 for Zoning Map Amendments.\n4.4.1 Manufactured Home Overlay District.\nabout:blank\n45/238\n"}, {"page": "46", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nA. Manufactured Home Overlay District. The Town of Mint Hill has established Manufactured Home Overlay District(s) as shown on the official zoning\nmap. The purpose and intent of this district is to provide areas in which manufactured homes can be located on individual lots. In order that such\nhomes, when placed on the lot, are compatible with single-family residences, the Manufactured Home (MH) Overlay District provides certain size,\nconstruction and aesthetic standards for manufactured homes. The MH Overlay District supplements the range of uses permitted in the underlying\nzoning district. All other uses and regulations for the underlying district shall continue to remain in effect for properties classified in the MH Overlay\nDistrict. The MH Overlay District may only be applied in areas which contain a (R) Residential underlying general zoning district.\nB. Allowed Uses. All uses permitted in the underlying R (Residential) Zoning District are permitted.\nC.\nMinimum Standards for All Manufactured Homes Located in the Manufactured Home Overlay District on Individual Lots or Tracts. All manufactured\nhomes erected after the effective date of this Ordinance amendment shall conform to the following minimum standards for design:\n1. All manufactured homes shall conform to all federal manufactured home construction and safety standards and/or building requirements and/or\ncodes for manufactured homes and bear the required United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) tag and/or data plate.\n2. Reserved.\n3. The manufactured home has a length not exceeding three (3) times its width and the structure must be at least twenty-four (24) feet in width\nalong the majority of its length.\n4. Manufactured homes on individual lots and/or tracts shall be oriented lengthwise with no more than a thirty-degree variation, either way, from\nparallel to the front of the lot and/or property boundary except on corner lots. On corner lots a manufactured home can be oriented lengthwise to\nbe parallel to either street front which will allow the required yard setbacks, or it can be oriented on the diagonal on a corner lot, if setbacks can\nbe met.\n5. The structure shall be set up in accordance with the standards set by the North Carolina Department of Insurance, including tie down standards.\n6. The structure will have all wheels, axles, transporting lights and towing apparatus removed. If any of these items cannot be removed, they shall be\nscreened from view with landscaping or fencing if it is still visible after the unit is underpinned.\n7. The structure shall not be occupied unless it is supported on masonry blocks, provided with continuous skirting from the bottom of the walls to\nthe ground made of continuous brick or other material unpierced except for required ventilation and an access door.\n8. Each manufactured home shall have a pitched roof with a minimum vertical rise of three (3) feet for every twelve (12) feet under of horizontal run\nand must provide an leave projection of no less than six (6) inches, and the roof shall be finished with a type of shingle that is commonly used in\nstandard single-family residential construction.\n9. A permanent access of either brick or pressure-treated wood or a deck of pressure-treated wood shall be installed leading into each door. For\npurposes hereunder, a composite deck product that looks like pressure-treated wood but has a longer life span and requires less maintenance is\nan acceptable material.\n10. All manufactured homes shall otherwise meet all applicable zoning regulations for the zoning district in which it is located as well as all housing\nstandards in the Town of Mint Hill Code of Ordinances, Chapter 12.\n11. Each manufactured home shall be for single-family occupancy only.\n4.4.2 Downtown Overlay District. The Town of Mint Hill has established Downtown Overlay District(s) as shown on the Official Zoning Map. The purpose and\nintent of the Downtown Overlay District(s) is to implement the Downtown Mint Hill Master Plan and regulate uses within the DO-A and DO-B Overlay\nDistricts while also requiring specific building standards and design requirements. The DO-A Overlay District zone is mixed in function, but principally\nresidential in character. The DO-A Overlay District is the largest area of the downtown. As it is shared by many neighborhoods in the downtown area, the\nDO-B District (also referred to as \"Town Center\") shall be the most dense business, service and institutional area and contain the highest concentration of\nsaid respective uses. The DO-A and DO-B Districts encourage a greater variety of uses in close proximity to one another. In order to manage this flexibility,\na\nspecific set of design guidelines has been established to regulate buildings and their relationship to the public realm of the street and formal open\nspaces. Buildings in the Town Center are close to the street and off-street parking is generally to the rear to create an active pedestrian environment. Uses\nwithin the DO-A and DO-B will be subject to the special requirements (\"SR\") found in Section 7.4 and as noted in the Table of Permitted Uses in Section\n5.2. To the extent any special requirements in Section 7.4 for the DO-A or DO-B are inconsistent with any general zoning requirements in Article 6 (or\nelsewhere in this UDO), the special requirements of Section 7.4 shall control and govern the development.\n(Ord. No. 598, 4-14-2011; Ord. No. 798 7-8-2021)\nARTICLE 5. PERMISSIBLE USES\nSection 5.1 Table of Uses Overview and Application\nA.

Conditional Zoning (CZ) Group. This group permits uses in the districts marked with \"CZ,\" subject to the conditions of the respective subsections as\nindicated in the column entitled, \"Subsection No.,\" as well as any other conditions which may be negotiated or recommended by the Administrator or\nTRC, and also subject to the requirements of Article 6, the special conditions for the respective use in Article 7 and other applicable regulations of this\nOrdinance. Uses in this group are subject to the approval of the Board of Commissioners after a public hearing.\nB. District regulations for residence, office-apartments, business and industrial districts shall be as set forth in the Table of Principal Permitted Uses, Section\n5.2 and as indicated in Article 6. Use of land and structures shall be further regulated by the applicable provisions of this Ordinance.\nC. Any unlisted use in the Table of Principal Permitted Uses, Section 5.2, determined to be compatible with a principal permitted use shall be permitted in\nthe same district and shall be classified as to the use group and special requirements, if any, for such specific use, as determined by the Administrator.\nThe Administrator, however, shall always have the discretion to decline to exercise the delegated authority to determine requirements for any use, and in\nsuch case, the applicant may seek a determination from the Board of Adjustment.\nD. The regulations established by this Ordinance within each district shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of\nstructure or land.\nE. No building, structure or land shall be used or occupied, and no building or any part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed,\nmoved or altered, except in conformity with all applicable regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located.\nF. No part of a yard or other required open space or off-street parking or loading space required for a use for the purpose of complying with this Ordinance,\nshall be included as part of a yard, open space or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other structure or building.\nG. No yard or lot existing on the effective date of this Ordinance shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein.\nLots created after the effective date of this Ordinance shall meet the requirements of this Ordinance as a minimum.\nH. To the extent any special requirement for a use is inconsistent with or contradicts a general requirement, then the special requirement shall control and\ngovern the development. For example, the dimensional requirements of Section 7.4 for structures located in the DO-A shall control and govern over the\nmore general dimensional requirements for structures set forth in Section 6.1.1.\n(Ord.

Frontage on Streets. Each lot shall have frontage on a public street with the following exceptions:\n1. Proposed lots for use by single-family detached dwellings and which do not have frontage on a public street (\"easement lots\") may be approved by\nthe Administrator after making the following findings:\na. Such lot is a minimum of two (2) acres in size; and\nb. Such lot is provided with access to a public street by means of an easement at least fifteen (15) feet in width for the exclusive use of the\ndwelling to be established on such lot and such easement is a visible identifiable access driveway which is maintained in a condition passable\nfor service and emergency vehicles; however, in no event shall lots be created that result in more than a maximum of four (4) access\neasements to lots without road frontage; and\nC. Creation of such lot is made necessary by virtue of the fact that development of said property by conventional means (i.e., extension of public\nstreet) is impractical due to disproportionate costs of required improvements as compared to the relative value of lots created; and\nd. Creation of such lots does not unduly restrict or impair future development or extension of an adequate system of public streets within the\nimmediate area.\nProposed easement lots hereunder may be denied by the Administrator in the event such criteria are not affirmatively met.\n2. Lots which do not have frontage on a public street may be approved by the Administrator for uses such as substations, radio and television\ntowers, repeater huts, water towers or tanks, sewage treatment facilities, and similar uses of a public or quasi-public nature when the\nAdministrator in its review finds that:\na. Adequate access to such facility will be provided by other means such as an easement or right-of-way; provided, however, that in no case shall\na right-of-way or easement of less than fifteen (15) feet in width be allowed;\nb. The objectives of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan will be better served by allowing such lot without road frontage; and\nC. Such lots are adequate in size to meet the setback requirements established in this Ordinance for such use.\n3. Lots designed for single-family attached dwellings need not front on a street provided that all portions of the dwelling unit proposed for such lots\nshall be located within three hundred (300) feet of a public street that furnishes direct access to the property and that access to each such lot be\nmade available via either a public right-of-way or a private vehicular or pedestrian way owned by the individual lot owner in fee or in common\nownership.\n4. Lots designed for single-family semi-detached dwellings need not front on a street provided that at least one unit of each dwelling group has\nfrontage on a street and that access to each dwelling unit is made available via either a public right-of-way or a private vehicular or pedestrian way\nowned by the individual lot owner in fee or in common ownership.\nB. Side Lot Lines in Subdivisions. Side lot lines in subdivisions shall, as nearly as practicable, be at right angles to or radial to street lines. Where side lot\nlines intersect at the rear of the lot, the angle of intersection shall not be less than sixty (60) degrees.\n6.1.3 Front Yard Exceptions. The requirements for exceptions to the front yard provisions of Section 6.1.1 are as follows:\nA. Where fifty (50) percent, or more, of a block is developed with structures, the average front yard dimension of such structures may be considered the\nminimum required front yard for a proposed building. Unless required by the front yard established on a subdivision map, such front yard need not\nbe greater than the front yard required in the chart, Section 6.1.1. A front yard indicated on a duly recorded map of a subdivision, shall in no event be\nreduced.\nB.\nWhere it is proposed to erect a structure between two (2) existing structures not over tweo hundred (200) feet apart, the required front yard distance\nmay be the average of the two (2) structures. Unless required by the front yard established on a subdivision map, such front yard need not be greater\nthan the front yard required in the Tables in Section 6.1.1. A front yard indicated on a duly recorded map of a subdivision shall in no event be reduced.\n6.1.4 Measurement of Setback or Building Line. Setbacks or front or side street building lines or other applicable elements required by this Ordinance, shall be\nmeasured from a street property line as such term is defined in Article 2. When a street or roadway is established by some method other than dedication\nby recording a subdivision plat, setbacks or front or side street building lines, or other related elements required by this Ordinance, shall be measured\nfrom a line that is equivalent to the street property line on such a dedicated street. Such equivalent line shall be located a minimum of thirty (30) feet from\nthe centerline of the street or roadway.\nIn the event of a conflict between the currently adopted Mecklenburg Union Metropolitan Planning Organization (MUMPO) Transportation Plan and the Town's\ncurrently adopted Comprehensive Transportation Plan as to how much right-of-way shall be dedicated from the centerline, the transportation plan requiring the\ngreater amount shall control.\nabout:blank\n59/238\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nMEASUREMENT OF SETBACK OR BUILDING LINE\nproperty line\nproperty line\nMin.

In the event road improvements have not been completed at the time of the\nrequest for Final Plat approval and/or a Certificate of Occupancy, the Final Plat shall be approved and/or the Certificate of Occupancy issued only\nwhere an Applicant has submitted a bond or other performance guarantee in accordance with the requirements of Article 6, Section 6.10\n(Guarantees and Performance Bonds), for completion of the street improvements. Any bond or other performance guarantee for street\nimprovements shall be in addition to any other bond(s) that may be required for other improvements. (Note: Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nNCDOT may not allow issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for incomplete driveways despite posting of a bond or other performance guarantee.)\n2. Related to Topography. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage\nand stormwater runoff objectives set forth in Article 6, Sections 6.6,6.7, and 6.8 of this Ordinance and subject to the design requirements relating\nto maximum grades set forth in the Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual.\n3. Block Lengths. Block lengths and widths shall not be more than one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet, except as hereinafter provided. Where a\nlonger block will reduce the number of railroad grade crossings, major stream crossing or where longer blocks will result in less traffic through\nresidential subdivisions from adjoining business or industrial areas, the Administrator may authorize block lengths in excess of one thousand six\nhundred (1,600) feet. Block widths shall be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers of lots; except where single tiers of lots will facilitate nonresidential\ndevelopment, the separation of residential and nonresidential development or the separation of residential development from traffic arteries.\n4. Cul-de-Sacs. Cul-de-sacs, when permitted under this Ordinance, shall not be longer than eight hundred (800) feet and shall be terminated by a\ncircular right-of-way not less than eighty (80) feet in diameter; however, this requirement may be waived where topographical conditions or land\nuse relationships offer no practical alternative.\n5. Medians. Medians containing monuments or structures shall not be accepted as a right-of-way and must be dedicated as common area.\n6.\nSpecial Requirements Control. To the extent any special requirements (for example in the DO-A or DO-B Overlay Districts or in a Conservation\nSubdivision) or conditions for approved Conditional Zoning Districts contain street design and/or construction standards (including for street\nmarkers and other related improvements), then they shall control over these general requirements; however, where the requirements do not\ndirectly conflict, then these general requirements shall supplement.\n7. Temporary Cul-de-Sacs. To the extent these are used they shall conform to the Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual or the\nTown of Mint Hill Standards Manual, when adopted.\n6.2.2 Driveways.\nA. Driveways Required. Every lot shall have access sufficient to afford a reasonable means of vehicular ingress and egress for all those likely to need or\ndesire access to the property in its intended use. Driveways shall comply with other laws and codes, including, but not limited to, the Fire Prevention\nCode of the North Carolina State Building Code or applicable NFPA codes, to the extent applicable to accommodate emergency vehicles, such as fire\ntrucks. All driveways shall be located in accordance with an approved Site Plan and driveways may vary in location/placement on a development by\ndevelopment basis depending on the following factors, including, but not limited to: street trees, type of use, topography of the property to be\ndeveloped, type of road and associated traffic volume, etc. For proposed developments located on roads maintained by NCDOT, all driveways shall be\nlocated as determined by NCDOT (using the NCDOT Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways hereinafter the \"NCDOT\nDriveway Manual\" for guidance). On Town maintained roads, all driveways shall be located as reasonably determined by the Administrator. The\nAdministrator may use the NCDOT Driveway Manual as a guiding document in its determination of required driveway locations in conjunction with the\nfollowing standards to be used for guidance:\nAll driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the Town's planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that:\n1. Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians or vehicles traveling on\nabutting streets; and\n2. Interference with pedestrian movement and the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized.\n3. In considering (1) and (2) above, the following factors shall be considered:\na. The nature of the abutting street, its capacity, use, speed and flow, and reasonably anticipated changes to the street; and\nb. The nature of the proposed use of the land, the traffic generated, the existence and number of drive-through window(s), the internal system\nfor moving vehicles while on the lot; and\nC.\nThe nature of the exit and entrance, the site distance, the distance from intersections, the alignment with other drives and streets, turning\ncontrols or limitations.\nd. The requirements for drive location/separation near an intersection of an existing or planned arterial or collector road found in the\nMecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual.\n4. Shared driveways are encouraged to the extent they accomplish these goals.\nabout:blank\n63/238\n"}, {"page": "64", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nB. Driveway Design and Construction.\n1. All required driveway improvements shall be designed, constructed, completed and approved in accordance with the standards set forth in the\nmost recently adopted Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for apartments, institutional\nuses, offices, business or industrial development, driveways for access to and from a public street, shall not be wider than thirty-five (35) feet as\nmeasured at the property line or future right-of-way line and shall be defined by curbing at such locations as designated by the State and the\nTown. The minimum width of such driveways shall be twenty-four (24) feet for two-way traffic and fourteen (14) feet for one-way traffic.\n2. To the extent any special requirements (for example in the DO-A or DO-B Overlay Districts or in a Conservation Subdivision) or conditions for\napproved Conditional Zoning Districts contain driveway design and/or construction standards, then they shall control over these general\nrequirements; provided however, where the requirements do not directly conflict, then these general requirements shall supplement.\n(Note: As provided in G.S. 136-93, no person may construct any driveway entrance or other opening onto a State-maintained street except in\naccordance with a permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.)\n6.2.3 Sidewalks.\nA. Sidewalks Required. Sidewalk installation is required along all public streets both fronting and within a proposed development, except:\n1. For minor residential subdivisions (five (5) lots or less); or\n2. Where a special regulation or condition would prohibit sidewalks (e.g., an environmentally sensitive area identified and officially designated for low\nimpact development by the Mecklenburg County Water Quality Division or NCDENR).\nIn addition, a material enlargement or expansion of existing construction shall be required to construct sidewalks along all public streets fronting\nand/or within the proposed development for not only the newly proposed expansion or enlargement area, but also for the development as it was first\nproposed and exists at the time of the proposed enlargement or expansion. For purposes hereunder, material enlargement or expansion shall be\ndetermined by a total cumulative twenty (20) percent increase in the total square footage of all existing structure(s) within a project area as and since\nthe original date the project area was first proposed. Expansion of an existing project to include adjoining land with existing structures shall not\nexempt an Applicant or developer from the requirements of this Section.\nB. Sidewalk Design and Construction.\n1. All sidewalks shall be located in accordance with an approved Site Plan and sidewalks may vary in location/placement on a development by\ndevelopment basis depending upon the following factors, including, but not limited to: street trees, type of use, topography of the property to be\ndeveloped, type of road and associated traffic volume, etc. The preferred guidance for location of sidewalks for proposed developments shall be\nthe most recently adopted Town Comprehensive Transportation Plan.\n2. All required sidewalk improvements shall be designed, constructed, completed and approved in accordance with the standards set forth in the\nmost recently adopted Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual. In the event sidewalk improvements have not been completed\nat the time of request for Final Plat approval and/or a Certificate of Occupancy, the Final Plat shall be approved and/or the Certificate of\nOccupancy issued only where an Applicant has submitted a bond or other performance guarantee in accordance with the requirements of Article\n6, Section 6.10 (Guarantees and Performance Bonds) for completion of the sidewalk improvements. Any bond or other performance guarantee for\nsidewalk improvements shall be in addition to any other bond(s) that may be required for other improvements.\n3. Special Requirements Control. To the extent any special requirements (for example in the DO-A or DO-B Overlay Districts or in a Conservation\nSubdivision) or conditions for approved Conditional Zoning Districts contain sidewalk design and/or construction standards, then they shall control\nover these general requirements; provided however, where the requirements do not directly conflict, then these general requirements shall\nsupplement.\n6.2.4 Curb and Gutter.\nA. Curb and Gutter Required. Curb and gutter installation is required as follows:\n1. Along all public streets currently or proposed to be under Town maintenance. Therefore, if a development proposes new Town maintained streets\nor develops on a parcel that fronts on an existing Town maintained street, curb and gutter shall be installed along all Town right-of-way with any\nother infrastructure improvements determined to be required in the approval process.\n2.\nAlong all streets existing or proposed within the adopted Downtown Consensus Overlay Boundary Map regardless of maintenance responsibility\n(Town maintained streets versus NCDOT maintained streets).\n3. Along NCDOT maintained streets if the impact and magnitude of a proposed development requires the construction of a cross section defined in\nthe Town of Mint Hill Comprehensive Transportation Plan (typically any four-lane road or boulevard with a median) then curb and gutter shall be\nrequired consistent with the Comprehensive Transportation Plan cross section for the corridor in question. For clarification, a deceleration lane,\nleft turn lane or lane expansion might not necessarily trigger this requirement.\n4. Along NCDOT maintained streets as may be required by NCDOT.\nWhen curb and gutter is required, it shall be installed on streets both fronting and within a proposed development, except for Minor Subdivisions or\nwhere a special regulation or condition would prohibit curb and gutter (e.g., an environmentally sensitive area identified and officially designated for\nlow impact development by the Mecklenburg County Water Quality Division or NCDENR). An Applicant may choose between valley curb and gutter\nor\nstandard curb and gutter styles except:\nabout:blank\n64/238\n"}, {"page": "65", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\na. Where a special regulation or condition requires a particular style (e.g., a requirement of the PCO or the most recent Comprehensive\nTransportation Plan);\nb. Where a zoning district or overlay district (e.g., DO-A) requires a particular style; or\nC. Where curb and gutter for a proposed development will connect or tie into existing curb and gutter, then the style for the proposed\ndevelopment must match the existing style.\nB. Curb and Gutter Design and Construction.\n1. All required curb and gutter improvements shall be designed, constructed, completed and approved in accordance with the standards set forth in\nthe most recently adopted Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards Manual. In the event curb and gutter improvements have not been\ncompleted at the time of request for Final Plat approval and/or a Certificate of Occupancy, the Final Plat shall be approved and/or the Certificate of\nOccupancy issued only where an Applicant has submitted a bond or other performance guarantee in accordance with the requirements of Article\n6, Section 6.10 (Guarantees and Performance Bonds) for completion of the curb and gutter improvements. Any bond or other performance\nguarantee for curb and gutter improvements shall be in addition to any other bond(s) that may be required for other improvements.\n2.\nSpecial Requirements Control. To the extent any special requirements (for example in the DO-A or DO-B Overlay Districts or in a Conservation\nSubdivision) or conditions for approved Conditional Zoning Districts contain curb and gutter design and/or construction standards, then they shall\ncontrol over these general requirements; provided, however, where the requirements do not directly conflict, then these general requirements\nshall supplement.\n6.2.5 Coordination of Utilities. It shall be the responsibility of the developer of any new subdivision to notify all utility providers (including, but not limited to,\npower, water/sewer, cable, and telephone) of plans for the subdivision as soon as practical after the approval of the Site Plans by the Planning Board to\nensure all the utilities within the development are installed simultaneously to the greatest extent practicable. Easements necessary to accommodate such\nfacilities shall be made available as needed by the developer and as set forth in the approved Site Plan.\n(Ord. No. 598, 4-14-2011; Ord. No. 798, 7-8-2021)\nSection 6.3 - Off-Street Parking and Loading\n6.3.1 Off-Street Parking.\nA. Every new use, or an enlargement, expansion or alteration of an existing use, shall require off-street parking in compliance with this Section, unless\nspecifically exempt from such provisions or portions thereof. To the extent any special requirements (for example in the DO-A or DO-B Overlay\nDistricts) or conditions for conditional zoning districts contain off-street parking requirements, then they shall control over these general\nrequirements; provided, however, where the requirements do not directly conflict, then these general requirements shall supplement.\nB. Any unlisted use shall be referred to the Board of Adjustment for a determination as to the class of use in which such unlisted use may be placed and\nthe off-street parking requirements for such use.\nC. Off-street parking spaces shall be increased when a change of use of either a structure or of land requires additional parking spaces in compliance\nwith this Section. Parking spaces may be decreased when a change of use of either a structure or of land requires less spaces than provided for the\nreplaced use.\nD.\nEnlargement of a structure or increase in the amount of land used may be made for existing uses deficient in off-street parking, provided that the\nenlargement of increase does not represent a requirement in excess of three (3) off-street parking spaces. In the event such increase represents a\nrequirement in excess of three (3) off-street parking spaces, such increase shall require complete compliance of the provisions of this Section for the\nentire use.\nE. No loading area shall be part of the required off-street parking area.\nF. Off-street parking shall be located as follows:\n1. Parking as required herein shall be located on the same lot as the principal use except when specifically permitted to be located elsewhere.\n2. Cooperative provisions for off-street parking may be made by contract between owners of adjacent property and such contract filed with the\nAdministrator. The parking area provided on any one lot may be reduced to not less than half the parking spaces required for the use occupying\nsuch lot. Such cooperative parking shall not be less than the sum of the parking spaces for the uses computed separately.\n3. No parking area shall be located over a sand filter or nitrification field.\n4. In residential areas, the temporary parking or storage of motor vehicles, trailers, or recreational vehicles shall be prohibited in the area between\nthe street property line or the equivalent thereof and the building setback line, except that the temporary parking of automobiles is permitted in\nsuch area upon a driveway or parking areas constructed of a dust free surface. Trailers and other types of recreational vehicles shall be parked or\nstored behind the residence in the rear yard or in the side yard behind the established front building line except on side streets.\n5. Parking areas may be extended into the required rear and side yards, except when such side yard is adjacent to a street and except into such\nareas required by Article 6, Section 6.4.2 (Screening and Landscaping).\nG.

The maximum spacing between trees or shrubs shall be thirty (30) feet.\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \n4. Trees should, when possible, be located behind the right-of-way of the street. When it is necessary to locate landscaping required by this Section\non the right-of-way of a State-maintained road, an encroachment agreement shall be obtained from the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation. Consideration should be given to the alignment of trees or shrubs installed on an adjoining lot and when possible the alignment\nshould be continued along the street. Encroachment into the sight distance area, as defined in Section 6.9.5 of this Ordinance, shall be allowed\nsubject to the requirement that landscaping installed within a sight distance shall be set back as far as is practicable from the intersection of the\ntwo (2) streets forming the intersection.\nCELL (11, 1): \nCELL (11, 2): \n5.\nIn cases where existing trees on a lot or lots are located within the required setback, as specified in Section 6.1.1 (Dimensional Requirements) of\nthis Ordinance, and such existing trees would inhibit or restrict the growth of street trees required by this Section, low growing shrubbery may be\ninstalled in lieu of trees. Such shrubs shall adhere to the locational requirements of Subsections 6.4.2(G)(3) and (4) herein.\n"}, {"page": "69", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nIn cases where properties are zoned residential and have yards that abut the right-of-way of a freeway or expressway as shown on the Adopted Thoroughfare Plan,\na thirty-foot buffer is required to primarily provide a visual screen between the residential use and the freeway/expressway. A secondary objective is to provide a\nnoise buffer to some degree between these transportation corridors and residential uses. Existing vegetation and topographic features shall be retained within this\nthirty-foot buffer. Clearing and grading within the buffer is not allowed except as described in Subsection 6.4.2(H)(6). Where no natural vegetation exists, or where\nthe quality of existing vegetation fails to meet the purpose of providing an opaque barrier between the road and abutting use, supplemental buffer materials will be\nrequired as stated in Subsection 6.4.2(H)(1). These requirements will not be applicable if the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) provides a noise\nabatement or screening wall.\n1. Such buffer will consist of a minimum of ten (10) trees and forty (40) shrubs per one hundred (100) linear feet in an area of sufficient width to\nsupport the plant materials.\n2. Fifty (50) percent of the required trees within the buffer shall be large maturing canopy trees;\n3. All large maturing canopy trees shall have a minimum calipen of two and one-half (21/2) inches, measured six (6) inches aboveground, with a\nminimum height of eight (8) feet at the time of planting and all small maturing understory trees shall be a minimum of two (2) inches in caliper and\nfive (5) feet in height at time of planting;\n4. Shrubs shall be evergreen and at least three (3) feet tall when planted with an average height of six (6) feet within four (4) years. However, twenty-\nfive (25) percent of the shrubs may vary from the above standard. The allowed variations are as follows:\na. Shrubs may be deciduous; or\nb. Shrubs may be two (2) feet tall when planted, provided an average height of three (3) to four (4) feet is expected as normal growth within four\n(4) years.\nShrubs planted on a berm may be of a lesser height, provided the combined height of the berms and plantings is at least six (6) feet after four (4)\nyears.\n5. All trees and shrubs shall be locally adapted to the area and meet the specifications for the measurement, quality and installation of trees and\nshrubs in accordance with \"American Standards for Nursery Stock,\" published by the American Association of Nurserymen. The arrangement of\ntrees and shrubs in the buffer shall be done in a manner that provides maximum visual separation of abutting uses from the use to be buffered,\ntaking into consideration topography and sight lines from abutting uses. In most cases, screening shrubs should be concentrated near the\nproperty line and massed to achieve the maximum screening effect, while trees in the buffer should be distributed throughout the buffer's width.\n6. Required buffers shall not be disturbed for any reason, except for required driveways, sidewalks or other pedestrian or bicycle paths, walls, fences\nor required landscaping, landscaping maintenance and replacement or maintenance and construction of berms or utility lines. However, utility\nline construction must meet the following requirements:\na. The removal of any tree larger than eight-inch caliper shall require the approval of the Mint Hill Planning and Zoning Department.\nb. If utility lines run longitudinally within a buffer yard, the width of the buffer yard shall be increased by the same amount that is cleared for\nplacement of the utility lines; and\nC. To the extent possible, the path cleared for the utility lines shall be replaced with plant materials that are consistent with those that existed\nprior in the buffer yard.\n7.\nIn situations where a natural buffer does not exist, the buffer area may be created with a landscaped earthen berm or a solid masonry fence, both\nwith a minimum of six (6) feet to a maximum of ten (10) feet in height. Berms of six (6) feet in height or less shall have a maximum slope of 3:1,\nand those over six feet shall have a maximum slope of 4:1. No mature trees eight (8) inches in caliper shall be removed to create a landscaped\nearthen berm.\n8.\nIn the event that topographical or other unusual conditions exist which would make strict adherence to the requirements of this Section serve no\nmeaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and maintain the required buffer or screen, the Administrator may alter the\nrequirements of this Section as long as the existing features of the development site in combination with any additional buffer materials comply\nwith the spirit and intent of this Section. Such an alteration may occur only at the request of the property owner, who shall submit a plan to the\nAdministrator showing existing site features that would buffer or screen the proposed use and any additional buffer materials the property owner\nwill plant or construct to buffer or screen the proposed use. The Administrator shall not alter the requirements of this Section unless the\ndeveloper demonstrates that the existing site features in combination with any additional buffer materials will screen the proposed use as\neffectively as the required buffer or screening.\n9. The buffer area may be included as part of the required minimum yards or setback areas and must be indicated on any plats or plans.\nI.\nIn the interior of all parking areas with more than sixteen (16) parking spaces, large maturing canopy trees shall be planted in a manner that provides\nshade for the entire parking area at maturity. To this end, no parking space shall be less than sixty (60) feet from the base of a canopy tree. The use of\ndiffering species around the parking area is encouraged to promote diversity in the overall tree canopy. The use of existing vegetation to satisfy the\nrequirement is encouraged.

The purpose of the stream buffer network in Mecklenburg County is to ensure that the stream and adjacent lands will fulfill their natural\nfunctions. Stream systems are comprised of the stream and their drainage basins. Streams have the primary natural functions of conveying storm and ground\nwater, storing floodwater and supporting aquatic and other life. Vegetated lands adjacent to the stream channel in the drainage basin serve as a \"buffer\" to protect\nthe stream system's ability to fulfill its natural functions. Primary natural functions of the buffer include:\nProtect water quality by filtering pollutants;\nProvide storage for floodwaters;\nAllow channels to meander naturally; and\nProvide suitable habitats for wildlife.\n6.6A.2 Applicability.\n1.\nAll properties shall be subject to the buffer requirements of this Section except those properties which, as of the effective date July 20, 2000, fit into\none of the following categories:\nA. Have been issued a Certificate of Building Code Compliance.\nB. Have a valid building permit.\nC. Have been subdivided by a recorded subdivision plat.\nD. Are included on a valid preliminary subdivision plan.\nE. Have otherwise secured a vested property right under State law or local ordinance.\n2. Redevelopment or expansions to uses included in the above categories are not subject to the buffer requirements of this Section unless it would\nresult in an increase in the total impervious area within the buffer.\n3. In the event that stream buffers are required by another section of this Ordinance, the more stringent stream buffer requirements apply.\nabout:blank\n83/238\n"}, {"page": "84", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\n6.6A.3 Buffer Standards. Required stream buffer widths vary based on the size of the upstream drainage basin. Mecklenburg County's Geographic Information\nSystem (GIS) will serve as a tool to delineate the size of drainagebasins andspecify thecorrespondingbuffer widths. S.W.I.M. stream buffer requirements specified\nin this Section begin at the point where the stream drains fifty (50) acres or greater. Refer to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Stormwater Design Manual for optional\nbuffers on streams which drain less than fifty (50) acres.\n1. Buffer Widths for Streams Draining Equal to and Greater than Fifty Acres. Buffers are required for streams draining areas equal to or greater than fifty\n(50) acres as specified below. Buffer widths for these streams are measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water, landward from\nthe top of the bank on each side of the stream.\nFootnotes:\n(1) Buffer widths for drainage areas of > 640 acres:\n1. The FEMA fringe and Community encroachment lines will be used for floodplain and buffer calculations.\n2. If the floodplain is less than one hundred (100) feet wide, the total width of the buffer on that side of the stream will be one hundred (100) feet\nexcept as provided in 3., below.\n3. So long as the total buffer width is maintained, the buffer may vary in width on either side of the stream based on individual stream side\ntopography provided that the owner(s) control both sides of the stream and the stream side zone is maintained on both sides of the stream.\n2.

The following techniques are available to landowners for mitigation of buffer impacts, upon review and approval\nof a specific site mitigation plan by the Mecklenburg County Department of Environmental Protection. Specifications for these preapproved mitigation\ntechniques are provided in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual.\nA. Installation of Structural BMPs: The installation of an on-site structural BMP designed to achieve specified pollutant removal targets will allow for\nstream buffer impacts on the specific site. The BMP should remain outside the Stream Side Zone if practical. A detailed BMP design plan must be\nsubmitted to the Mecklenburg County Department of Environmental Protection for approval based on specifications and pollutant removal targets\ncontained in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual. This plan must also include a long-term maintenance strategy for\nthe BMP complete with the establishment of adequate financing to support the proposed maintenance practices.\nB.\nStream Restoration: The owner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any stream of equivalent or greater drainage area the condition of\nwhich is determined to be qualified for restoration by the Mecklenburg County Department of Environmental Protection on a 1:1 basis in linear\nfeet of stream. This restoration shall include stream bank improvements and Stream Side and Managed Use Zone re-vegetation, in accordance\nwith the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual.\nC. Stream Preservation: The owner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis\nand convey fee simple and absolute title to the land to the Town of Mint Hill or other conservation organization.\nD. Wetlands Restoration: On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed stream and buffer area (two (2) acres of wetland for each acre of disturbed area), the\nowner may provide a combination of the preservation and/or restoration of wetlands with protective easements, and the implementation of\nstructural or nonstructural BMPs to achieve specific pollutant removal targets within the impacted area as specified in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nLand Development Standards Manual.\nE. Bottom Land Hardwood Preservation: On a 2:1 acreage basis for impacted stream and buffer area (two (2) acres of bottomland hardwood for each\nacre of disturbed area), the owner may provide a combination of the preservation of existing bottom land hardwood forest or other specifically\napproved natural heritage area by conservation easement or other legal instrument, and the implementation of structural or nonstructural BMPs\nto achieve specific pollutant removal targets within the impacted area as specified in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards\nManual.\nF. Controlled Impervious Cover: The owner may commit to, and provide, a specific site development plan that limits overall site impervious cover in\naccordance with Section 6.1 of the Mint Hill Unified Development Ordinance.\nG. Open Space Development: The submission of a specific site development plan which preserves fifty (50) percent of the total land area as\nundisturbed open space shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site.\nH. Mitigation Credits: The purchase of mitigation credits on a 1:1 basis utilizing linear feet of stream impacted and the prevailing rate of purchase as\nestablished by the Mecklenburg County Department of Environmental Protection shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site.\nMitigation credits purchased under any other program (i.e., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) shall not cover this requirement unless the issuing\nagency agrees to relinquish the funds to the appropriate local government agency.\n5.\nOther Mitigation Techniques. No provision of this Part shall prevent the creative development of alternative mitigation plans.

The regulations set out in this Ordinance (sometimes herein referred to as \"this regulation\" or \"this Ordinance\") shall be known and may be\ncited as the \"Floodplain Regulations of Mint Hill, North Carolina.\"\n6.6.2 Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. Chapter 143, Article 21, Part 6; 160D-923; and 160D-702, delegated to\nlocal governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n6.6.3 Findings of Fact.\nA. The flood hazard areas of Mint Hill and Mint Hill's Land Use jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, increased health\nand safety hazards, destruction of property, and disruption of commerce and governmental services. Inundation from floodwaters results in public\nexpenditures for flood protection, flood disaster relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare.\nB. These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the\noccupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise\nunprotected from flood damages.\n6.6.4 Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses\ndue to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\nA. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in\nerosion or in flood heights or velocities;\nB. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of\nfloodwaters;\nD. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and\nE.\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n6.6.5 Objectives.\nA. The regulations of the Special Flood Hazard Areas herein set forth are intended to protect areas of designated floodplains subject to and necessary for\nregulating floodwaters and to permit and encourage the retention of open-land uses which will be so located and designed as to constitute a\nharmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the Town as provided in the comprehensive plans as such are adopted and\namended from time to time.\nB. The specific intent in establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas composed of floodways and flood fringe areas includes the following:\nabout:blank\n87/238\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\n1.\nTo control uses such as fill dumping, storage of materials, structures, buildings and any other works which, acting alone or in combination with\nother existing or future uses, would cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing floodplain storage;\n2. To protect human life and health;\n3. To minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects;\n4. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n5. To permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in flood hazard areas and to assure such permitted uses will not impede the flow of\nfloodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodways;\n6. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;\n7.\nTo protect existing drainage courses that carry abnormal flows of stormwater in periods of heavy precipitations;\n8. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges\nlocated in floodplains;\n9. To meet the needs of the streams to carry floodwaters and protect the creek channels and floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights\nand flood damage will not be increased;\n10. To inform existing and potential property owners that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area as well as the associated flood risks and\ndevelopment restrictions;\n11.

Persons who wish to undertake uses designated as prohibited within the protected stream buffer area\nmay pursue a variance. The variance request procedure shall be as follows:\n(a) Pursuant to Section 305(C)(1) above, for any variance request the Storm Water Administrator shall make a finding of fact as to whether the\nfollowing requirements have been met. The applicant must submit information to the Storm Water Administrator to demonstrate that:\n(i) There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the strict letter of the stream buffer protection\nrequirements. Practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall be evaluated in accordance with the following:\n(I) If the applicant complies with the provisions of the stream buffer requirements, he/she can secure no reasonable return from, nor\nmake reasonable use of, his/her property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit from the property is not\nadequate justification for a variance. Moreover, the Storm Water Administrator shall consider whether the variance is the minimum\npossible deviation from the terms of the stream buffer requirements that will make reasonable use of the property possible.\n(II)\nThe hardship results from application of the stream buffer requirements to the property rather than from other factors such as\ndeed restrictions or other hardship.\n(III) The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property and is unique to the applicant's property, such as its size,\nshape, or topography, such that compliance with the provisions of this ordinance would not allow reasonable use of the property.\n(IV) The applicant did not cause the hardship by knowingly or unknowingly violating the stream buffer requirements.\n(V) The applicant did not purchase the property after February 1, 2009 and then request a variance.\n(ii) The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the State's stream buffer protection requirements and preserves its\nspirit; and\n(iii) In granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured, water quality has been protected, and substantial justice has\nbeen done.\n(b) A variance request pertains to any activity that is proposed to impact any portion of the stream buffer. Pursuant to Section 305(C)(1) above,\nif the Storm Water Administrator has determined that a variance request meets the requirements in Section 305(C)(10)(a) above, then a\npreliminary finding shall be prepared within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request and submitted to SWAC for approval. Once that\napproval is obtained, then the Storm Water Administrator shall submit the variance to the Director of Division of Water Quality (DWQ) to\npresent to the N.C. Environmental Management Commission. Preliminary findings on variance requests shall be reviewed by the N.C.\nEnvironmental Management Commission within ninety (90) days after receipt by the DWQ. Requests for appeals of determinations that the\nrequirements of Section 305(C)(10)(a) have not been met shall be made to the Office of Administrative Hearings for determinations made\nby the Division of Water Quality or the Storm Water Advisory Committee as described in Section 205 of this ordinance for determinations\nmade by the Storm Water Administrator. The purpose of the N.C. Environmental Management Commission's review is to determine if it\nagrees that the requirements in Section 305(C)(10)(a) above have been met. Requests for appeals of decisions made by the N.C.\nEnvironmental Management Commission shall be made to the Office of Administrative Hearings. The following actions shall be taken\ndepending on the N.C. Environmental Management Commission's decision on the variance request:\n(i) Upon the N.C. Environmental Management Commission's approval, the Storm Water Administrator shall issue a final decision granting\nthe variance.\n(ii) Upon the N.C. Environmental Management Commission's approval with conditions or stipulations, the Storm Water Administrator shall\nissue a final decision, which includes these conditions or stipulations.\n(iii) Upon the N.C.

Persons who wish to meet mitigation requirements by way of alternative buffer mitigation options\nshall do so pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0295.\n(306) Diffuse Flow Requirement. Direct discharges of runoff to streams are not allowed. Techniques for providing diffuse flow are specified in the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual or currently adopted Town's standards' manual. Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the\nstream buffer by dispersing concentrated flow and reestablishing vegetation, as follows:\n(A) Concentrated runoff from new ditches or manmade conveyances shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff enters the stream buffer;\nand\n(B) Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken if necessary to impede the formation of erosion gullies.\n(307) Ponds, Lakes and Reservoirs. Ponds, lakes and reservoirs with a hydrologic connection to a perennial or intermittent stream shall comply with the\nbuffer requirements applicable to the stream.\n(308) Wetlands. Sewer lines and associated structures must be a minimum of fifty (50) feet from jurisdictional wetlands associated with the floodplain.\n(309) Stream Buffer Delineation. The following stream buffer delineations are required:\n(A) Streams and stream buffer boundaries including all buffer zones must be clearly delineated on all construction plans, including grading and\nclearing plans, erosion, drainage and sediment control plans and site plans.\nabout:blank\n140/238\n"}, {"page": "141", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\n(B)\nOutside buffer boundaries must be clearly marked on-site prior to any land disturbing activities.\n(C) The outside boundary of the stream buffer must be permanently marked at highway stream crossings.\n(D) Streams and stream buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must be specified on all surveys and record plats.\n(E) Stream buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone as well as all buffer requirements must be specified on all surveys and\nrecord plats, on individual deeds and in property association documents for lands held in common.\n(310) Standards for Storm Water Control Measures.\n(A) Evaluation According to Contents of Design Manual. All storm water control measures and storm water treatment practices (also referred to as\nBest Management Practices, or BMPs) required under this ordinance shall be evaluated by the Storm Water Administrator according to the\npolicies, criteria, and information, including technical specifications, standards and the specific design criteria for each storm water best\nmanagement practice contained in the Design Manual. The Storm Water Administrator shall determine whether these measures will be adequate\nto meet the requirements of this ordinance.\n(B) Determination of Adequacy; Presumptions and Alternatives. Storm water treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in\naccordance with the criteria and specifications in the Design Manual will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity\nperformance standards of this ordinance. Whenever an applicant proposes to utilize a practice or practices not designed and constructed in\naccordance with the criteria and specifications in the Design Manual, the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the practice(s) will\nsatisfy the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this ordinance before it can be approved for use. The Storm Water\nAdministrator may require the applicant to provide such documentation, calculations, and examples as necessary for the Storm Water\nAdministrator to determine whether such an affirmative showing is made.\n(C) Submittal of Digital Records. Upon submittal of as-built plans, the location of storm drainage pipes, inlets and outlets as well as the location of all\nBMPs as well as Undisturbed Open Space must be delivered to the Storm Water Administrator in the digital format specified in the Administrative\nManual.\n(311) Deed Recordation and Indications on Plat. The approval of the Storm Water Management Permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property\nusage that runs with the land, such as plat, recorded deed restrictions or protective covenants, to ensure that future development and redevelopment\nmaintains the site consistent with the approved project plans. The location of all designated Undisturbed Open Space for a site shall be recorded at\nthe Register of Deeds Office as \"Undisturbed Open Space.\" Streams and stream buffer boundaries including the delineation of each buffer zone must\nbe specified on all surveys and record plats. The applicable operations and maintenance agreement pertaining to every structural BMP shall be\nreferenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office upon final plat approval. If no subdivision\nplat is recorded for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement shall be recorded with the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds Office\nso as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching principles. A copy of the recorded maintenance\nagreement shall be provided to the Storm Water Administrator within fourteen (14) days following receipt of the recorded document. A maintenance\neasement shall be recorded for every structural BMP to allow sufficient access for adequate maintenance. The specific recordation and deed\nrestriction requirements as well as notes to be displayed on final plats and deeds shall be contained in the Administrative Manual.\n6.8.4 Undisturbed Open Space.\n(401) Purpose. Undisturbed Open Space provides for a reduction in the negative impacts from storm water runoff through non-structural means. The\ncombination of the structural BMPs described in Section 3 with the non-structural Undisturbed Open Space provisions described in this Section allow\nthe objectives of this ordinance to be fulfilled.\n(402) General Description. Undisturbed Open Space is required for new development as described below unless mitigated (undisturbed open space is not\nrequired for redevelopment). The percentage of Undisturbed Open Space required depends on a project's built-upon area as described below.\nUndisturbed Open Space requirements can be met in stream or lake buffers, designated common areas or on individual lots for residential\ndevelopment (e.g., backyards, borders, etc.). Undisturbed Open Space cannot be designated within rights-of-way, utility easements, etc. where re-\ndisturbance could occur. Grass fields can also be used to meet Undisturbed Open Space requirements; however, the fields must be replanted in\naccordance with the tree planting provisions described in Section 405 (C) below. Undisturbed Open Space is preferred where it will provide maximum\nwater quality benefit (i.e., around gullies and existing drainage areas, adjacent to streams and wetlands, around structural BMPs, etc.).\n(403) Undisturbed Open Space Criteria. Undisturbed Open Space requirements apply to projects as described below.\n(A) Less Than Twenty (20) Percent Built-Upon Area. Undisturbed Open Space is not required for development that has less than twenty (20) percent\nbuilt-upon area.\n(B) Greater Than or Equal to Twenty (20) Percent and Less Than Fifty (50) Percent Built-Upon Area. A project with greater than or equal to twenty (20)\npercent and less than fifty (50) percent built-upon area shall include as Undisturbed Open Space within the boundaries of the project a minimum\nof fifteen (15) percent of the project area.\n(C) Greater Than or Equal to Fifty (50) Percent Built-Upon Area. A project with greater than or equal to fifty (50) percent built-upon area shall include\nas Open Space within the boundaries of the project a minimum of ten (10) percent of the project area.\n(404) Undisturbed Open Space Designation. The Undisturbed Open Space location shall be recorded at the Register of Deeds Office as \"Undisturbed Open\nSpace\" and future disturbance is prohibited except for greenway trails with unlimited public access, new Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utility lines and\nchannel work/maintenance activities by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. Other utility work may be allowed in the Undisturbed Open\nabout:blank\n141/238\n"}, {"page": "142", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nSpace area provided it will not result in loss of Undisturbed Open Space as approved by the Town of Mint Hill.\n(405) Undisturbed Open Space Mitigation.\n(A) Purpose. The purpose of this mitigation is to reduce the cost of complying with the Undisturbed Open Space requirement while ensuring the\nreduction of pollution loads and achievement of ordinance objectives.\n(B) General Description. Approved disturbance to the Undisturbed Open Space area described in Section 403 above must be off-set by an allowable\nform of mitigation, including on-site and off-site mitigation as well as through payment-in-lieu.\n(C) Undisturbed Open Space Mitigation Criteria.\n(1) On-Site Mitigation. On-site mitigation shall allow the disturbance of designated Undisturbed Open Space area on a project with the fulfillment\nof the following criteria on the project site:\n(a) Fifty (50) percent increase in total Undisturbed Open Space area designation above the requirements specified in Section 403 above,\nexcept when the Undisturbed Open Space area qualifies as a \"grass field\" in which case the size of the required Undisturbed Open Space\narea remains unchanged. The portion of the Undisturbed Open Space area that is a grass field, whether or not disturbed, must be\nreplanted with trees as specified in Subsection (c) below.\n(b) Establishment of a minimum of six (6) inches of top soil to the disturbed Open Space area following the completion of construction\nactivities. This material may be obtained from on-site when available.\n(c) Planting of a minimum of thirty-six (36) trees per acre of Undisturbed Open Space area as follows:\n(i) Trees shall have a minimum caliper of one and one-half (1.5) inches.\n(ii) Trees shall be of a quality set forth by the American Standard for Nursery Stock and will be selected from a list of acceptable native\nspecies for planting in Undisturbed Open Spaces established in the Administrative Manual.\n(iii) Planted trees shall contain a mix of at least three (3) different species in roughly equal proportions and be \"large mature shade tree\nspecies\" as defined in the Administrative Manual.\n(iv) Trees shall be planted in accordance with specifications provided in the Administrative Manual.\n(v) Trees shall be warranted for a minimum of two (2) years following planting and any dead or diseased trees must be replaced.\n(d) The area around and between trees must be stabilized using an approved vegetative ground cover and mulch.\n(e) The slope of any graded or disturbed area that is dedicated for Undisturbed Open Space cannot exceed three (3) to one.\n(f) The flow of water across the Undisturbed Open Space area must be controlled to prevent soil erosion or mulch disturbance.\n(2) Off-Site Mitigation. On a case-by-case basis and at the sole discretion of the Storm Water Administrator, the Town of Mint Hill may allow\nUndisturbed Open Space disturbance and off-site mitigation through the acceptance for ownership or conservation easement properties for\nthe protection of Undisturbed Open Space, provided the result will be an increased protection of water quality over what would be attained\nthrough preservation of Undisturbed Open Space or on site mitigation (see Administrative Manual).\n(3) Payment-In-Lieu of Undisturbed Open Space Dedication. Payment-in-lieu of Undisturbed Open Space dedication is only allowed for industrial\nand commercial developments and multi-family projects that are in excess of fifty (50) percent built upon area. Payment-in-lieu shall only be\nallowed to the extent an approved disturbance cannot be offset by on-site mitigation as determined by the Storm Water Administrator. The\nfollowing criteria shall be fulfilled for the payment-in-lieu option:\n(a) A fee shall be paid to the Town of Mint Hill based on the following formula: 1.25 X (appraised value of subject property including intended\nuse without improvements). The appraised value of the subject property shall be determined by a licensed, independent real estate\nappraiser retained by the developer or owner. The Town of Mint Hill may accept the appraised value or at its discretion obtain its own\nappraisal. In the event the parties cannot agree on the appraised value, the two (2) appraised values shall be averaged together to\ndetermine the final appraised value to be used in the formula above.\n(b) Payment shall be accepted by the Town of Mint Hill prior to land disturbing activities.\n(c) The Town of Mint Hill shall use the payment-in-lieu to purchase Undisturbed Open Space in the same delineated watershed as the\nproperty to be disturbed within a maximum of two (2) years of the end of the calendar year from the receipt of the payment. The three (3)\ndelineated watershed districts used for mitigation purposes are described in Section 302 above.

To that end, the Town of Mint Hill\nhas found that it is necessary to enact a new Downtown Overlay Code that addresses specific design issues that are not present in the current\ndevelopment regulations.\nProperties located in this Area have been placed in a Downtown District which regulates the form and use of all existing and new development.\nThese regulations have been designed to permit a greater variety of uses in close proximity to one another than was previously permitted. In order to manage\nthis flexibility a specific set of design guidelines has been established to regulate the buildings and their relationship to the public realm of the street and formal\nopen spaces.\n1.1 APPLICABILITY:\n1. The regulations found in this Section 7.4 (also referred to as the \"Downtown Overlay Code\") shall be considered applicable to all appropriate districts\nindicated on the Downtown Mint Hill Zoning District Map.\n2. Notwithstanding Section 3.7, (Nonconforming Situations), it is intended that any uses or structures made nonconforming because the property upon\nwhich such structures are located is zoned to the DO-A or DO-B District, shall be permitted to expand provided such expansion complies with the\nprovisions of this Section 7.4. The Administrator is permitted to alter requirements not to exceed ten (10) percent that relate to parking, building\nheight, setbacks and building footprint so long as the proposed expansion complies with the spirit and intent of this Downtown Overlay Code.\nAlterations above ten (10) percent, requires Conditional Zoning approval.\n3.

Pavement widths, design speeds, and the number of\nvehicle lanes should be minimized without compromising safety. The specific design of any given street must consider the building types which front on\nthe street and the relationship of the street to the Town's street network. New development with frontages on existing publicly maintained streets shall\nbe required to upgrade all their frontages to meet the standards of this Section. This Code encourages the development of a network of interconnecting\nstreets that work to disperse traffic while connecting and integrating neighborhoods with the existing urban fabric of the Town. Equally as important, the\nCode encourages the development of a network of sidewalks and bicycle lanes that provide an attractive and safe mode of travel for pedestrians and\ncyclists.\nMinor variations and exceptions to street cross-sections may be permitted with approval of the Administrator and the County Engineer if applicable. Such\nexceptions include variations to the pavement width, size and location of on street parking, sidewalks, tree planting areas, street grade, and centerline\nradii in accordance with principles below.\nStreets shall interconnect within a development and with adjoining development. Cul-de-sacs are permitted only where topographic conditions and/or\nexterior lot line configurations offer no practical alternatives for connection or through traffic. Street stubs should be provided with development\nadjacent to open land to provide for future connections. Streets shall be planned with due regard to the designated corridors shown on the\nThoroughfare Plan.\nStreets shall be designed as the main public space of the Town and shall be scaled to the pedestrian.\nStreets shall be bordered by sidewalks on both sides.\nStreets shall be designed with street trees planted in a manner appropriate to their function. Commercial streets shall have trees which compliment\nthe face of the buildings and which shade the sidewalk. Residential streets shall provide for an appropriate tree canopy, which shades both the street\nand sidewalk, and serves as a visual buffer between the street and the home.\nWherever possible, street locations should account for difficult topographical conditions, paralleling excessive contours to avoid excessive cuts and\nfills and the destruction of significant trees and vegetation outside of street rights-of way on adjacent lands.\nAll streets shall be constructed in accordance with the design and construction standards in this code and shall permit public access whether by\neasement or by public dedication. Closed or gated streets are strictly prohibited.\nAll on-street parking provided shall be parallel. Curb or angle parking is permitted when the fronting buildings are more than twenty-six (26) feet in\nheight to ensure a safe and usable pedestrian realm and where traffic speeds are very low (twenty (20) mph or less).\nThe use of traffic calming devices such as raised intersections, landscaping bulb-outs, and traffic circles are encouraged as alternatives to conventional\ntraffic control measures.\n5.2 DESIGN STANDARDS: The following specifications shall apply to street design:\nA.\nabout:blank\n189/238\n"}, {"page": "190", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nSidewalks. Sidewalks shall be constructed along both sides of all streets except alleys and lanes. Cul-de-sacs and closes shall be reviewed on a site-by-site basis for\nthis requirement. Residential sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width. Sidewalks serving mixed use and commercial areas shall be a minimum of eight\n(8) feet in width (ten (10) to twelve (12) feet is preferable in front of shop fronts); however the Administrator and Town Manager may reduce this minimum width to\n(no less than five (5) feet) if there are practical difficulties with a wider sidewalk. All sidewalks shall be constructed in brick pavers, concrete, or a similar material.\nConcrete sidewalks shall be a minimum of four (4) inches in depth.\nB. Street Trees and Planting Strips.

For large maturing canopy trees such as Willow Oaks and Red Maples a\nminimum of eight (8) feet planting strip is required.\nC. Cul-de-Sacs. Where practical, a close should be used in place of a cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sacs, if permitted, shall not exceed two hundred fifty (250) feet in\nlength from the nearest intersection with a street providing through access (not a cul-de-sac). Cul-de-sacs shall be offset from the street centerline and\nshall form a square.\nD. Curb Return Radii. Curb radii shall be designed to reduce pedestrian crossing times along all streets requiring sidewalks. In general, curb radii should\nnot exceed twenty (20) feet.\nE. Utility Location. Underground utilities (except water and sewer) should be located in alleys and lanes. If no alley or lane is provided, then a five-foot\n(minimum) utility easement shall be provided behind the sidewalk located within either the right-of-way or a public utility easement.\nF. Curbs and Drainage. Curbs shall be constructed in accordance with Mecklenburg County Land Development Standards. Vertical face curbing is\nrequired along all streets with on-street parking and around all required landscaping areas and parking lots. Mountable curbing is permitted around\ncenter medians, roundabouts, and other features in order to facilitate the infrequent use by vehicles with larger turning radii Valley curbing is\npermitted along streets which serve homes with front-loaded off-street parking or that have infrequent on-street parking. Streets with a grade\nexceeding two (2) percent shall use standard curbs. Drainage shall be provided using curb and gutter piped systems along all streets except along\nparkways that may use open swales upon approval of the Administrator and the County Engineer. All drainage grates must be safe for bicyclists.\nBicycle-safe drainage grates are Types E, F, and G as approved by the NCDOT.\nG. Centerline Radius. Centerline radii may be varied for low-speed streets in accordance with the following table (see also ITE TND Standards p. 26):\nH. Street Signs and Stop Signs. Decorative street signs and stop signs approved by staff shall be erected by the developer within all new development\nlocated in the Downtown.

The purpose of this Section is to provide direction in controlling light spillage and glare so as not to adversely affect motorists, pedestrians, and land\nuses of adjacent properties. Lighting intensities should be controlled to assure that excessive light spillage and glare are not directed at adjacent\nproperties, neighboring areas, and motorists.\nB. As a general rule, lighting should be provided with lower-intensity, full-spectrum bulbs mounted on poles eight (8) to twelve (12) feet in height.\nC. Exterior lighting should be architecturally integrated with the architectural character of the building. Downcast or cutoff type lighting fixtures should\nbe generally used to illuminate pedestrian or traffic circulation corridors. Bollard or decorative cutoff-type lighting fixtures are generally suited for\npedestrian applications such as for pedestrian circulation or transitional areas.\nD.\nDetermination of light fixtures and level of illumination to achieve a certain function or desired effect should also reduce or eliminate the hazardous\naspects and nuisance of glare and light spill over. All exterior lighting, with the exception of street lighting, that is used in and around buildings,\nrecreation areas, parking lots, and signs, shall be designed to protect against the spill-over of light to adjacent properties.\nE.\nLighting may be characterized by the kind of fixtures to be installed (such as incandescent, fluorescent, etc.); by use or activity being served, (i.e.,\nsports activities, utility lighting, lot lighting, or security lighting); or by desired effect, (i.e., spot lighting). Lighting design, location, and fixture selection\nshould be planned to serve the primary lighting objective.\n7.2 STREET LIGHTING STANDARDS:\nA. No street light shall be more than two hundred fifty (250) feet from another street light. In addition, lighting shall be placed at every intersection.\nB.

All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the maximum illumination measured in footcandles at the property line shall not\nexceed .3 for non cut-off lights and 1.5 for cut-off lights. The average intensity illumination for outdoor lighting shall not exceed six (6) footcandles\nin intensity as measured at grade. Fixtures should be placed to provide uniform distribution of light and to avoid intense lighting that produces\nexcessive glare.\n3.\nLighting fixtures in scale with pedestrian activities shall provide for uniform distribution of lighting to produce minimal shadows.\n4. Because of their unique requirements for nighttime visibility and limited hours of operation, the lighting of active recreation areas, such as for ball\nfields and tennis courts are not considered in this Section. Lighting conditions for such uses shall be approved by the Administrator in accordance\nwith approved standards and specifications.\n5. No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted. Light sources should not be located within any perimeter-landscaped areas except on pedestrian\nwalkways.\nB. Lighting levels are to be measured in footcandles with a direct-reading, portable light meter. The meter sensor shall be mounted not more than six (6)\ninches above ground level in a horizontal position. The Administrator takes readings only after the cell has been exposed long enough to provide a\nconstant reading. Measurements are made after dark with the light source in question on, then with the same source off. The difference between the\ntwo (2) readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted illumination and at the property line at ground level.\n8.0 LANDSCAPING\nThe three (3) types of landscaping are defined as follows, and shall meet the following performance requirements. All new development, changes in\nprincipal use, and building expansions shall comply with these provisions.\nThe responsibility for the installation shall rest solely with the proposed development and shall be located on the development's site or in a landscaping\neasement granted by an adjacent landowner.\n8.1 TYPES OF LANDSCAPING:\nA. TYPE A (Opaque Screen/Buffer). This type functions as an opaque screen from the ground to a height of at least eight (8) feet. This type excludes visual\ncontact between uses and creates a strong impression of spatial separation. Composition of the Type A landscaping may include a wall, landscaped\nearthen berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of these elements. Intermittent planting of deciduous and\nevergreen trees shall obtain a height at maturity of no less than 20 feet and have no unobstructed openings wider than ten (10) feet between tree\ncanopies upon maturity. Shrub plantings shall have a minimum height of three (3) feet at installation and have no unobstructed openings wider than\nfour (4) feet. At least fifty (50) percent of the required trees, and at least seventy-five (75) percent of the required shrubs, shall be evergreen species\nlocally adapted to the area. The use of existing vegetation to satisfy this requirement is encouraged. Supplemental planting may be required in\naddition to native materials.\nLOCATION AND REQUIRED USAGE: Rear and/or side transition yards between DO-B and non-DO-B lots (minimum width thirty (30) feet) and the\ntransition yard between DO-A nonresidential and multifamily uses and adjacent single-family uses (minimum width ten (10) feet).\nB. TYPE B (Semi-Opaque Screen). This type functions as a semi-opaque screen from the ground to at least a height of four (4) feet for screening of car\nlights and glare. Composition of the Type B landscaping may include a wall, fence, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate\ncombination of the elements. Intermittent planting of deciduous and evergreen trees shall obtain a height at maturity of no less than twenty (20) feet\nand have no unobstructed openings wider than twenty (20) feet between canopies upon maturity.

Appointed Boards. Members of appointed boards shall not vote on any advisory or legislative decision regarding a development regulation adopted\npursuant to this UDO where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable\nfinancial impact on the member. An appointed board member shall not vote on any zoning amendment if the landowner of the property subject to a\nrezoning petition or the applicant for a text amendment is a person with whom the member has a close familial, business, or other associational\nrelationship.\n3. Administrative Staff. No staff member shall make a final decision on an administrative decision required by this UDO if the outcome of that decision\nwould have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the staff member or if the applicant or other person subject to that\ndecision is a person with whom the staff member has a close familial, business, or other associational relationship. If a staff member has a conflict of\ninterest under this section, the decision shall be assigned to the supervisor of the staff person or such other staff person as may be designated by the\ndevelopment regulation or other ordinance.

No. 798, 7-8-2021)\nabout:blank\n196/238\n"}, {"page": "197", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nState Law reference-Planning board, G.S. 160D-301; board of adjustment, G.S. 160D-302.\nSection 8.2 - Overview of Available Approvals/Permits; Types of Plans and Procedural Steps; Fees; UDO Admin Manual; Other Legal Requirements\nA. Approvals/Permits. As an overview, the following approvals and permits are contemplated by this UDO:\n1. Subdivision Approval. Except for the statutory exemptions identified in Subsection 8.4(B) (Activities that Constitute a Subdivision), any subdivision of\nland requires approval of an appropriate subdivision plat. Subdivisions are classified as \"Major\" and \"Minor\" with Minor Subdivisions having a\nsimplified review and approval process. The Planning Board reviews and approves Site Plans (Preliminary Plats) for Major Subdivisions and the\nAdministrator approves Final Plats for all subdivisions. Procedures are summarized in Section 8.4.\n2. Amendments to Text and Zoning Map. Changes to the text of this UDO or any changes (rezonings) of the zoning map must be approved by the Board\nof Commissioners. These are legislative procedures and are summarized in Section 8.5.1.\n3.\nConditional Zoning Approval. One special type of zoning text and map amendment is a Conditional Zoning Approval whereby a specific site plan and\nwritten conditions are reviewed and approved by the Board of Commissioners (referred to herein as the Zoning Plan). As provided in the Table of\nPermissible Uses (Section 5.2), some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding\narea and/or the entire community that cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards and thus are only permitted with a\nConditional District Zoning approval. Additionally, there may be instances where a general zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a\ncertain property, but a specific use permitted under that district and subject to restrictive conditions would be consistent with the spirit and objectives\nof this Ordinance and applicable land plans. Both of these circumstances are reasonably addressed through a Conditional Zoning process. Conditional\nZoning is a legislative procedure under which the Board of Commissioners has the authority to increase, tighten, add, vary, modify or waive specific\nconditions or standards and is summarized in Section 8.5.2.\n4. Nonresidential By-Right Development Approval. Commercial use and development is by-right in certain districts (e.g., DO-A and DO-B). Often, there\nare special design requirements for commercial developments requiring submission and approval of a Site Plan. Procedures are summarized in\nSection 8.6.\n5. Land Development Permits (Such as Grading, Sedimentation and Erosion Control, Post-Construction Ordinance and Related Stormwater Permits and\nDriveway Permits). Other permits may be issued to confirm compliance with aspects of this UDO or other applicable legal requirements. For example,\nmost \"horizontal\" work (e.g., grading, sedimentation and erosion control, roads, stormwater and utilities) requires associated permits (generally \"Land\nDevelopment Permits\"). This is an administrative procedure and involves confirmation that applicable UDO and other legal requirements are satisfied.\nAdditionally, issuance of the required Land Development Permits requires confirmation that other related prerequisite approvals (such as a Zoning\nPlan approval by the Board of Commissioners for a Conditional Zoning or by the Planning Board in connection with a Major Subdivision approval) have\noccurred or permits (such as a driveway permit from NCDOT) have been issued. As of the date of the adoption of this UDO, Mecklenburg County\nLUESA staff handles review, issuance, approval and final inspection for all Land Development Permits. The Town will place an administrative hold on\nissuance of Land Development Permits within the LUESA system pending prerequisite Town approvals. Procedures and requirements for Land\nDevelopment Permits are summarized in Subsection 8.3(B)(7) (and see also Article 6, Section 6.6 [SWIM Buffers], Article 6, Section 6.7 [Soil Erosion and\nSedimentation Control], and Article 6, Section 6.8 [Post-Construction Ordinance]).\n6. Miscellaneous Permits. Various other permits are required in certain circumstances. For example, Temporary Permits for certain temporary uses and\nSign Permits are required. Detailed procedures for such miscellaneous permits are summarized in Section 8.7.\n7. Building Permit. Generally, all \"vertical\" construction work requires a building permit (\"Building Permit\"). This is an administrative procedure and\ninvolves confirmation that applicable UDO and other legal requirements (e.g., State Building Code) are satisfied. As of the date of the adoption of this\nUDO, Mecklenburg County LUESA staff handles review and approval of the Building Permit. Detailed procedures for Building Permits are summarized\nin Subsection 8.3(B)(8).\n8.\nFinal Inspections. After completion of construction, various inspections and final approvals are obtained. For example, upon completion of all ground\nwork as permitted by various Land Development Permits, LUESA inspects and reviews the final as-built drawings. As another example, all buildings\nrequire a Certificate of Occupancy before commencement of use. Issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy is an administrative procedure that involves\nconfirmation that applicable UDO, State building codes and other applicable legal requirements are satisfied. LUESA issues the Certificate of\nOccupancy. Often bonds are required as a condition to confirm completion of certain construction-related items (e.g., streets) (see Article 6, Section\n6.10, Guarantees and Performance Bonds). Detailed procedures are summarized in Subsection 8.3(B)(9).\n9. Form of Approval. A development approval shall be in writing and may contain a provision requiring the development to comply with all applicable\nState and local laws. The officer making the determination shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the\ndetermination and to the party who sought the determination, if different from the owner. Development approvals may be issued in print or\nelectronic form. Any development approval issued exclusively in electronic form shall be protected from further editing once issued. Applications for\ndevelopment approvals may be made by the landowner, a lessee or person holding an option or contract to purchase or lease land, or an authorized\nagent of the landowner. An easement holder may also apply for development approval for such development as is authorized by the easement.\nEach of the above referenced approvals has its own respective application and approval processes, fees, substantive requirements for approval and expiration\ntime frames.\nB. Types of Submittals. In connection with the above referenced approvals, there are four (4) different \"site plan\" submittals that may occur:\nabout:blank\n197/238\n"}, {"page": "198", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nPre-Sketch Drawing. The Pre-Sketch Drawing is an informal submittal containing very basic information about the existing features of the property and\nthe Applicant's idea for the proposed development project. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Polaris GIS Mapping System on the internet is recommended as an\nexcellent, user-friendly tool for quickly identifying existing features of a subject property and printing a topographical representation of the subject\nproperty. The Administrator will work with an Applicant to identify the map layers on the topographical representation most useful for the initial Pre-\nSketch Drawing. An Applicant may either use a printed Polaris map (or a map from any other GIS mapping system) of the subject property or a survey of\nthe property as the underlying base document (\"Base Document\") for the Pre-Sketch Drawing submittal. The Applicant shall overlay any proposed\nmodifications over the Base Document in order to provide a visual depiction of the proposed development project. This is a very high-level, concept\ndrawing and the overlay may be hand drawn, drawn by a computer program, or depicted in any manner the Applicant chooses.

Formal Applications: Process and Steps.\n1. Application.\na. Who May Submit Applications. Applications for any required approvals or permits will be accepted only from persons having the legal authority to\ntake action in accordance with the permit or the approval. By way of illustration, in general this means that applications should be made by the\nowners or lessees of property, or their agents, or persons who have contracted to purchase property contingent upon their ability to acquire the\nnecessary permits under this Ordinance, or the agents of such persons (who may make application in the name of such owners, lessees, or\ncontract vendors). If an Applicant is not the property owner, the owner shall either sign the application or provide notice to the Administrator as to\nthe identity of the agent with authority to submit the application.\nb. Applications to be Complete.\ni. An application must be complete before it will be accepted for review and action. For any of the various Land Development Permits (and Major\nSubdivision applications and Nonresidential By-Right Developments), an application requires a formal Site Plan be submitted in accordance\nwith the requirements of Subsection 8.2(B)(3) and this Section.\nii. Subject to Subsection (iii), an application is complete when the Administrator determines: 1) the applicable fee(s) to the Town (and County)\nhave been paid: and 2) the application contains all the information necessary for the approving or permit-issuing authority to decide whether\nor not the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all the requirements of this Ordinance.\niii. The Administrator may develop and include in the UDO Admin Manual application forms, instructional sheets, checklists or other techniques\nor devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and the form and type of information that must be submitted.\niv. The Applicant shall submit as many copies of the application and plans to the Town as required in UDO Admin Manual.

In the event no material deviation exists, the Town Board\n(or\nAdministrator) approval shall become effective. In the event staff identifies any material deviation between the Site Plan approved by the Town Board and that\napproved by LUESA, the Applicant shall be required to resubmit the LUESA-approved Site Plan to the Board for its final approval.

Conditional Zoning District Overview. A Conditional Zoning District allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with certain\npredetermined Ordinance standards and with additional, varied, modified or waived conditions pertaining to each individual development project.\nSome land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and/or the entire\ncommunity that cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. Such uses are identified in the Table of Principal Permitted\nUses in Section 5.2 as uses permitted in accordance with this Conditional Zoning process. Moreover, there are instances where a general zoning\ndistrict designation is inappropriate for a certain property, but a specific use permitted under that district and subject to restrictive conditions would\nbe consistent with the spirit and objectives of this Ordinance and applicable land plans. Conditional Zoning, herein established, is intended to\naccommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is intended for firm development proposals and is neither intended nor suited for securing\nearly zoning for tentative uses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\nB. Parallel Conditional Zoning. Possible conditional zoning include the following parallel Conditional Zoning:\nConditional Zoning\nR (CZ)\nO-A (CZ)\nB-G (CZ)\nB-D (CZ)\nB-P (CZ)\nI-G (CZ)\nI (CZ)\nDO-A (CZ)\nDO-B (CZ)\nAdditionally, the PUD-CZ District is a Conditional Zoning District which does not have a parallel general district (see Section 7.2.31).\nabout:blank\n213/238\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \n8.5.2A General Procedures for Approval of Conditional Zoning.\nCELL (2, 1): \nA.

No. 598, 4-14-2011)\nSection 8.8 - Vested Rights in Certain Circumstances\nA. Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to implement the provisions of G.S. 160D-108 pursuant to which a statutory vested right is established upon\napplication for and approval of a \"site-specific development plan\" as defined in Section 2.4.\nB. Establishment of a Vested Right.\n1. A vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid approval, or conditional approval, by the Board of Commissioners, of a site-specific\ndevelopment plan, following notice and public hearing.\n2. The Board of Commissioners may approve a site-specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as may be necessary to protect the public\nhealth, safety and welfare.\n3. Notwithstanding Subsections 8.8(B)(1) and (2), approval of a site-specific development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not\nconfer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained.\n4. A site-specific development plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the Board of Commissioners' action or ordinance related\nthereto.\n5. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the\nallowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land-use\nregulation by the town, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, housing and mechanical codes. Otherwise applicable new or\namended regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a site-specific development plan upon the expiration or\ntermination of the vested right in accordance with these regulations.\n6. A vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site-specific development plan, all\nsuccessors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable.\nC. Approval Procedures and Approval Authority.\n1. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, an application for site-specific development plan approval shall be processed in accordance with\nprocedures established by this Ordinance and shall be considered by the Board of Commissioners for the specific type of land use permit or approval\nfor which application is made.\n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 8.8(C)(1), if the authority to issue a particular land use permit or approval has been delegated by\nordinance to a board, committee or administrative official other than the Board of Commissioners, in order to obtain a vested right, the applicant\nmust request in writing at the time of application that the application be considered and acted on by the Board of Commissioners following notice and\na public hearing as provided in G.S. 160D-601. Thus, by way of example, an applicant requesting approval of a Zoning Plan as part of a Conditional\nZoning application may request a vested right pursuant to this subsection as part of its Conditional Zoning application and such request shall be\nconsidered by the Board of Commissioners concurrently with its consideration of the Conditional Zoning application. As a further example, in\nconnection with a Site Plan being considered by the Planning Board in connection with a residential development (or the Administrator in connection\nwith a commercial by-right development in the downtown overlay district), the applicant requesting a vested right pursuant to this subsection will,\nsubsequent to any approval by the Planning Board (or the Administrator, if applicable), need to make a separate application for a vested right\npursuant to this subsection.\n3. In order for a vested right to be established upon approval of a site-specific development plan, the applicant as defined in Section 2.4 must indicate at\nthe time of application, on a form to be provided by the Town, that a vested right is being sought.\nabout:blank\n219/238\n"}, {"page": "220", "text": "6/22/23, 3:17 PM\nMint Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\n4. Each map, plat, site plan or other document evidencing a site-specific development plan shall contain the following notation: \"Approval of this plan\nestablishes a vested right under G.S. 160D-108. Unless terminated at an earlier date, the vested right shall be valid until\n(date).\"\n5. Following approval or conditional approval of a site-specific development plan, nothing in this Section shall exempt such a plan from subsequent\nreviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not\ninconsistent with the original approval.\n6. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the revocation or the original approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and\nconditions of the approval of this Ordinance.\nD.
