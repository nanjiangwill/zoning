Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay (TNDO)\n(13.) Mini Farm Overlay (MFO)\n(14.) Scenic Corridor Overlay (SCO)\n(15.) Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\nMarshville Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 1\n"}, {"page": "2", "text": "8.3\nDescription of Zoning Districts\nThe zoning districts created by this ordinance are described as follows:\nThe Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural\nproduction, agricultural based businesses and related activities. Farm land is a defining\nelement of Marshville's identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving\nthe\ncharacter of the Town. Listed uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are\nagricultural in nature. Development density is very low to encourage preservation of\nagricultural lands while discouraging large lot residential development. The Agriculture\nDistrict can also be used to protect open spaces.\nThe Single-Family Residential Districts (SFR-1, SFR-2 and SFR-3) provide for the\ncompletion of existing residential neighborhoods and the development of new residential\nneighborhoods. Allowed building/lot types in the Single-Family Districts are Detached\nHouse and Civic Building. Listed uses are restricted to Single-Family homes and their\naccessory uses, a limited number of related uses that serve the residential neighborhoods,\nand civic uses. Neighborhoods in these districts are the dominant land use in Marshville\nand are a major element in defining the character of the community. Standards for the\nSingle-Family Residential Districts ensure that new development maintains the character\nof the community. The Single-Family Residential Districts permit the completion and\nconformity of conventional residential subdivisions already existing or approved in\nsketch plan form by the Town of Marshville prior to the effective date of these\nregulations.\nThe Residential /Main Street Transitional District (R/MST) provides for the completion\nof existing residential neighborhoods in the residential area(s) surrounding the Main\nStreet and Main Street Periphery District through in-fill development. The intent of this\ndistrict is to recognize that most of the area surrounding the core of the downtown\ndeveloped prior to the adoption of standards such as zoning and subdivision regulations.\nThe gradual transformation of existing development to high quality mixed density\nresidential development is needed to support the central core of the Town. Higher\ndensity residential development allows a greater number of households to walk or bike,\nthus reducing the parking demand and providing environmental and health benefits.\nAllowed building/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached House,\nMulti-family Building, and Civic Building. Streets in the Residential/Main Street\nTransitional District should be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a\nconnection from Marshville's downtown to the Single-Family Residential districts\nsurrounding these neighborhoods. A range of housing types is encouraged.\nMarshville Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 2\n"}, {"page": "3", "text": "The Main Street Periphery District (MSP) provides for the development and maintenance\nof a range of uses in areas adjacent to Marshville's core downtown area. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in these districts are Multi-Family, Detached House, Attached House\nfor both residential and/or non-residential listed uses, and Civic Building. In this district,\nthe development pattern integrates limited service, limited retail, office, civic,\neducational, religious, and residential uses in an environment that is pedestrian friendly\nwhile acknowledging the role of the automobile as a means of transportation. Street and\nsidewalk networks providing multi-modal transportation options connect the Periphery\nDistrict to the downtown and to surrounding neighborhoods. The Periphery District\nprovides an area for the expansion of the Main Street District.\nThe Main Street District (MS) provides for new development, revitalization, reuse, and\ninfill development in Marshville's core downtown. A broad array of uses is permitted to\nenable the needs of residents and visitors to be met. Allowed building/lot types in this\ndistrict are Urban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, Attached House, and Civic\nBuilding. The development pattern seeks to integrate shops, restaurants, services, work\nplaces, civic, educational, and religious facilities, and higher density housing in a\ncompact, pedestrian-oriented environment. The Main Street District serves as the hub of\nthe surrounding neighborhoods and of the broader community. The Main Street District\nmay be expanded over time to meet the needs of the growing community for downtown\nfacilities and services. Expansion of the Main Street District shall be contiguous and not\nseparated from the primary district area.\nThe Civic District (CIV) provides a location for large educational, medical, and public\nuses in a campus like environment. Large developments in the Civic District are\nencouraged to provide a master plan to the Town. Institutional uses in the Civic District\nare required to provide pedestrian connections on their campuses and, to the extent\npossible, develop an internal street system with structures fronting on the streets. Parking\nshould not be the dominant visible element of the campuses developed for institutional\nuses.\nThe Transitional Mixed Use District (TMU) is established to provide opportunities for\ncompatible and sustainable development where US Hwy. 74 has impacted older\nresidential areas and where the dominant mode of transportation is the automobile. The\nauto-oriented street, lot, and building designs can create uncomfortable pedestrian\nenvironments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow a greater\nnumber of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected\nnetwork of streets and sidewalks. Allowed building/lot types are Highway Commercial,\nUrban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, and Attached House. Dominant uses in\nthis district are residential, retail and office. The Transitional Mixed Use District is\nexpected to serve Marshville residents as well as persons who travel from surrounding\ncommunities. The development pattern in this district acknowledges the role of the\nMarshville Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 3\n"}, {"page": "4", "text": "automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Transitional Mixed Use District ensure the creation of a\npleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling a compatible transition to uses in\nadjacent districts.\nThe US 74 Commercial District (C 74) is established to provide opportunities for\ncompatible and sustainable development along the US 74 corridor where future\nMarshville neighborhoods will interconnect with this Bypass type roadway corridor\nwithout negatively dissecting the community. Development standards in the US 74\nCommercial District acknowledge that the automobile is the primary mode of\ntransportation. Development and design standards encourage pedestrian scale\ndevelopment along a secondary street network serving larger projects. Goals of the US\n74 Commercial District include providing a pleasant environment for motorists, a safe\nenvironment for pedestrians along the secondary network of streets and pedestrian\nfacilities; ensuring the safety of motorists and pedestrians; and preserving the capacity of\nthe Bypass to accommodate high traffic volumes at higher speeds outside the core area as\nshown in the adopted Town Plan. Uses in this district include services, employment,\nresidential and industrial. Allowed building/lot types include Highway Commercial,\nUrban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, and Civic Building.\nThe Industrial District (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that,\ndue to the scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the\ncommunity. Uses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale\nmanufacturing and storage that is compatible with less intensive uses can and should be\nlocated in other non-residential or mixed use districts. The Industrial District is reserved\nfor uses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities.\nAllowed building and lot types are Highway Commercial and Civic Building.\nThe Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TNDO) provides for the\ndevelopment of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing\nneighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of\ninterconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional\nNeighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices,\nprominently sited civic or community building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and\nchurches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood\nDevelopment (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is\na quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of\nthe existing developed area of the Town, and has an overall residential density of up to 16\ndwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated\nto open spaces.\nMarshville Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 4\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "The Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel,\nor property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and\nagricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit\nper developed acre, projects developed in accordance with these standards can obtain\ndensity bonuses while preserving unique natural features for agricultural use. The Mini\nFarm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land and open space\nwith density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the\nintent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the\nTown and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached House.\nThe Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes\nand open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Marshville's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through a\nmix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the rural\ncharacter of the Town by maintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban\nenvironment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and ensure a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The Detached House\nlot/building type is allowed in this district.\nThe Heavy Industry Overlay District (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development. It is the intent\nof this section to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and\nfacilities that incorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including:\nwholesale, distribution, storage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it\nis required that industries in this district take all necessary actions including but not\nlimited to installation of apparatus and technological equipment available to prevent\nnegative impacts on the environment and the community from the emissions of smoke,\ndust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities and/or products resulting from such\nhazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.\n8.4\nZoning District Development Standards\nDevelopment standards are established for each of the following Primary General-Use\nDistricts to promote the orderly development of the Town of Marshville.

SPECIFICATIONS\n9.1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Article is to establish standards and specifications for the buildings\nand lots permitted in each of the zoning districts established in Article 8. The standards\nand specifications set forth below are established to ensure that new development and\nconstruction is enduring and compatible with the character of the Town of Marshville,\nthat it accomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it achieves the goals\nidentified in the adopted Town Plan 2035 and other adopted and or approved plans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1 Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Marshville.\nThe detached house building type is generally found in residential neighborhoods,\nalthough it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in commercial or\nmixed-use areas. Where possible, structures should be designed to maintain a\nharmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance. Where\nappropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. For\ndetached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive, building placement and site\nplanning shall be dictated by landscape features and landscape preservation. Within\nthe limits described below and unless the zoning district standards require greater\nmeasures, these regulations shall apply to all houses built in the Town of Marshville.\nThe photographs of detached single-family houses in the Carolinas below are\nexamples for illustration purposes only and not intended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\nMarshville Development Ordinance - Article 9 Page 1\n"}, {"page": "41", "text": "9.2-2 Detached House Lot Type.\n(A.)
