The purpose\nof these definitions is to make clear that any such defined use is not permitted under this\nOrdinance.\nB. The listings of permitted uses in the various districts in this Ordinance are considered to be\nspecific in regard to the types of uses intended for each of the various districts. In determining\nproposed uses, the Administrator shall classify the form and function of the use. When a\nproposed use is not specifically listed in the Permitted Uses Table, the Administrator shall\ndetermine if the use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use in form and function.\nIf the Administrator finds that the proposed use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a\n4-6\nMINERAL SPRINGS\n"}, {"page": "130", "text": "ARTICLE 4.

If the Administrator\nfinds that a proposed use is not the same as, or is not manifestly similar to, a listed use, he or\nshe shall classify the proposed use as not permitted. In order to assist the Administrator in\ninterpretation of the Use Matrix, the Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) shall be\nused to determine if a use is similarly material to a use in the Permitted Uses Table.\nC. Two (2) or more principal uses may occupy the same land or building as long as each use is\na permitted use. In determining what is a principal use, the principal use shall be considered\nas the primary purpose or function that a lot or structure services or is proposed to serve. An\naccessory use shall be considered a structure or use that:\n1. Is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with a principal building or\nuse;\n2. Is subordinate to and serves a principal building or a principal use;\n3. Is subordinate in area, extent, or purpose to the principal building or principal use served;\n4. Contributes to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of occupants, business, or industry\nin the principal building or principal use served; and\n5. Is located on the same lot and zones the same as the principal building or use served.\n4.3.3 PERMITTED USES TABLE\nThe following is a list of the meanings of table entries:\nA. \"P\" indicates that the use is permitted by right in the zoning district.\nB. \"S\" indicates that the use is permitted with a Special Use Permit in the zoning district.\nC. A blank space under a zoning district column indicates that a use is not permitted in that\ndistrict.\nD.

Wireless towers may be considered undesirable with other types of uses,\nmost notably residential, therefore special regulations are necessary to ensure that any\nadverse affects to existing and future development are mitigated.\nB. Towers and Facilities\nIf it is determined that telecommunications providers cannot (I) provide an adequate\nservice level from co-locating on an existing telecommunications tower, (II) locate on an\nexisting electric utility transmission tower or similar structure, or (III) locate camouflaged\nantennae within an existing structure; then telecommunications towers and facilities may\nbe allowed as a conditional use in all zoning districts, subject to the following regulations\nin addition to applicable requirements set forth elsewhere in this Ordinance:\n1. In all zoning districts. Towers shall be of a monopole design and construction. All\nmonopoles must be designed to 'telescope' or collapse inward unless documentation\ncan be provided to prove that such design is not feasible.\n2. The maximum allowable height of a tower is 199.9 feet. A greater height may only be\ngranted if the applicant can prove the maximum height will not allow for the provision\nof adequate service levels (i.e. cannot provide a reasonable level of service in the\narea). The height of the tower or structure shall be the vertical distance measured\nfrom the mean elevation of the finished grade at the front of the structure to the\nhighest point of the structure.\nDEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n4-43\n"}, {"page": "167", "text": "ARTICLE 4.

Towers are prohibited on the top of buildings or structures in all Residential, Business,\nand Mixed Use zoning districts. In the Light Industrial zoning district, towers may be\npermitted on roofs or walls with an approved Special Use Permit after submittal of\na report by a qualified and licensed professional engineer indicating the existing\nstructure's suitability to accept the antenna, and the proposed method of affixing\nthe antennae to the structure. Complete details of all fixtures and couplings, and the\nprecise point of attachment shall be indicated.\n5. Towers on roofs may be allowed when the tower height (I) does not exceed more\nthan 30% of the height of the building, or (II) is no more than 50 feet above the top\nof the building/structure, whichever is less. Towers on roofs or walls shall be screened,\nconstructed, and/or colored to match the structure to which they are attached.\n6.

An access road at least 12\nfeet wide shall be maintained by the property owner and/or the applicant from a public\nstreet to the tower for use by service and emergency vehicles. A minimum separation of\n20 feet is required between accessory structures.\nE. Comply with Federal Radio Frequency Emissions Standards\nThe Town of Mineral Springs recognizes that a tower cannot be prohibited nor can a Special\nUse Permit be denied on the basis of environmental or health concerns relating to radio\nemissions if the tower complies with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards. The\nTown requires that the applicant provide documentation proving conclusively that the\nproposed tower complies with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards. In the\nabsence of such documentation, the Board of Adjustment may solicit technical advice\nat the sole expense of the applicant.\nF. Accessory Structures\nAll accessory structures on the ground which contain switching equipment or other\nrelated equipment should be architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and\nland uses in the zoning district, or otherwise integrated, through location and design, to\nblend in with the existing characteristics of the site to the maximum extent practical. This\ngenerally requires structures with pitched roofs, made of local construction materials,\nsuch as brick, wood, stone, or vinyl lapped siding.\nDEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n4-45\n"}, {"page": "169", "text": "ARTICLE 4.

Minimum setbacks for free standing towers located in the Light Industrial zoning\ndistrict shall be determined by the underlying zoning district. These setback requirements\nare applicable on all sides of the property including any side along the road right-of-\nway, and for all leased areas of a parcel. The purpose of these setback requirements is to\nprevent personal injury or property damage due to ice-fall materials and/or debris from\ntower failure or collapse. For the purpose of establishing setbacks, the measurements\nshall be from the edge of the concrete base on which the tower is located. For towers\nproposed to be located on leased property, the leased area shall fully include the\nsetbacks or collapse zones, whichever is greater. Minimum setback requirements may be\nreduced by the Board of Adjustment to allow the integration of a tower into an existing\nor proposed structure such as a church steeple, electric transmission power line support\ndevice, or similar structure.\nI. Lighting\nTowers having a height of 199.9 feet or less, shall not contain lights or light fixtures for\ngeneral illumination purposes at a height exceeding 15 feet, except as required by FAA\nregulations.

A yield plan shall incorporate the following:\n1. Yield Plans must be prepared with the Sketch Plan and must show all proposed lots, streets,\nrights-of-way, and other pertinent features that would be required for a Sketch Plan for\nconventional developments. Although the Yield Plan must be drawn to scale, it need not\nbe based on a field survey. However, the Yield Plan must be a realistic layout reflecting\na development pattern that could reasonably be expected to be implemented, taking\ninto account the presence of wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes, existing easements or\nencumbrances and, if unsewered, the suitability of soils for subsurface sewage disposal.\n2. Yield Plans shall also reflect that each lot in the subdivision contains a minimum area of\n80,000 square feet in the AR district or 60,000 square feet in the RR district. The Yield Plan\nmust identify the site's primary and secondary conservation lands, as identified in the\nExisting Features Plan as outlined in Section 5.3.4.3, and demonstrate that the primary\nconservation lands could be successfully absorbed in the development process without\ndisturbance, by allocating this area to proposed single-family dwelling lots.\n3.
