Box 2235 Tallahassee, FL 32316\nPurpose and Acknowledgement\nThe purpose of the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) is to raise the standards for development in Gaston County by working with the municipalities to\ndraft an ordinance that promotes more quality, uniformity, and consistency in development standards. To streamline and make the development process\nmore understandable and \"user-friendly\", the UDO combines and integrates all the land use ordinances for Gaston County into one document to include:\nZoning, Subdivision, Manufactured Home Park, Watershed Water Supply, and Flood Damage Prevention. The Street Numbering and Road Naming\nOrdinance is included in the appendix. There may be other ordinances that are applicable to a development proposal that are not part of this document.\nThe UDO addresses general development requirements such as, but not limited to land use/zoning of property; design of commercial buildings; parking\nand circulation design; landscaping and open space designations; allowed signage; subdivision and residential development design; water quality\nprotection; construction concerning flood plains; and the layout of manufactured home parks, etc. The Board of County Commissioners and County\nPlanning Board recognize that the UDO is a dynamic product and will have to be modified from time to time to be in line with changing economic\nconditions, land development patterns, and state regulations. The UDO was developed using the following Guiding Principles and Desired Outcomes:\nConsistent with goals and objectives of Gaston County Comprehensive Plan addressing problems of sprawl patterns of land use;\nDevelop procedures and standards that safeguard Gaston County from undesirable development;\nDevelop design guidelines that promote livable communities, not exclusive ones;\nCreate a UDO that is readable and functional across jurisdictions;\nStreamline the land use approval process; and;\nUpdate elected officials on the progress of the UDO as it is being written.\nThe UDO was proposed and authorized at the direction of the Gaston County Board of Commission with recommendations from the County Planning\nBoard with drafting conducted by the Steering Committee, and Planning and Development Services Staff.

Who is in charge of administering this Ordinance? Who do I contact if I have questions regarding the UDO?\nA. The UDO is administered by the Gaston County Building and Development Services Department. The text of the Ordinance can be found on the\nCounty's website www.gastongov.com You can also call (704)866-3075 for more information on the UDO.\nQ2. How is my property zoned?\nA. All of the County's planning jurisdiction has been divided into a series of \"general\" zoning districts. These districts are classified into one of four\ncategories: residential, commercial, industrial, and office. Numerous \"uses by right\" are included in each district along with other uses that are subject\nto the issuance of a Special Use Permit by the Board of Adjustment.\nMost parcels will be located in one or more overlay zoning districts. Information about Overlay districts can be found in Chapter 7. Overlay district\nboundaries were drawn over defined geographic areas that have features that relate to the particular overlay district, regardless of the underlying\ngeneral zoning. For instance, only parcels that are in a designated flood hazard area will be in the (FH) Flood Hazard Overlay District. Parcels contained\nin an overlay district will be subject to the general and overlay district regulations.\nQ3. - What can I put on my property?\nA. The list of all permitted uses (uses by right), conditional uses, and existing uses are shown in Table 7.1-1. Permitted uses are designated in the table\nwith an \"X\". The Administrator will issue a permit for a permitted use if all other requirements in the UDO have been met for that particular use.\nSpecial uses are denoted with a \"S.\" Special Use Permits are issued by the Board of Adjustment following a quasi-judicial meeting and public hearing\nprocess. Manufactured Home Parks are designated with an \"E\", meaning that it is an existing use and subject to the regulations contained in Chapters\n8 and 14.\nSupplemental conditions or performance criteria may apply to certain uses in certain zoning districts. References to those conditions are shown in\nTable 7.1-1.\nQ4. What if I disagree with the decision made by the Administrator? What are my rights?\nA. Any decision made by the Administrator may be appealed to the appropriate Board. Refer to Table 4.1-1 for details. In making their decision, the\nappropriate Board has the ability to uphold, modify, or overturn the Administrator's decision.\nQ5. Can I petition to get my property rezoned?\nA. Yes, property owners can petition to have their property rezoned in one of two ways. First, a petition can be made to rezone a property to a general\nzoning district. For example, if a property is zoned, (R-1), upon adoption of the UDO, the property owner can petition to have their property rezoned to\nanother general zoning district ((C-1) for instance).\nThe second way to rezone a property is by requesting a Conditional District (CD) Zoning (refer to Section 5.16). Conditional Districts are legislative\nzoning map amendments with site-specific conditions incorporated into the zoning map amendment.\nBoth types of requests will be heard by the Planning Board and the Board of Commissioners at a public hearing. The ultimate decision will be made by\nthe Board of Commissioners.\nQ6. - How do I get my property subdivided?\nA. Chapter 13 regulates property subdivision. There are two (2) different types of subdivisions: minor and major. Minor subdivisions involve five (5) or\nfewer lots and do not require new streets to be built or new public utility connection. Minor subdivisions can be approved by the Subdivision\nAdministrator. All other subdivisions are considered major subdivisions. Major subdivisions are first reviewed by the Technical Review Committee\nabout:blank\n4/316\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\n(TRC). The Gaston County Planning Board makes preliminary plat approval for major subdivisions exceeding fifty (50) lots. A Public Hearing with the Board of\nCommissioners is required for subdivisions exceeding fifty (50) lots. Table 13.8-1 summarizes the approval process for all plats.\nQ7. - What will happen if I violate the Ordinance?\nA. You will receive a notice of violation from the Zoning Administrator and be given a time period to bring your site into compliance. If the violation is\ncorrected within that time period, no further action is necessary. If the violation is not corrected within that time period, you may be subject to a civil\npenalty of $100 per day for each day of violation. Refer to Chapter 18 for more information.\nQ8. - What happens if I am in the middle of developing / building on my property when the UDO becomes effective?\nA. Section 3.4.1 states that developments / buildings / structures approved prior to the effective date of the UDO shall be allowed to proceed so\nlong as their designated permit approval remains valid.\nQ9. - What are some of the major changes regulated by the UDO?\nA. The following is a summary of some of the major changes:\nThe UDO is a unified ordinance. It combines the floodplain, watershed, subdivision, manufactured home park, and zoning ordinances into one\ndocument. Moreover, the UDO is written in a form suitable for adoption by all other municipalities in the County that exercise land use controls.\nThe UDO allows for minor variations to the Ordinance to be handled administratively or through a process less vigorous than seeking a\n\"variance\". Section 5.15 allows the Administrator to administratively approve minor deviations from the standards of the UDO as long as the\nmodification is incidental and does not have a significant impact on adjacent properties.\nThe Table of Uses is \"user-friendly\". All permitted uses for each zoning district is listed in Table 7.1-1; the number of uses has been reduced\nsignificantly and categorized according to the activity of the use; the definition for each use can be found in Table 2.7-1; the development status\n(i.e., permitted, conditional, existing) of all uses is clearly marked in Table 7.1-1.\nCreation of an Urban Standards Overlay District (US). This district will apply in areas of the County that are currently urban in nature or likely to\ndevelop in an urban manner over the next 10-15 years. A number of standards will apply to most new buildings that lie in the Urban Standards\nOverlay District.\nSignage. Signage regulations have been enhanced for aesthetic and safety purposes. Signs for nearly all uses have been standardized within most\nzoning districts. In addition, flexibility (and increased signage allowances) has been given for developments that submit master sign packages and\nfor applicants who propose to use less than the maximum number of permitted signs. No new billboards are allowed. Refer to Chapter 12 for\nsignage requirements.\nLandscaping. Street trees are required for most new developments in the Urban Standards (US) Overlay district (notable exceptions include single-\nfamily residences not in subdivisions). In addition, the Administrator can grant a temporary Certificate of Compliance for uses that do not meet full\nscreening and landscaping requirements at the time of occupancy.\nParking Requirements. Table 10.5-1 shows the off-street parking requirements for all uses. Parking requirements for retail uses are set to one (1)\nspace per three hundred (300) sq. ft. Gross Floor Area (GFA). Uses that provide in excess of 150% of the required amount of parking must receive\napproval of a Minor Modification from the Administrator. Uses that seek to provide less than the required number of parking spaces may do so\nthrough the issuance of a Special Use Permit by the BOA per Section 5.12.\nA\nVariety of New Housing Development Options are provided in the UDO. Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TNDs) are allowed in multiple\nzoning districts. This type allows for the mixture of residential and non-residential uses in a pedestrian-friendly setting. Refer to Section 8.1.13 for\nspecifications. Planned Residential Developments (PRDs) are also allowed in a variety of zoning districts. PRDs allow for a mixture of residential\ntypes (i.e., single- and multi-family) provided that a variety of design standards are met. Refer to Section 8.1.11 for specifications. Infill residential\ndevelopments are allowed within the USO district in areas that are near transit lines, on major or minor arterials, or lie within walking distance of a\nmajor shopping center, office park/industrial park, or other major employer or traffic generator. Infill developments allow for reduced lot sizes and\ndeviations from some standard subdivision requirements. Refer to Section 8.1.12 for specifications. Multi-family Development and density\nrequirements have been modified.\nAccess Management Standards are in place to regulate the number of driveways per lot; distances between driveways; and distances between a\ndriveway and a street intersection. Refer to Section 9.24 and 13.15.4C for specifications.\nSubdivision Standards. (Refer to Chapter 13) The Technical Review Committee (TRC) was created to review and provide comments on all preliminary\nplats for major subdivisions. Open space may be required in subdivisions per Section 11.7. In lieu of open space, a fee may be paid to the County\n(funds from which are to be used exclusively for recreational purposes) per Section 11.7. Within the (US) Overlay district, sidewalks on both sides\nof streets in subdivisions shall be required per Section 13.17.\nabout:blank\n5/316\n"}, {"page": "6", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nConditional District (CD) Zoning is a method for a property owner to rezone their property. Conditional District zoning is a means for ensuring that\na firm development, based on a mutually agreed-upon site plan takes place on the property. The (CD) zoning is a legislative decision rendered\nafter a public hearing is conducted by the governing board. Prior to the public hearing taking place, Public Information Meetings between the\ndevelopers and adjoining and nearby property owners must occur. Conditional District zoning does not require issuance of a Special Use Permit.\nRefer to Section 5.16.5 for more information on Conditional District zoning.\nQ10. Where can I place a manufactured home?\nA. The Use Table in Chapter 7 can be used to verify which zoning districts allow manufactured homes and in what manner.\nQ11. Can I replace my manufactured home? What are the regulations for replacement?\nA.\nYes, manufactured homes may be replaced in accordance with Section 3.5. Manufactured homes within a Manufactured Home Park may be replaced\nin accordance with Section 8.1.8.\nQ12. Will Bona Fide Farms still be allowed?\nA. Yes, Bona Fide Farms are allowed.

Petition withdrawal. An applicant who has submitted a complete application for a Zoning Map amendment may withdraw that application prior to a\nfinal decision being rendered by the Board of Commissioners. Such withdrawal may be made under the following guidelines:\n1. If said petition is withdrawn at least two working days prior to the Board of Commissioners' legislative hearing, a similar application shall not be\naccepted by the Administrator within 180 days of the date of withdrawal.\n2. Otherwise, if said petition is withdrawn less than two working days prior to a final decision being rendered, a similar application shall not be\naccepted by the Administrator within one year of the date of withdrawal.\n3. Notwithstanding the above, the Administrator may allow a similar application to be submitted prior to the expiration of said time periods having\nfirst determined:\na.\nThere has been a significant change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent piece of property;\nb. The Board of Commissioners has adopted a plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the proposed change\nwould be developed;\nC. Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line, or other such facility has occurred to serve the property and can comfortably\naccommodate the proposed zoning classification;\nd. There has been some other extraordinary change in conditions or circumstances, outside the control of the petitioner, which justifies the\nwaiver of said time restrictions. This, however, shall not include a change in property ownership; or,\ne. The proposed Zoning Map amendment is substantially different from that which was previously proposed and, if such amendment were\napproved, would effect a change substantially different than that contained in the previous application.\n4. Notwithstanding the above, any amendment petition initiated by the Planning Board or Board of Commissioners shall be exempt from any time\nrestraints on resubmittal.\nG. Petition Resubmittal. If the Board of Commissioners has denied an application for the rezoning of a parcel of land to a general zoning district, a similar\napplication shall not be accepted by the Administrator for a period of one year following the date of such denial. Notwithstanding, the Administrator\nmay accept such submittal within said one-year period if he makes any one of the findings listed in Section 5.16.3.F.3. of this Ordinance.\nH. Application Submission Period. Any completed application submitted shall be heard by the appropriate Board for approval within 180 days from the\ndate of submittal. After the expiration of an application, a new application may be submitted following the current regulations in place at the time of\nthe new application submittal.\nSec. 5.16.4 - (Removed) Zoning map amendment process-Parallel conditional use districts (PCUP).\nThe parallel conditional use rezoning process has been removed as an option with the adoption of Resolution 2019-247, by the Board of Commission on August\n27, 2019.\nSec. 5.16.5 Zoning map amendments-Conditional districts (CD).\nConditional Districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules,\nregulations, and conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property. A Conditional District zoning\nallows particular uses to be established in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are\nof a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the surrounding area and on the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by\ngeneral district standards. There are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular\nproperty even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted land\nuse plan and other long range plans. It should be interpreted that a Conditional District zoning application be applicable in all underlying zoning districts and\nregulated uses where permitted by right or by Special Use Permit (SUP). When applying for a (CD) where a special use is listed in the Use Table, a Special Use Permit\n(SUP) is not required in addition to the (CD).\nA. Application.\n1. Petitioning for a Conditional District is a voluntary procedure and can be initiated only by the owner(s) of the property(ies) in question or by their\nauthorized agent. Every application for the rezoning of property to a Conditional District must be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale\ncontaining all of the information outlined in Section 5.16.6 of this Ordinance. The Administrator shall schedule a meeting with the applicant, prior\nto any Public Information Meeting (PIM) being advertised and/or held to review the rezoning application and site plan to make sure that it meets,\nall minimum requirements of this Ordinance.\n2.\nNo application shall be considered complete unless it is accompanied by a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule approved by the governing\nboard for the submittal of an application for rezoning to a Conditional District. Said fee shall be waived for any application submitted by any\nofficial or agency acting on behalf of the Gaston County or the State of North Carolina.\n3.\nabout:blank\n103/316\n"}, {"page": "104", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThe Administrator may require the petitioner to submit more than one copy of the rezoning application in order to have enough copies available to circulate to\nother government agencies for review and comment. When dealing with the Conditional District zoning process, it may be desirable to request additional\ninformation in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area. The Planning Board or Board of Commissioners may request\nadditional information as they deem necessary.\n4. The deadline for submittal shall be 45 working days prior to the public meeting with the Planning Board. Applications with proposed projects\ncomprised of 50 acres or more shall have a deadline submittal of 90 working days prior to the public meeting with the Planning Board.\nB.

The applicant shall provide an agenda, schedule, location, and list of participants such as landscape architects, engineers, etc. to answer\nquestions from citizens and service providers for the PIMs in cooperation with the Administrator.\nb. It is recommended that the first PIM last two to four hours, depending on the nature of the proposed development and its location. A\nminimum of one hour should be scheduled during normal business hours to allow service providers and other public agencies (such as public\nworks officials, NCDOT, NCDENR, QNRC, etc.) to participate as needed and to allow for citizens to drop in at a convenient time throughout the\nperiod. It is recommended (but not mandated) that this portion of the PIM take place at the proposed development site.\nIn addition, a second one hour minimum PIM should be scheduled at a conveniently located meeting site agreed upon by the applicant and\nthe Administrator.\nA PIM may last for different amounts of time, depending on the nature of the development, its location, and the number of parties involved\nand/or attending the meeting.\nC. Notice of the PIMs shall be given as follows:\ni. A public notice shall be sent by the applicant to a newspaper having general circulation in the County not less than ten days nor more than\n25 days prior to the date of the PIM.\nii. A notice shall be sent by first class mail by the applicant to the owners of all properties that lie within 200 feet as measured from the\nexterior boundaries of the proposed development.\nThe applicant shall furnish the County with a list of the mailing labels that depict the names and addresses of the owners of all properties\nwithin the said 200-foot area. Such notice shall be sent not less than ten days prior to the date of the PIM. The notification shall contain\ninformation regarding the PIM time and location(s) as well as a general description of the proposal.\niii. With respect to Subsection ii above, the applicant shall provide to the County proof of the paper notice and mailings.\niv. A PIM notification sign shall be posted by the County in a conspicuous place at the property not less than ten days prior to the PIM. The\nsign shall indicate date, time, and location(s) of the PIM. In lieu of any or all of this information to be contained on this posted notice, the\nnotice may give a phone number where interested parties may call during normal business hours to get further information on the PIM.\nd. The Administrator will keep notes of comments received during the PIM. A summary of the comments made shall be included in any staff\nreport prepared by the Administrator relative to the rezoning request.\n2. Following the PIM, the applicant shall have the opportunity to make changes to the application to take into account information and comments\nreceived. One or more revised copies of the application shall be submitted to the Administrator for review. No additional fee shall be required to\nbe paid for making such changes provided the Administrator receives the revised application within seven days following the PIM. If a revised\napplication is not received during said seven-day period, the Administrator shall review the original application submitted.\nC. Administrator approval. The Administrator shall have up to seven days following any revision of the application to make comments. If the\nAdministrator forwards no comments to the applicant by the end of any such seven-day period, the application shall be submitted to the Planning\nBoard for their review without any further comment.\nD. Plans and other information to accompany petition.\n1. Every application for the rezoning of property to a Conditional District requires a site plan, drawn to scale containing all of the information\noutlined in Section 5.16.6 of this Ordinance.\n2. Other information may be required by the Administrator relative to the rezoning request.\nE. Legislative hearing notification requirements.\n1. Before any property is rezoned to a Conditional District, the Planning Board shall have an opportunity to review and make a recommendation on\nthe application. Planning Board review shall take place after the PIMs are completed and a public meeting has been held by the Planning Board.\nNotification of the legislative hearing, which is conducted by the Board of Commissioners, shall be as follows:\na.

If a recommendation is not made during said time period, the application shall\nbe forwarded to the Board of Commissioners without a recommendation.\nG. Action by County Board of Commissioners. A decision pertaining to Conditional Districts is a legislative process subject to judicial review using the\nsame procedures and standard of review as applied to general district zoning decisions. Once the legislative hearing has been held, the Board of\nCommissioners shall take action on the petition. The legislative hearing, once opened, can be continued to a later date and action taken at that time.\nThe Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to:\n1.

In order to achieve the purposes established for this Ordinance as indicated in Section 6.2, and to further the goals and objectives stated in any plans for\nthe future development of Gaston County as adopted by the governing board, a number of zoning districts are hereby created. Districts are divided into\nthe following four categories:\n1. General zoning districts.\n2. Overlay districts.\n3. Parallel conditional use districts (Removed).\n4. Conditional districts.\nB. Each general zoning district category serves a different function. There are several \"residential,\" \"commercial,\", \"office,\" and \"industrial\" zoning districts\nthroughout the County's planning jurisdiction. Most districts allow for various land use types and categories; certain districts allow for and encourage\nmixing land use types.\nC.\nOverlay districts address issues of particular concern and overlay one or more of the general zoning districts. These regulations supplement those found\nin the underlying general zoning district. Any proposed use located within an overlay district would have to meet the requirements of the underlying\ngeneral zoning district and the requirements of the overlay district.\nD. Parallel Conditional Use Districts (PCUP) (REMOVED) were established to consider situations where a particular use may be acceptable on a lot or tract of\nland but the other uses permitted in a General Zoning District would not be acceptable. (NOTE: The parallel conditional use rezoning process has been\nremoved as an option with the adoption of Resolution 2019-247, by the Board of Commission on August 27, 2019. All PCUP applications approved prior to\nthis date will be considered valid and remain as an established zoning district until such time the parallel conditional use permit expires or a different use\nor zoning district is sought for the property.)\nE.\nConditional Districts (CD) create completely new zoning districts to serve the needs of a particular development. This process does not require a quasi-\njudicial hearing of a Special Use Permit. The applicant shall hold two Public Information Meetings (PIMs). Conditional District zonings are a legislative\nprocess type of rezoning. Property owners, or their authorized agents, are the only people who can request a conditional district rezoning.\nSec. 6.2 - General zoning districts.\nSec. 6.2.1 - Residential districts.\nabout:blank\n107/316\n"}, {"page": "108", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nA.\nR-1 Single-Family Limited. This district is to accommodate single family site built homes and modular construction. The minimum lot size allowed in this\ndistrict will be dependent on the provision of public or community water and sewer facilities. Although areas may be served with such utilities, most of\nthese areas are located beyond existing or anticipated utility service coverage areas. The minimum lot size for residential uses in this district is larger than\nin other residential zoning districts.\nB. R-2 Single-Family Moderate. This district is to accommodate single family site built homes, modular construction, and double-wide manufactured homes.\nThe minimum lot size allowed in this district will be dependent on the provision of public or community water and sewer facilities. Although areas may be\nserved with such utilities, most of these areas are located beyond existing or anticipated utility service coverage areas. The minimum lot size for\nresidential uses in this district is larger than in other residential zoning districts.\nC. R-3 Single-Family General.

This district is generally found in the Urban Standards (US) overlay district and is served by at least one public or community water or sewer\nutility. Higher densities than this are normally allowed. A variety of different residential types may be accommodated through Planned Residential\nDevelopments (PRD), Infill Residential Developments, and Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TND) through the satisfaction of certain performance\ndesign and construction.\nG. RMF Residential Multi-Family. This district is intended primarily as a residential district for single-family, two-family, and multi family dwellings, and their\ncustomary accessory uses. This district establishes areas where development patterns are somewhat denser than surrounding areas. To ensure that\ndevelopments are well planned and compatible with adjoining residential uses, density levels of development over eight units per acre are allowed\nthrough the Conditional District zoning process. This district should have access to public or community water and sewer utilities.\nH. RLD Residential Low Density. This district requires the largest standard minimum lot size of two acres (87,210 square feet). This district is designed to\naccommodate residential uses in the most rural portions of the County. This district is protected from large-scale residential development where\nindustrial or intense commercial development is called for on the land development plan in the future, but where specific development plans do not\ncurrently exist. The district may be located both within and beyond the Urban Standards (US) overlay district.\nSec. 6.2.2 Office districts.\nA. TMU Transitional Mixed Use. This district encourages office / mixed office and residential uses at an intensity that compliments nearby residential land\nuses. These areas are most often found in developed, urban portions of the county and within the Urban Standards (US) overlay district. Areas found\nalong major corridors were originally developed for residential areas. However, due to their location, the blending of office uses and higher density\nresidential development have taken place. The TMU district encourages mixed development to continue.\nB. OLC Office/Light Commercial. This district allows for and is designed to accommodate mixed office, retail, and residential development. This higher\nintensity development will most likely occur within the Urban Standards (US) overlay district where public utilities are present and where access to major\nthoroughfares and/or transit is found. Development in OLC areas will most likely be at a higher intensity level than in the TMU district.\nC.\nO-1 Office. This district accommodates larger-scale office developments and complementary commercial service establishments.\nD. O-M Medical Office. This district is designed to accommodate medically oriented uses that lie close to Caromont Regional Hospital or other existing or\nplanned community medical facilities in the County. Complementary uses are encouraged to be located near these medical facilities to better serve the\ngeneral public. Uses that are non-medically related are generally excluded from this zoning district to not compete for space that could otherwise be\ndeveloped for medically related uses. Given the relatively small amount of land suitable for such zoning, predominate uses in other zoning districts (i.e.,\nresidences, non-medically related retail uses) are not allowed in the O-M district.\nSec. 6.2.3 - Commercial districts.\nabout:blank\n108/316\n"}, {"page": "109", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nA.\nCBD Central Business District.

Signage requirements shall be specifically tailored for a downtown setting.\nB. UMU Urban Mixed Use. This district is generally located in the fringes of central business districts and allows for the redevelopment of older commercial\ndistricts in a pedestrian-friendly manner. An Urban Mixed Use area may not represent the true downtown business core of a community. However, it\ncontains development features (i.e., limited or no front yard setbacks, limited amounts of off-street parking) that often pre-date the implementation of\nland use regulations. Redevelopment of such areas, for both commercial and residential purposes, is encouraged.\nC. C-1 Light Commercial. This district accommodates a large variety of retail uses designed to meet the needs of individual neighborhoods or other relatively\nsmall geographic areas. Stores and shopping complexes are relatively small in size and designed to be compatible and integrated with adjoining\nresidential neighborhoods. This zoning district was not created to accommodate retail uses that attract persons from outside the neighborhood or attract\nlarge numbers of passing motorists.\nD. C-2 Highway Commercial. This district accommodates retail services and distributive uses typically located along or adjacent to principal or minor arterials\nand require high visibility, good road access, and which cater primarily to passing motorists. Development in this district is designed to promote\naesthetics and the safe and efficient movement of traffic so as to not unduly burden adjacent thoroughfares. As larger and more intensive developments\ncreate more significant impacts on adjoining neighborhoods, roads, and utility infrastructures, larger developments may be allowed in this zoning district.\nMost (C-2) zoning districts are located within the Urban Standards (US) overlay district.\nE.\nC-3 General Commercial. This district accommodates the broadest array of commercial uses of all the commercial zoning districts, some of which are not\nallowed in any other commercial zoning districts. Like the (C-2) district, the (C-3) district is intended to accommodate the community's larger and most\nintense commercial developments (outside of the central business district) and generally located within the Urban Standards overlay district.\nF.\nNBS Neighborhood Business Services. This district is designed primarily for local retail, offices, and personal services developed at relatively low intensity\nlevels and are compatible with adjoining residential neighborhoods. It is not intended to accommodate retail uses which are designed to attract persons\nfrom outside the neighborhood or to attract large numbers of traveling motorists. Regulations for this district are designed to encourage the development\nof small, neighborhood-oriented retail areas.\nG. GPX Garden Parkway Interchange. This district accommodates an array of aesthetically pleasing and well-designed developments close to interchanges\nalong the Garden Parkway. While developments near the interchange exits may be designed for automobile access and provide amenities to motorists\nusing the Parkway, the district is intended to accommodate mixed residential, retail, service and office uses that are well-integrated, compact, and\npedestrian friendly. This district is not intended to accommodate nor promote typical \"strip commercial\" developments typically found along roads that\nemanate from limited access road interchanges.\nAs indicated in Table 7.1-1, a wide variety of residential, retail, service, and office uses are allowed within the (GPX) district. This district promotes well-designed\ndevelopment that integrates a variety of uses. Lot by lot incremental development of parcels within an individual (GPX) zoning district is NOT recommended. Planned\ndevelopments such as Planned Residential Developments (PRDs), Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TNDs), and Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are\nstrongly encouraged. Individual uses outside of these developments are limited to the following:\n1. Single-Family Dwellings.\n2. Convenience Stores.\n3. Hotels/Motels.\n4. Restaurants without drive-through facilities.\n5. Essential Services, Classes 1, 2, and 4.\nExcept for Single-Family Dwellings and Essential Services, all other uses listed above shall be subject to the issuance of a Special Use Permit.\nFor uses that existed when the (GPX) zoning was placed on a piece of land (i.e., a use shown above, or as a use within a PRD, TND or PUD) any expansion of a\nconforming use will be subject to the issuance of a Special Use Permit. Other uses not specifically listed in Table 7.1-1 as being allowed in the (GPX) district\nor\notherwise allowed as part of a (PRD), (TND), or (PUD) shall be considered \"non-conforming\" and shall be subject to the provisions of Section 3.5.\nSec. 6.2.4 Industrial districts.\nA. 1-1 Light Industrial. This district provides for areas that contain a mix of light manufacturing uses, office parks, and service uses in an attractive setting with\nproper screening and buffering. (I-1) districts should include areas that continue the orderly development and concentration of light industrial uses. Any\nareas rezoned to the (I-1) district following the adoption of this Ordinance shall have direct access to or lie within close proximity of a principal or minor\narterial.\nB. I-2 General Industrial. This district provides for areas of heavier manufacturing and industrial uses that are properly sited, based on the following factors:\nadjacent land uses, access to the transportation network, and the availability of public services and facilities. This district shall provide an environment for\nindustries that are unencumbered by nearby residential or commercial development. (I-2) zoned districts shall be located in areas where conflicts with\nother uses can be minimized to promote orderly transitions and buffers between uses. The (I-2) district provides sites for activities that involve major\ntransportation terminals, and manufacturing facilities that have a greater impact on the surrounding area than industries found in the (I-1) district. (I-2)\nabout:blank\n109/316\n"}, {"page": "110", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\ndistricts should not be located adjacent to any property zoned for residential use, except when mitigating factors (i.e., terrain, buffering, and transportation access)\nare in place to mitigate any potential negative impacts upon the residential areas substantively. Any areas that are rezoned to an (I-2) district following the adoption\nof this Ordinance shall have direct access to or lie in close proximity of a principal or minor arterial.\nC. I-3 Exclusive Industrial. This district provides areas for the most intensive heavy manufacturing and industrial uses that may have impacts such as excess\nnoise, environmental concerns, and extended hours of operation. Uses in this district are minimal and include mining uses, petroleum refining, and\nslaughterhouses. Any areas that are rezoned to an (I-3) district following to the adoption of this Ordinance shall have direct access to or lie near to a\nprincipal or minor arterial.\nD. I-U Urban Industrial. This district is generally found in older portions of the community developed prior to the implementation of zoning regulations.\nThese areas contain older industrial and warehouse-type uses and often do not conform to the parking, bulk, or setback requirements applicable if those\nstructures were developed today. The district accommodates existing uses encourages the redevelopment of such uses for industrial, commercial, and\nresidential purposes.\nSec. 6.3 - Overlay zoning districts.\nSec. 6.3.1 FH Flood Hazard Overlay District.\nThis district promotes public health, safety, and general welfare. The (FH) overlay district minimizes public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood-\nprone areas.\nSee Chapter 16 for the Flood Hazard Regulations.\nSec. 6.3.2 WS Water Supply Watershed Overlay District.\nThis district is designed to protect the water quality of the streams in the water supply watershed that lie within the County's jurisdiction. This Ordinance provides\nregulations that implement the North Carolina Division of Water Quality rules, pursuant to NC General Statute 143-214.5.\nSee Chapter 15 for the Water Supply Watershed Regulations.\nSec. 6.3.3 Reserved.\nSec. 6.3. - SV Scenic View Overlay District.\nThis district protects the scenic views from within the Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden. The Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden is a major asset to economic\ndevelopment, tourism, recreation, and natural resource conservation for Gaston County and the surrounding region. In order to preserve and enhance the natural\nscenery fostered by the Botanical Garden and enjoyed by visitors to the Garden, Gaston County finds it necessary to control the height of structures within the view\nfrom the Garden. Gaston County feels that the erection of tall structures in areas within view of the Botanical Garden can result in the degradation of its natural\nscenic views and thus reduce its attraction as a natural scenic area and a retreat from urban development.\nSec. 6.3.5 TH Thoroughfare Highway Overlay District.\nThis district ensures that development along designated thoroughfares is well planned. At some point in the future, the widening or construction of these roads\nwill take place. To minimize any negative impacts to adjoining property owners occurring due to such widening projects, the (TH) district has been created to require\nthat all new structures lying on properties along these roads be adequately set back from existing and projected road rights-of-way. In this manner, all structures\nbuilt per the (TH) district requirements will be adequately set back from the road when it is widened. The thoroughfare roads are shown on the adopted\nThoroughfare Map, not the official Zoning Map. Thoroughfare roads are addressed when a development is submitted for review.\nSec. 6.3.6 US Urban Standards Overlay District.\nThis district provides for areas of the County located outside their corporate limits and municipal Extra Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ), but where the provision of\npublic water and sewer services can reasonably be expected to occur over the next 10-15 years. This district calls for standards traditionally found in urban areas as\nopposed to rural areas. Standards addressed include, but are not limited to: building design, off-street parking, road, lot, and subdivision standards.\nNote: If any portion of the subject property is within the (US) district, then the entire property shall be developed in accordance with (US) standards.\nSec. 6.3.7 Reserved.\nSec. 6.3.8 - WF Waterfront Overlay District.\nThis district provides supplemental restrictions to protect and enhance water quality, public safety, and public recreational opportunities on the Catawba River\nand its waterways. This District covers the surface waters of the Catawba River and its waterways and all land areas within 1,000 feet of these shorelines. The\nshoreline shall be measured at the mean high water mark (i.e., the 570-foot contour level for Lake Wylie) of the Catawba River and said waterways.\nabout:blank\n110/316\n"}, {"page": "111", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nSec. 6.3.9 Reserved.\nSec. 6.3.10 - SH Special Highway Overlay District.\nThis district protects and preserve the landscape of areas that lie adjacent to designated Special Highways. Development that takes place on land near highways\nshall maximize the aesthetics and development potential of the area through the application of additional development standards. The (SH) district shall consist of\nall lots fronting on the Special Highway for a depth of 500 feet as measured from the centerline of the Special Highway for a total width of 1,000 feet, unless\notherwise indicated on the Zoning Map.\nSec. 6.3.11 - CH Corridor Highway Overlay District.\nThis district preserves and enhances the streetscape along designated corridor highways in Gaston County. A (CH) district may exist along the entire length of a\nroadway or any identifiable segment of a roadway. Any (CH) District initially established shall contain a minimum length of at least 1,000 linear feet as measured\nalong one side of a designated corridor highway. The (CH) district shall consist of all lots fronting on the corridor highway for a depth of 250 feet as measured from\nthe centerline of the corridor highway for a total width of 500 feet, unless otherwise indicated on the Zoning Map. Although such corridor highways may vary in\ncharacter, particular aspects of development along those roads raise common concerns and should be managed in a consistent way in order to preserve and\nenhance the streetscape.\nSec. 6.3.12 - GP Garden Parkway Overlay District.\nThis district maintains an aesthetic viewshed for motorists and landowners along the length of the Garden Parkway. Any (GP) Overlay district initially established\nshall contain a minimum depth of at least 1,000 linear feet and shall consist of all lots fronting along the Garden Parkway for a depth of 500 feet on each side of the\nGarden Parkway as measured from the centerline of the Garden Parkway. The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to modify the initial or subsequent\nplacement of the (GP) Overlay district boundaries on a case-by-case basis.\nSec. 6.4 Parallel conditional zoning (PCUP) districts.\nParallel conditional use districts were established (prior to their removal as a rezoning process option with the adoption of Resolution 2019-247, by the Board of\nCommission, on August 27, 2019) to consider situations where a particular use may be acceptable on a lot or tract of land but the other uses permitted in a general\nzoning district would not be acceptable.\nSec. 6.5 - Conditional District (CD) zoning.\nThe Conditional District (CD) zoning process allows for the establishment of specific uses that, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both\nthe immediate area and the community as a whole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district standards. Section\n5.16.5 outlines the process for approval of a (CD) district. The rezoning of any parcel of land to a (CD) district shall be a voluntary process initiated by the property\nowner or their authorized agent. Any area rezoned to a (CD) district shall be in general compliance with the goals, objectives, and implementation strategies of the\nadopted Comprehensive Land Use Plan and all other plans and regulations officially adopted by the Board of Commissioners. This review process provides for the\naccommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a (CD) district, subject to specific conditions (which may exceed those that would otherwise be\nrequired for the use in question), to ensure compatibility of the use with the enjoyment of neighboring properties and in accordance with the general plans of\ndevelopment of the County. A Conditional District zoning is not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal.\nOnce a property has been rezoned to a (CD) district, it shall be referenced with the letters \"CD\" in front of the name of the applicable general zoning district listed\nin Section 6.2. For example, a property rezoned to a (C-2) Conditional District shall appear on the Zoning Map as \"(CD/C-2).\"\nChapter 7 USE AND BUILDING LOT STANDARDS\nSec. 7.1 - Table of uses/uses not expressly listed or addressed.\nA. Table 7.1-1 shows the principal uses that are allowed in each zoning district. Supplemental regulations are discussed in Chapter 8; Parking Requirements\nare discussed in Chapter 10. Other district regulations may apply which are not expressly listed in this Chapter, such as Flood Plain, Watershed Water\nSupply, etc.\nCertain uses predating the adoption of this Ordinance are allowed to remain as nonconforming uses in accordance with Chapter 3 of this Ordinance. Unless a use\nis allowed as a \"permitted,\" \"conditional,\" \"nonconforming use,\" \"temporary use,\" \"Special Use Permit\" per Section 5.12, or otherwise specifically addressed in this\nOrdinance, then such use shall be expressly prohibited in that zoning district. The Board of Adjustment shall have no authority to grant a variance or Special Use\nPermit to allow for such prohibited use.\nB. Table 7.1-1 lists the allowed uses and in the zoning district in which they are permitted in accordance with the following letter designations:\nX = Permitted use by right\nCD = Conditional Zoning required\nabout:blank\n111/316\n"}, {"page": "112", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nE = Existing use subject to limitations\nSP = Special Use Permit required\nS = supplemental regulations listed in addition to X, CD, E, SP\nNote: The supplemental regulations list more in depth how a use is allowed if a supplemental number is noted in the Table of Uses.\nThe Conditional District (CD) zoning designation is applicable in all underlying zoning districts and regulated uses, and therefore, may not be indicated\nthroughout the entire Table of Uses but should be presumed allowable when permitted by right or Special Use Permit (SUP).\nSec. 7.2 - Table of uses category description.\nA.

If such use is a Special\nUse Permit, the Board of Adjustment may attach fair and reasonable conditions which would serve to mitigate any existing nonconforming situations arising from\nsuch conversion.\nSec. 7.5 - Bulk and dimensional standards.\nBulk and dimensional standards for all uses in all general zoning districts are shown in Tables 7.1-2 through 7.1-5. Such dimensional standards shall apply unless\nspecific more restrictive standards for individual uses are found elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nAdditional setbacks shall be required on corner lots and

The following is a summary of the guiding principles of a (TND):\n1. Principles of Public Realm.\na. Well-designed places; terminal vistas.\nb. Non-residential buildings near or at the sidewalk.\nC. Lots are typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions.\nd. Rear access alleys allowed.\n2. Principles of Transportation System.\na. Connected web of streets.\nb. Culs-de-sac are to be avoided and, where permitted, are short in length.\nC. Curved as well as straights streets may be provided.\nd. Short blocks.\ne. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street.\nf. Two or more points of ingress and egress are provided for the (TND).\n3. Principles of Mixed Use.\na. (TNDs) always contain a mixture of dwelling types (e.g., single-family detached, single-family attached, multi-family, dwellings atop of commercial\nuses, etc.).\nb. Denser housing is found near a designated \"TND Center\".\nC. Civic uses are encouraged within the (TND).\nd. Similar types of buildings should face each other on opposite sides of the street.\n4. Principles of Architecture.\na. Commercial buildings should be of the \"shop-front\" variety that cater to the pedestrian.\nb. Other non-residential uses within the TND should also be designed so as to cater to pedestrians.\n5. Principles of the (TND) Center.\na. Each (TND) must have at least one neighborhood center (i.e., TND Center) as a focal point of the community.\nb. The (TND) center is \"ideally\" located in the geographic center, although there may need to be some variation to this theme to insure that the\ncenter is viable. In certain instances, a nearby, established, and pedestrian-oriented center located outside the (TND) may serve as an alternative.\nC. The (TND) Center shall consist of one or more uses that serve the residents of the (TND) and can include retail, office and civic uses.\nd. With limited exceptions (i.e., financial institutions, ATMs), commercial uses should not be automobile oriented.\n6. Principles of Open Space.\na. Compact development should result in preservation of open space.\nb. (TNDs) shall have public open spaces such as greens, village squares, parks or playgrounds.\nC.

All\nmonopoles shall be designed to \"telescope\" or collapse inward unless documentation can be provided to prove that such design is not feasible.\nIn all Commercial and Industrial (except (I-U)) districts, a monopole which is designed to \"telescope\" or collapse inward is preferred by the County. If\nthe applicant can demonstrate that a monopole cannot provide adequate service or structural integrity, then a lattice construction steel structure\ntower is acceptable. If a lattice tower is necessary, then it must be one that is designed to collapse inward upon itself.\nNewly proposed telecommunication towers are prohibited in the Scenic View (SV) Overlay District.\nB. It is the intent of the County to encourage providers to co-locate facilities in an effort to reduce the number of telecommunication towers in Gaston\nCounty. New telecommunication towers shall be capable of supporting additional communications antennas. Prior to completing an application for a\ntelecommunication tower, the applicant shall provide to the County evidence of negotiation in good faith with other providers to lease space at a\nreasonable cost and for reasonable terms, and to publicize the fact that space is available on a lease basis as part of the Special Use Permit process.\nC.\nThe maximum allowable height of a tower is 199.9 feet. No increase to the height may be granted unless the applicant can prove the maximum height\nwill not provide an adequate service level (i.e. cannot provide a reasonable level of service in the area). The height of a tower or structure shall be the\nvertical distance measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade at the front of the structure to the highest point of the structure.\nD. Where a telecommunication tower is located on a lot with an existing principal use, the tower shall be located in the rear yard only. In addition, an\naccess road of at least 12 feet wide shall be maintained by the property owner and/or the applicant from a public street to the tower for use by service\nand emergency vehicles.\nE. Towers are prohibited on the top of buildings or structures in all the Residential, Office and (I-U) zoning districts as well as the Scenic View (SV) Overlay\nDistrict. In Commercial and Industrial (except (I-U)) zoning districts, towers may be placed on roofs or walls with an approved Special Use Permit after\nsubmittal of a report by a qualified and licensed professional engineer indicating the existing structure's suitability to accept the tower and the\nproposed method of affixing the tower to the structure. Complete details of all fixtures and couplings, and the precise point of attachment shall be\nindicated.\nTowers on roofs may be allowed when the tower height:\n1. Does not exceed more than 30 percent of the height of the building or is no more than 50 feet above the building/structure, whichever is less.\n2. Towers on roofs or walls shall be screened, constructed, and/or colored to match the structure to which they are attached.\nF. The County recognizes that a telecommunications facility (the original tower and antennae provider as well as any co-location entities) cannot be\nprohibited nor can a Special Use Permit be denied on the basis of environmental or health concerns relating to radio emissions if the\ntelecommunications equipment and facility complies with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards. The County requires that each applicant\nshall provide documentation proving that their telecommunications equipment complies with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards.\nG. A minimum eight-foot high chain link fence is required immediately around the telecommunications tower and any equipment building(s) since the\ntower can be considered an attractive nuisance. Barbed wire, razor wire, or other similar types shall be used along the top of the fence and access to\nthe tower area and equipment buildings shall be through a locked gate. The Zoning Administrator may waive fencing requirements for stealth towers\nand other types of structures if the fencing serves no useful purpose.\nNote: Applicants building new towers shall plan the fence and screening (see below) to accommodate all future providers on the site such that the\nfence and screening materials surround the land designated for all future equipment buildings and the tower.\nH. Landscape screening shall be required along the outside area of the perimeter fenced area(s) to mitigate the visual impacts of the tower and\nequipment buildings from nearby viewers. Landscape materials shall consist of evergreen shrubs planted in accordance with Type B buffer, with a five\nfeet planting strip (see Section 11.3). Evergreen shrubs should be of a size expected to reach a minimum of six feet in height at maturity. Trees may be\nevergreen or deciduous. All landscaping shall be drought tolerant or irrigated to ensure good health and vitality.\nThe installation and maintenance requirements of Section 11.1.2(E) shall apply.\nScreening requirements shall not apply to telecommunications providers who camouflage (stealth towers) towers or antennas within another\nstructure (such as a bell steeple), or co-locate on an existing tower. Nor shall screening apply when an antenna will be mounted on an electrical\ntransmission tower or on structures such as a water tower/tank, grain silos, etc. or similar structures.\nabout:blank\n193/316\n"}, {"page": "194", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThe Administrator may waive any or all of the screening requirements upon determining existing topography or existing natural conditions on site will\nscreen the property as effectively as the required screening, provided that the spirit and intent of this subsection are met.

Such a waiver may not be sought to\nrelieve the screening requirement for towers to be located adjacent to vacant properties or along any public right-of-way. Undevelopable property\nshall constitute any such property or land that is unable to be used as a building site.\nI. Minimum setback requirement, on all sides of the property including road right-of-way, or leased area of a parcel, shall be 0.75 foot for every one foot\nof actual tower height (i.e. a 199.9 foot tower would require a 149.9 foot setback on all sides), or the documented collapse zone, whichever is greater\nin all zoning districts in which telecommunication towers are allowed. This requirement shall not be applicable to a telecommunication tower\nproposing to locate in the (C-3) and Industrial (except (I-U)) zoning districts. These setback requirements are established to prevent ice-fall materials\nand/or debris from tower failure or collapse from damaging off site property.\nSetbacks for free standing towers in the (C-3) and Industrial (except (I-U)) districts setbacks shall be determined by the underlying zoning district.\nSetbacks for towers located within leased areas shall be measured to the edge of the parcel in which the leased area is located.\nJ.

Telecommunications providers who are leasing a portion of a lot for the proposed telecommunication tower shall obtain a written signed certification\nfrom the property owner that no future development or subdivisions of land of leased portions will be made within the established setbacks of the\ntelecommunication tower until such tower is removed from the site (i.e. is abandoned and removed by the provider). This does not apply to\ntelecommunication providers seeking to co-locate on an existing tower.\nL. Towers and related facilities must be removed by the applicant and/or tower owner upon abandonment of the tower (no longer used for its original\nintent) for a period of 365 consecutive days. Such removal (clearing from site) shall take place and be fully completed within 90 days of the first day\nthe tower was declared to have been abandoned for 365 days. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant or tower owner to notify the County when\nthe tower has been abandoned for a period of 365 days.\nM. Any planned increase in tower height to an existing approved telecommunication tower requires the provider to apply for an amendment to the\noriginal Special Use Permit. Normal maintenance and repair of the structure can be completed without the issuance of a new permit at the discretion\nof the Administrator. Planned height increases for towers which were constructed prior to the adoption to the Gaston County Zoning Ordinance\nand/or do not have a Special Use Permit on file with the County shall be required to apply for a Special Use Permit, which includes a review and\napproval by the County.\nN.\nApplications by providers to use co-location space on an approved existing tower shall be permitted by right provided that the tower height is not in\nincreased. If the co-locator or owner of the tower proposes to increase the tower's height, this shall require the co-locator or owner to apply for an\namendment to the original Special Use Permit, which includes a new review and approval by the County. Co-location applicants must comply with all\nrequirements provided in Section 8.4.24, unless provided by the original Special Use Permit applicant.\nO. Free-standing signs are prohibited. Wall signs shall be limited to (i) identification signage allowed on equipment structures or fences surrounding the\ntelecommunication tower/structure provided it does not exceed nine square feet in size for the purpose of identifying the owner of said tower, and\nco-location availability, and (ii) \"No trespassing\" signs, \"Danger High Voltage\" signs, and other similar warning signs shall be installed to discourage\ntrespassing by unauthorized persons.\nSigns shall be on installed and/or mounted on the perimeter fence, and or on tower at the base of the tower.\nNo advertising signs shall be allowed on the tower.\nP.

To direct the location of communication towers within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance;\nabout:blank\n204/316\n"}, {"page": "205", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\n2. To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of telecommunications towers;\n3. To minimize visual impacts of telecommunications towers through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging\ntechniques;\n4. To accommodate the need for telecommunication towers serving residents and businesses of the County;\n5.\nTo promote the shared use/co-location of existing and new communication towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-\nuse towers;\n6. To consider the public health and safety aspect relating to telecommunication towers; and avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower\nfailure and other occurrences through structural standards and setbacks, engineering and careful siting of telecommunication towers.\nC. Refer to Table 7.1-1 for the zoning districts where Telecommunications Towers and Facilities are allowed, provided that the supplemental regulations\ncontained in Chapter 8 and other applicable provisions set forth elsewhere in Ordinance are met, and a Special Use Permit, if necessary, has been issued\nin accordance with Section 5.11.\nD. Freestanding monopole towers, with a maximum height of 199.9 feet are allowed by right in (C-3), (I-1), (I-2), and (I-3) zoning districts provided all other\napplicable provisions set forth herein and elsewhere in this Ordinance are met. Towers with a height of 200 feet or greater and all lattice towers in these\nzoning districts shall be subject to the issuance of a Special Use Permit.\nE. Telecommunication towers can be denied on the basis of negative influence on property values or on aesthetic concerns provided that there is evidence\nto prove the impact on adjacent property owners will be significant. In accordance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the County must clearly state\nthe reasoning and available evidence of the impact on adjacent property values if the request is denied on this basis.\nF.\nTelecommunication towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses in any zoning district where a tower is allowed to be located. A different\nexisting use or an existing structure on the same lot and/or parcel shall not alone preclude the installation of antennae or tower on said lot or parcel.\nG.\nThe replacement of an existing tower of the same tower type, provided the original tower height is not increased, shall be permitted by right in any zoning\ndistrict. The replacement tower shall be located in the same footprint or within 100 feet of the original tower (and on the same lot as the original tower). If\nthe replacement tower is not located on the same footprint, then the replacement tower shall meet the underlying zoning district setbacks and applicable\nscreening requirements. The dismantling and/or removal of the original tower and its associated equipment shall be removed and cleared from the site\nprior to a certificate of compliance being issued from the County for the replacement tower. Co-location requirements as specified in Section 8.4.22, shall\napply to any replacement tower.\nH. Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities, Supplemental.\n1. Siting: To protect the unique aesthetics of the County, to minimize new visual, aesthetic, and public safety impacts, and to reduce the need for\nadditional antenna-supporting structures, the County prefers that small wireless facilities be located outside the public right-of-way; collocated on\nexisting utility poles or wireless support structures; concealed; and have their accessory equipment mounted on the utility ole or wireless support\nstructure. These preferences are intended as guidance for development of an application for small wireless facilities.\n2. Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities: Collocation of small wireless facilities on land used as single-family residential property or vacant land that is\nzoned for single-family development, and any small wireless facility that extends more than ten feet above the utility pole, County utility pole, or\nwireless support structure on which it is collocated, are subject to this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, replacement of an existing streetlight\nfor which the County's financially responsible with a streetlight capable of including a collocated, concealed small wireless facility is permitted on land\nused as single-family residential property or vacant land that is zoned for single-family development.\n3.\nAn abandoned small wireless facility shall be removed within 180 days of abandonment.\n4.

Except as exempted in Subsection 3. below, sidewalks shall be placed in the following locations:\na. Along the abutting side of principal or minor arterial streets.\nb. Along one side of new and existing collector and local streets. When determining if a sidewalk is required on a particular side of the street, the\nAdministrator shall review such criteria as the pattern of existing sidewalks, the location of existing right-of-way, and expected pedestrian\npatterns. Sidewalks may be required on both sides of a collector or local street if one or more of the following conditions exists:\n(i) The current or projected average daily traffic volume is greater than 8,000 vehicles per day.\n(ii) The posted speed limit is greater than 35 miles per hour.\n(iii) The street is a strategic pedestrian route to an existing or planned pedestrian destination, such as a school, park, recreational or cultural\nfacility, greenway trail (or similar amenity), retail commercial site, restaurant, or a multi-family development of ten or more units, located\nwithin a one-quarter mile, as measured along the street centerline.\n(iv) Other pedestrian safety, access, or circulation needs are identified.\nC.

A minimum three-foot greenstrip shall be required to be placed inward between the edge of the curb and the sidewalk. A greenstrip shall not be required\nif the abutting street does not contain either a curb or sidewalk. In no case shall a greenstrip be required to be placed along and parallel to a publicly\nmaintained alley. (See Section 9.18.1(A) for an illustration for this requirement.)\nB. Greenstrips shall be provided along streets with curbs and sidewalks in any planned unit development PUD or traditional neighborhood development\nTND, irrespective of whether the PUD is or is not within the (US) district.\nC.\nThe Administrator, or plat approval body, shall have the authority to waive or modify the greenstrip requirements herein stated on a case-by-case basis\nwhere he determines that the placement of a greenstrip would serve no public purpose and/or the greenstrip would not be in keeping with adjacent\ndeveloped areas along the same street. Examples where such requirements may be found include:\n1. The site is on a street where other adjacent or nearby developed lots that do not contain greenstrips;\n2. The street is within an infill residential development or TND and the lack of a greenstrip would achieve a better layout and design and would support\npedestrian activity and access;\n3.\nThere are unique topographic and physical characteristics associated with the site that would severely restrict placement and/or long-term\nmaintenance of the greenstrip; or,\n4. The presence of public utilities (either above or below ground) would affect the long-term maintenance and upkeep of the greenstrip.\nSec. 9.18.3 Curb/gutter.\nA.

Should such a dedication be required in association with a plat approval, density credits may be\nused, in a manner as provided herein, on the remaining portions of the tract(s) in question. The granting of such density credits shall be made by the Planning\nBoard. The application of density credits shall not affect whether a use, is allowed or not on that lot. Such use shall remain governed by the list of permitted (and, if\napplicable, special) uses for that particular zoning district as listed elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nSec. 9.19.2 Definitions.\nThe following terms are to be used in computing and applying density credits:\nabout:blank\n209/316\nCELL (1, 1): \nTERM\nCELL (1, 2): \nDEFINITION\nCELL (2, 1): \nA1\nCELL (2, 2): \nEntire area of land to be dedicated for thoroughfare right-of-way purposes per the thoroughfare plan, if access to such\nthoroughfare is not permitted (e.g., a limited access highway).\nCELL (3, 1): \nA2\nCELL (3, 2): \nIf direct access to the thoroughfare is allowed, the difference between the area of land dedicated for right-of-way purposes\n(per the thoroughfare plan) and that which normally would be required per the Subdivision Regulations.\nCELL (4, 1): \nB\nCELL (4, 2): \nArea of tract prior to right-of-way dedication.\nCELL (5, 1): \nC\nCELL (5, 2): \nB- (A1 or A2) (i.e., land in tract remaining after dedication is made).\n"}, {"page": "210", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nSec. 9.19.3 - Right-of-way dedication.\nPer G.S. 136-66.10, the Planning Board may grant density credits whenever right-of-way dedication, in accordance with the thoroughfare plan, is required for a\ntract of land located within the planning jurisdiction of the County, and such tract is proposed for subdivision or use of land pursuant to a zoning permit.\nRight-of-way dedication may be so required by the Planning Board where a subdivision, as herein defined, occurs or in situations where land subdivision is not\ninvolved, when the Planning Board determines that:\n1. Said dedication does not result in the deprivation of all reasonable use of the original tract; and,\n2. The dedication is reasonably related to the traffic generated by the proposed use of land, or the impact of dedication is mitigated by other measures\nincluding the use of density credits, as herein prescribed, on contiguous land owned by the subdivider.\nIf the full width of the thoroughfare for which land is to be dedicated is completely contained within the tract of land to be used or developed, up to 100 percent\nof the right-of-way needed to construct or enlarge the thoroughfare on that tract shall be provided. If a portion of such thoroughfare is located on the property\nproposed to be subdivided or developed, the corresponding proportion of land on that tract may be required to be developed.\nDedication of land, as provided herein, shall be offered to the public. Proof, in the form of an instrument having been recorded in the Register of Deeds office, of\nsuch dedication having been made shall be furnished to the Administrator prior to the issuance of any zoning permit that incorporates the use of density credits.\nAny land so dedicated shall substantially be that as needed for the thoroughfare right-of-way in question as shown on the thoroughfare plan.\nSec. 9.19.4 - Density credit formula.\nThe following formula shall be used in applying density credit bonuses:\nA. Single-Family (Including Lots Containing Individual Manufactured Homes) and Two-Family Lots. The density credit bonus is derived by dividing the area\ndedicated for thoroughfare purposes (A1) or (A2) by the area of the entire tract and then multiplied by 100 (i.e., (A1 or A2/B) x 100). The resulting\nfigure may be used on a percentage-by-percentage basis to reduce minimum lot sizes up to a maximum of 25 percent.\nFor example, if the tract in question was 50 acres in area and five acres was to be used for right-of-way dedication purposes, and upon which direct\naccess were not involved (i.e., Garden Parkway), the minimum lot size in the subdivision could be reduced by ten percent [(5/50) X 100 = 10]. Thus, if\nthe tract were located in a zoning district with a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet, lots in the subdivision could be reduced to as low as 9,000\nsquare feet.\nB.\nMulti-Family Developments and All Other Developments Where Density is Measured on a Unit-Per-Acre Basis. The density credit bonus (A1 or A2/B)\nshall be multiplied by the maximum density level (F) in the underlying zoning district. The resulting figure is then added to (F) and then multiplied by\n(C), the remaining developable land in the tract once the right-of-way dedication has been made. In no case may the subsequent density level be\nraised by more than 25 percent over that level which is normally allowed in the underlying zoning district. Irrespective of the use of density credits, all\nyard, height, parking, and setback requirements as stated in this ordinance are to be observed.\nFor example, on a tract of land that was 50 acres in area and if five acres of land were to be dedicated for right-of-way purposes, the density bonus\nwould amount to ten percent (5/50). If the normal maximum density level in this district were eight units per acre, the density bonus would allow the\nmaximum density level to increase to 8.8 units per acre .10) + 8 = 8.8].\nC.\nOther Nonresidential Developments. The area to be computed for the density credit shall be determined (A1 or A2) and shall be divided by 330 square\nfeet. The resulting figure shall represent the maximum reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces to be provided. In no case may\nthis reduction constitute greater than ten percent of the required number of off-street parking spaces.\nSec. 9.20 Hours of operation.\nHours of operations for all office/commercial services/retail uses located in a residential zoning district shall be from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Eastern Standard\nTime, unless otherwise specifically listed elsewhere in this Ordinance. If a use seeks to operate outside of these hours of operations, a minor modification shall need\nto be granted by the Zoning Administrator.\nSec. 9.21 - Uses with outdoor speakers.\nAll uses with outdoor speakers shall locate the speaker and associated drive through window and stacking lane, if applicable, 75 feet or more feet from the edge\nabout:blank\n210/316\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nD\nCELL (2, 2): \nMinimum lot size requirement prior to application of density credit bonus.\nCELL (3, 1): \nE\nCELL (3, 2): \nMinimum lot size after application of density credit bonus (\"A1 or A2/B\" X \"D\").\nCELL (4, 1): \nF\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum multifamily units per acre without density credit bonus.\n"}, {"page": "211", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nof a lot located in a Residential zoning district.\nSec. 9.22 Odor.\nA. Every use of land shall be operated in such a way that regularly recurring odors are not disturbing and do not cause injury, detriment or nuisance to any\nperson of ordinary sensitivities.\nB. Every nonresidential use in an Office, Commercial or Industrial District which adjoins a Residential District must be operated in such a way that any odor\nwhich may be detected by the human senses at the district boundary line is similar in character to odors which could be expected to be generated in\nthose Residential Districts.\nSec. 9.23 Noise.\nEvery use of land shall be operated in such a way that regularly recurring noises are not disturbing or unreasonably loud and do not cause injury, detriment, or\nnuisance to any person of ordinary sensitivities.

The purpose of this section is to enhance and further support the implementation of the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) of the Gaston County,\nNorth Carolina Unified Development Ordinance (UDO).\nA Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) provides information on the projected traffic expected from a proposed development. A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)\nis one of the tools Gaston County, NC employs to ensure development impacts are properly mitigated and the growth is manageable and sustainable. The\nTraffic Impact Analysis (TIA) will be used to inform decision makers regarding rezonings, preliminary plats, and site plans.\nPublic policy makers, citizens, and developers all have a stake in understanding and responding to additional demands on the transportation network. A\nproperly developed Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) can provide the factual basis for more informed decision making and facilitate the timely implementation\nof effective mitigation measure.\nThe main purposes of the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) are:\n1. Identify existing traffic conditions within the study area boundary.\n2. Detect volumes generated by the existing and proposed development on the parcel(s), including the morning peak, afternoon or evening peak, and\naverage annual daily traffic levels.\n3. Identify the distribution of existing and proposed trips through the street network.\n4. Analyze capabilities of intersections located within the study area.\n5. Make recommendations for improvements designed to mitigate traffic impacts and to enhance pedestrian access to the development from the public\nright-of-way.\n6. Include other pertinent information, including but not limited to accidents, noise, and impacts or air quality and other natural resources.\nA development application (rezoning, site plan, and preliminary plat) will not be deemed complete until a final approved Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), if\nrequired, is received and approved by the Gaston County Building and Development Services Director or designee. In addition, applicants should note that\ninteragency and intergovernmental coordination is necessary for projects that impact transportation facilities maintained by State or Municipal\nGovernments.\nB. Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) Process. The first step in the TIA process is the preparation of a scoping report. The report will include a site plan, quantitative\ndescription of the proposed development and land use along with a vicinity map. The scoping report will be used to determine if a TIA is needed and if\nthere are any safety issues associated with the development. The County, a Transportation Consultant for the County, the Applicant, the Gaston-\nCleveland-Lincoln Metropolitan Planning Organization (GCLMPO), and NCDOT staff may participate in this initial step.\nTraffic Impact Analysis (TIA) is required when a proposed development or redevelopment will generate 100 or more new peak hour trips or the total added\nvolume is equal to 1,000 vehicles per day, based on the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, and that\ngenerally would have a significant impact on existing Level of Service (LOS) or anytime, regardless of estimated trip count, at the request of the Subdivision\nAdministrator.\nabout:blank\n212/316\n"}, {"page": "213", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThe Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) must be prepared by a qualified traffic engineer registered in the State of North Carolina and approved by Gaston County.\nThe cost of the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) study shall be paid for by the applicant.\nIf the TIA scope for a proposed project includes roads or property within municipal limits, the municipality shall be provided with TIA drafts for courtesy\nreviews. For projects requiring a TIA, no plan approvals will be provided by Gaston County staff until the TIA is approved by all reviewing agencies. If a\nproposed project requires a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) that impacts a road or roads maintained by the North Carolina Department of Transportation\n(NCDOT), Gaston County staff shall not approve the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) until confirmation of approval of the project's general concept is received\nfrom the NCDOT staff.\nThe Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) must conform to all the requirements in this section and shall be prepared in accordance with the NCDOT current Policy on\nStreet and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways manual. The Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) report must describe and include:\n1. The Study Methodology\n2. The Data Used\n3. The Study Findings\n4. The Recommendations based on the results\nIf the results of a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) demonstrate that a proposed development may overburden the road system based on impacts to the general\nhealth, safety and welfare of the citizens of Gaston County, the Gaston County Building and Development Services Director or designee may impose certain\nconditions to alleviate the negative impacts described by the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA).\nThe following projects shall not be required to submit a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA):\n1. Developments (or phases of) that were approved prior to the effective date of the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) that have maintained valid planned\ndevelopment master plans, preliminary plats, major site plans or conditional use permits. Any additional phases need to be submitted according to\nthe requirements of this section.\n2. Where approved by the Gaston County Building and Development Services Director or designee, redevelopment of any site on which the additional\ntraffic at peak hour represents an increase of less than 100 trips from the previous development, where the redevelopment is initiated within 12\nmonths of the change of use of the previous project.\n3. Minor subdivision, as defined in Chapter 13.\nC. Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) Application Modification. An applicant may modify an application to minimize the traffic-related effects identified in a Traffic\nImpact Analysis (TIA). The applicant may include:\n1. A reduction in the projected vehicle trips per day.\n2. The dedication of additional right-of-way.\n3. The re-routing of traffic and proposed access and egress points.\n4. Participation in the funding of traffic signals or intersection improvements.\n5. Utilization of Public Transit System.\n6. Emerging Technologies.\n7. Other modifications determined to be necessary.\nAll Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) reports must include a statement of compliance with adopted transportation plans, programs, and policies adopted by\nGaston County, Municipalities, NCDOT or GCLMPO for maintaining a safe, reliable, and efficient multi-modal transportation system.\nD. Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) Appeal. Final action on a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) may be appealed to the Gaston County Planning Board.\nThe Gaston County Planning Board may approve the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) if the Board determines that the applicant has satisfactorily mitigated\nadverse traffic effects; or additional traffic from the project has an insignificant effect on Gaston County roads.\nE. Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) Expiration. If a proposed development does not commence in a timely fashion, fully built out within the proposed timeframe,\nor the market dictates a change in land use from what was approved within the Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) document, changes or updates to a previously\napproved TIA may be required. To address these changes and other deviations from approved TIA scopes, these guidelines are provided to determine\nwhen a revised TIA is required.\nAn approved TIA will be considered valid unless:\n1. The build year date is exceeded by more than 12 months.\n2. Road improvements have been constructed within the study area and were not considered in the original TIA or change the distribution of traffic\nwithin the study area.\n3. Road improvements considered in the original TIA that were needed to achieve the targeted Level of Service (LOS) and mitigate the impacts of the\nproposed development or change the distribution of traffic within the study area were not completed within the timeframe projected in the TIA.\n4.\nDevelopment occurs within the study area that is significantly greater than the anticipated background growth (from a rezoning, annexation, etc).\nabout:blank\n213/316\n"}, {"page": "214", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\n5.

A change in use or scale of the development is proposed that may result in an increase in trip generation, a change in traffic distribution, change in\naccess points, or additional impact to a Level of Service (LOS).\nWhen a development's Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) is considered to no longer be consistent with the previously approved scope for one or more of these\nreasons, additional development of the site shall not be approved by Gaston County Building and Development Services Director or designee until a revised\nTIA is approved by all reviewing agencies.\nChapter 10 - PARKING REGULATIONS\nSec. 10.1 - General provisions.\nOff-street parking areas shall be designed to create a safe and comfortable environment for both motorists and pedestrians. Permanent off-street parking spaces\nshall be provided as specified herein for all uses occupying land or facilities (or portions thereof). In certain instances, on-street parking may be counted towards\nmeeting the required number of off-street parking spaces. Such parking spaces may also be provided, in part or in whole, in a parking garage. The requirements of\nthis section shall be met:\nA. At the time a Certificate of Occupancy is issued for a building or structure in which an approved use takes place;\nB. At the time any principal or accessory use or building is enlarged or increased in capacity, such as by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, floor\narea, or other units of measurement [except as herein provided in Section 10.1 (D)] follows; or\nC. Before conversion from one type of use or occupancy to another, or any change in the manner in which the use is constructed that would result in\nadditional parking requirements [except as provided in Section 10.1(D)].\nD. Standards for providing off-street parking spaces, and exceptions thereto, are as follows:\n1. Every new use, or an enlargement, expansion or alteration of an existing use except as herein indicated, shall require off-street parking in\ncompliance with this Chapter.\n2. Except as provided herein, the number of required off-street parking spaces shall be increased when a change of use of either a structure or of\nland requires additional parking spaces in compliance with this Chapter. The number of Parking spaces may be decreased when a change of use\nrequires fewer spaces than was originally provided.\n3.\nThe number of parking spaces shown in Table 10.5-1 for each use represents the required number of off-street parking spaces for such use. The\nnumber of off-street spaces provided on-site or off-site, may be reduced by up to ten percent, upon approval by the Administrator on a case-by-\ncase basis. Allowance for such reduction, or portion thereof, shall be made based on:\na. The nature of the use;\nb. The number of trips anticipated to be generated by the use;\nC. The times of day when the use would likely generate the most number of trips;\nd. The extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and which may reduce the number of vehicle trips required\nbetween different establishments; and,\ne. The availability of nearby on-street or public parking facilities.\n4. A reduction by greater than ten percent may only be granted by variance by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 5.4.\n5. Uses are strongly encouraged to provide off-street parking in keeping with the requirements of Table 10.5-1. The provision of off-street parking\nspaces greater than what is required shall be allowed. If a use seeks to provide off-street parking in excess of 150 percent of what is required in\nTable 10.5-1, a variance must be granted by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 5.14.\n6.\nIf a use is subject to the issuance of a Special Use Permit or Conditional District (CD) zoning request, the granting of the additional off-street\nparking spaces (or reduction of off-street parking) may be included as part of the request for such use.\nE.

Canopy trees shall be planted at a rate of one tree per 30 linear feet of street frontage;\n2. Understory trees shall be planted at a rate of one tree per 30 linear feet of street frontage; and\n3. Evergreen shrubs shall be planted along the face of the parking deck with a maximum spacing of five feet on center.\nD.\nA minimum five-foot wide sidewalk shall be provided with a minimum six-foot wide planting strip between the sidewalk and the adjoining street. Said\nplanting strip shall be maintained with natural ground covers.\nE. If the parking deck has a gated entrance, at least three staging spaces designed for automobiles waiting for admission shall be provided.\nSec. 10.9.2 Parking deck Option B.\nParking decks may be constructed to the following standards, provided that the parking deck is architecturally treated in a manner that avoids a monolithic\nappearance. Treating the facade of the deck as a street wall and articulating it through a variety of building materials shall accomplish this to give the deck a more\npedestrian-friendly character.

Prohibited Uses. The construction of any building or the placement of any mechanical equipment within a buffer yard shall not be permitted except for\nequipment necessary for the provision of utilities. Active recreational uses, such as ballfields, swimming pools and tennis courts, or other active\nstructured recreational uses, or circulation drives or parking lots shall not be allowed within the buffer yard area.\nB. Permitted Uses. The following other uses may be permitted in a buffer yard area provided that none of the required plant material is eliminated, the\nintended screening is accomplished, the total width of the buffer yard is maintained, and all other requirements of this Chapter are met:\n1. Sculpture, outdoor furniture.\n2. Open space areas (provided that none of the uses listed in Subsection A above are located within the buffer yard area).\n3. Walls, fences and driveways connecting to an adjoining property.\nC. Existing Vegetation. Existing healthy vegetation may be counted toward the required buffer yard. The landscape plan submitted for approval shall indicate\nthe number, type, size and location of such plant materials. Existing vegetation that the Administrator deems \"unhealthy\" and not likely to materially serve\nas a screening agent for the foreseeable future, may be disqualified as counting towards the required buffer.\nD. Reserved.\nE. Application Toward Setback Requirements. Buffer yard areas shall be counted towards meeting applicable building setback areas.\nF.\nStandards for Walls and Fences. Fences used for buffering purposes shall be constructed in a durable fashion with weather resistant wood and be of a\nconsistent pattern. All materials used in the construction of a fence shall be designed and intended for such use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the\nAdministrator may approve a buffer fence constructed of other materials provided the materials and finish used will provide generally the same degree of\nopacity, durability, and aesthetic compatibility with adjoining residential areas as weather resistant wood. A finished side of all walls or fences shall face\nthe common property line boundary. No wall or fence used as part of a buffer shall be less than six feet or more than eight feet in height above grade\nunless approved by the Administrator in accordance with Section 11.1.2(F).\nG.\nStandards for Berms. All berms shall be planted with both shrubs and ground covers so as to leave no bare earth. All shrubs shall be a species that can be\nexpected to materially buffer the development site within five years of planting. The slope of a berm shall be of a grade so that it is suitable for\nmaintenance and soil stability while taking into consideration the type of plantings and ground cover that will be utilized but in no case shall a berm be\nless than three feet in height. The use of Pueraria lobata (kudzu) for berm ground cover is not permitted nor is any other nuisance vining plants that have\na tendency to spread to other properties.\nH. Location of Buffer Yard. With the exception of buffering required for open storage (refer to Section 11.6), any buffer yard required by this section shall be\nlocated along the side and/or rear property lines of the lot(s) containing the use subject to buffering. If buffering is required along the right-of-way, it shall\nbe located behind such right-of-way.\nI. Evergreen Shrubs. For all buffer yards, at least 50 percent of the required shrubs must be of an evergreen species.\nSec. 11.4 Street yard trees.\nabout:blank\n232/316\n"}, {"page": "233", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nA. Purpose. In order to absorb carbon dioxide and provide oxygen necessary for human life; purify air through transpiration; provide cooling through shade;\nreduce the impact of wind; retard the rate of water runoff; reduce glare and noise; to conserve property values; and to contribute to the natural beauty\nand aesthetics of the community, street trees, as herein provided, are required. Additional landscape planting strip standards associated with parking\ndecks are found in Sections 10.9.1.10.9.2 and 10.9.3. The required street trees may be planted within said landscaped area or elsewhere on the lot as\nherein called for in Subsection D. Greenstrips may also be required as provided for in Section 9.18.2.\nStreet trees and landscaping, as herein called for, shall only be required within the USO and CH Overlay districts only, except where specific reference is\nmade for street tree placement outside of these zoning districts.\nB. Required Locations.\n1. Street yard and landscaping requirements shall be met along and parallel to any public road for all new developments (except those listed in Section\n11.2.2), new developments along road frontage not developed, or substantial redevelopment of an existing site to another use (except for those listed\nin Section 11.2.2) within the Urban Standards (US) and (CH) Corridor Highway Overlay Districts. In addition, street yard and landscaping requirements\nshall be met on any internal road 250 linear feet or greater in length that is used as an entryway into a parking lot for a commercial development\nwithin said districts. Street trees shall also be required on lots located within a planned residential development (PRD), traditional neighborhood\ndevelopment (TND), and planned unit development (PUD), whether or not such developments are located in a (US) or (CH) Overlay District.\n2. Irrespective of the underlying zoning district, street trees and front yard landscaping shall not be required on any portion of a lot where the building\nline is within four feet of the adjoining street right-of-way.\nC. Number of Street Trees Required. Canopy and understory trees shall be planted, where required, as follows:\n1. One canopy tree for each 40 linear feet of frontage; or,\n2. One understory tree for each 30 feet of frontage; or,\n3. A combination of canopy and understory trees at the rate of one per 35 feet of frontage.\n4. For interior roads only, any combination of canopy trees so long as the type and spacing of trees placed can be expected to form a substantial canopy\nwithin 20 years of initial planting.\nD. Location of Trees.\n1. The Administrator shall have the authority to approve the placement of street trees in a variety of locations, based on: (i) the nature of the\ndevelopment; (ii) the underlying zoning district; (iii) the presence of other street trees on adjacent or nearby lots; (iv) the presence of overhead utility\nlines; (v) road maintenance; and (vi) other factors that directly affect the maintenance and long-term viability of the trees.\nAccordingly, the Administrator shall have the authority to have the street trees in the following locations, each of which is listed in descending order of\npreference:\na. Reserved.\nb. Within the landscape easement shown in Figure 11.4-1.\nC. Elsewhere in the front or side yard as practical.\nd. Within the sidewalk in planters or grates.\nWhere the Administrator deems none of the above locations feasible and practical, he shall have the authority to waive or modify the placement of\nstreet trees.\nWhere the Administrator deems that the placement of the greenstrip would be: (i) impossible to install in the prescribed location; or (ii) impossible or\nimpractical to be maintained; or (iii) would serve no useful public purpose, he shall have the authority to waive or modify the installation or width of\nthe greenstrip.\nRefer to Figure 11.4-1 below for a schematic of these possible locations. Such locations shall be as follows:\nabout:blank\n233/316\n"}, {"page": "234", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nFigure 11.4-1\n2. In no instance shall canopy trees be placed underneath aboveground utility lines.\n3. Distribution shall be generally proportionate along the road frontage; however, this shall not be construed to require equal intervals between trees.\nThe intent is to allow flexibility in design while discouraging long intervals without trees.\nE. Peninsula Lots. Properties with street frontage (not including Interstate 85 or the limited access portion of US 321) on three or more sides may reduce the\nnumber of required street trees by one-half for each street not listed as an \"arterial\" on the most recently adopted version of the local thoroughfare plan.\nF. Existing Trees. Existing trees with a caliper of at least ten inches Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) may be counted as two trees.\nG. Front Landscaped Areas. Street trees that are required to be planted per this Section may be placed in the required front landscaped area. Such\nlandscaped area shall be kept in a natural state with grass, plantings, mulch, or other such combination of planted materials. In no instance shall outdoor\nstorage of any kind be allowed in any required landscaped area.\nSec. 11.5 Parking lot yards.\nThe provision of off-street landscaping shall only be applicable to nonresidential developments and multi-family developments. Furthermore, all uses shown in\nSection 11.2.2 shall be exempt from these requirements. The provision of off-street landscaping shall only be applicable to nonresidential developments that are\nlocated on a site that contains (or proposed to contain) more than 25 parking spaces including staging spaces for any drive-up or drive-through windows. The\nfollowing guidelines also shall be used in determining whether parking lot landscaping provisions shall apply:\nA. Initial Developments. For any initial development (i.e., the construction of one or more new buildings on a lot) parking lot yard regulations shall apply\nif the lot contains more than 25 required off-street parking and/or staging spaces are needed as a result of the development.\nB.\nRedevelopments. For any building that is redeveloped (i.e., reconfigured or otherwise internally altered for a new use), the parking lot yard regulations\nshall apply only if the redevelopment increases the number of off-street parking spaces to more than 25. If this threshold is met, all parking spaces\nassociated with the use shall come into compliance with the parking lot landscaping regulations.\nC. Building Expansions. For any development that is expanded, the parking lot yard regulations shall apply if the expansion increases the number of off-\nstreet parking spaces to more than 25 and/or the expanded building coverage area removes more than 25 parking spaces. If either threshold is met,\nthe number of parking spaces associated with the expansion shall come into compliance with the parking lot landscaping regulations. On multi-tenant\ndevelopments where parking spaces between uses are generally shared, these regulations shall generally apply to those spaces in closest proximity to\nthe use being expanded.\nD. Quantities. Yards, as called for in this Section, for parking lots for any single use or any planned multi-tenant development with more than 25 parking\nspaces, including any staging spaces, (except for automobile sales lots which are treated in a separate manner as herein described), shall be provided\nin the following manner:\n1. Canopy trees-One per 15 spaces; and\n2. Understory trees-One per ten spaces; and\n3. Shrubs-One per four spaces.\nE. Reserved.\nF. Existing Trees. Existing canopy and/or understory trees located within 30 linear feet of a parking area or driveway surface, including a shopping center\nor similar planned multi-tenant development, may count towards meeting the parking lot yard requirements, as noted on the landscape plan. All\ndistances are to be measured from the nearest face of the tree trunk. Existing canopy trees with a caliper of ten inches or greater DBH, may count as\ntwo trees.\nG.\nabout:blank\n234/316\n"}, {"page": "235", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nDistribution. Required trees shall be located within or adjacent to parking lots as tree islands, medians, at the end of parking bays, traffic delineators or between\nrows or parking spaces in a manner such that no parking space is located greater than 75 linear feet from a canopy or understory tree on the subject property. Such\ntrees may be existing trees, or a tree installed pursuant to this Section. Refer to Figure 11.5-1 below for an example of how these requirements are applied.\nFigure 11.5-1\nH. Planting Area Dimensional Requirements. Planting areas and islands shall be not less than eight feet in width and shall include a minimum of 140 square\nfeet of open planting area for understory trees and 280 square feet for canopy trees. Shrubs or ground cover may be planted within the required open\nplanting area for trees without necessitating an increase in the required planted area. All landscaped areas called for in this section shall be protected\nfrom vehicular encroachment by concrete curb and gutter or similar material. Landscaped areas shall be covered with mulch, ground cover or grass in\nbetween shrub and tree plantings.\nI. Reserved.\nJ. Building Yard Areas. Parking areas located in the front or side yards shall be separated from the exterior wall of a structure by a landscaped area of at\nleast four feet in width. Shrubs shall be required within said area at a minimum of one per six linear feet. Refer to Figure 11.5-2 below for an illustration of\nthis requirement.\nFigure 11.5-2\nK.\nAutomobile Sales Lots. Properties intended for the sale of automobiles shall not be required to provide one canopy or understory tree within 75 linear\nfeet (per Subsection G) of the parking spaces used for the storage of cars displayed for sale. In lieu of the required landscaping for this use may be placed\non the outer perimeter of the lot, in addition to the requisite number of street trees, unless the width of the lot exceeds 400 feet. In such cases, the\nstorage areas shall be broken by a landscape strip running the depth of the storage area. Said landscape strip shall be at least 25 feet in width and shall\ncontain a minimum of 15 percent of the required landscaping of the storage area (if it were actually a required parking lot). Areas designed for employee\nand customer parking must still observe the 75-foot radius standard called for in Subsection G.\nSec. 11.6 - Open-air storage buffering.\nA. Within all zones, except for residential uses in Residential zones, buffering shall be required for the open storage of any goods, materials, products,\nwastes or equipment that is visible from any adjacent Residential zone and/or any public street. Excluded from such requirement are the following\ndisplays of items for sale: outdoor in-service vending machines; fresh produce; Christmas trees; live plants; bagged ice in freezers; firewood in sales bins,\nabout:blank\n235/316\n"}, {"page": "236", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\ntanks of propane in exchange racks; other retail goods left outside during business hours only; vehicle sales lots, trailers and other equipment capable of being\ntowed on a roadway sales lots, manufactured or modular home sales lots; and storage buildings prefabricated to building codes. Retail goods that are left outside\novernight and that can be readily carried without the assistance of a moving device [i.e., be less than 50 pounds in weight] shall also be excluded from the buffering\nrequirement.\nB. In addition to the above, all uses that store heavy equipment outdoors on a regular basis (e.g., bobcats, graders, and other such heavy equipment) shall\nprovide such buffering.\nC. Buffering for storage areas one acre or less in size shall consist of any one or more of the following: (i) a wall or opaque fence meeting the requirements\nof Section 11.3.5(F); or (ii) a Type C Buffer or greater.\nD. If the storage area is greater than one acre in size, screening shall consist of Type D Buffer or greater in addition to the fence or wall. Such planted strip\nshall be on the exterior of the wall or fence.\nSec. 11.7 Open space requirements.\nA. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all subdivisions of land. Specific provisions pertaining to traditional neighborhood developments, planned\nresidential developments, planned unit developments, infill residential developments and multi-family developments are found in Section 11.7.6.\nB. When a subdivision is located on a tract of land where a future greenway or greenway connection has been specifically identified on a locally adopted\nrecreation plan, or greenway master plan, open space for such designated greenway shall be dedicated and the fee-in-lieu option shall not be used for\nsuch lands.\nC. Any open space dedicated in association with a subdivision shall be owned and maintained by one or more of the following entities or organizations:\n1. A duly created Home Owners Association that, among other things, is responsible for maintaining common areas within the subdivision; or\n2. A Conservation Organization/private person for same conservation intent; or\n3. The State of North Carolina, Gaston County, or any municipality located within Gaston County; or\n4. Any other organization approved by the Planning Board.\nD.\nAny Open Space dedicated herein shall be irrevocably dedicated to public recreational and/or conservational use, regardless of the owner of the Open\nSpace, (unless a higher and better use is approved by the Board of Commissioners), and such restriction shall be set forth in the deed.\nE. The Home Owners Association shall be the owner of the Open Space unless the County Parks and Recreation Department or a separate Conservation\nOrganization accepts the Open Space.\nSec. 11.7.1 - Amount of land to be dedicated.\nAt least one thirty-fifth of an acre (equaling 1,244.57 square feet) shall be dedicated for each dwelling unit planned or proposed in the subdivision plat or\ndevelopment. The minimum amount of land which shall be dedicated for a public park, recreation, or open space site shall be no less than two acres in size. When\nthe calculated area for open space can not meet the two acre requirement, the subdivider shall be required to make payment in lieu of the dedication to be used for\nthe acquisition or development of recreation, park, or open space sites which would serve the needs of the residents of the subdivision.\nThe proximity of existing publicly dedicated and publicly accessible open space (e.g., park, greenway) to the subdivision shall reduce the amount of open space\nrequired in the subdivision. If such open space is located no greater than one-quarter mile walking distance (such distance measured from the pedestrian access\npoint of the existing open space to a perimeter public street or sidewalk within the development), the amount of required open space shall be reduced by up to\n25\npercent. If the existing public open space is located directly adjacent (either immediately abutting or directly across a public street) from the subdivision, the amount\nof required open space for the subdivision shall be reduced by up to 50 percent.\nExamples of how much open space is to be dedicated are as follows:\nA. Tract Area = 100 acres.\nNumber of Lots to be created = 75.\nOpen Space within 1/4 mile? = No.\nThe amount of open space to be dedicated shall be a minimum of 2.14 acres (i.e. 75/35). There is no nearby (i.e. within 1/4 mile) of publicly accessible\nopen space.\nB. Tract Area = 100 acres.\nNumber of Lots to be created = 75.\nOpen Space within 1/4 mile? = Yes, within 1/8 mile.\nThe amount of open space to be dedicated is initially computed as 2.14 acres (i.e. 75/35). Since publicly accessible open space is located less than 1/4\nmile from the tract, the amount of required open space is reduced by 25 to equal 1.60 acres. As this is LESS than the 2.0 acre minimum threshold, a\nfee in lieu, per section 11.7.3, will be paid.\nC. Tract Area = 10 acres.\nabout:blank\n236/316\n"}, {"page": "237", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nNumber of Lots to be created = 14.\nOpen Space within 1/4 mile? = No.\nThe amount of open space to be dedicated is initially computed as 0.40 acres (i.e. 14/35). This is below the 2.0 acre minimum threshold, thus a fee in\nlieu, per section 11.7.3, will be paid.\n(NOTE: Different amounts of open space are found in Section 11.7.6 of this Ordinance for planned residential developments, planned unit developments,\ntraditional neighborhood developments, and infill residential developments. In such instances the amount of required open space to be dedicated shall be\nas shown for that particular use.)\nSec. 11.7.2 - Nature of land to be dedicated.\nExcept as otherwise required by the Planning Board at the time of preliminary plat approval, all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria:\nA. Unity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the Planning Board determines that two or more parcels would be in the\nbest interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed development. In such cases, the\nPlanning Board, in approving the preliminary or final plat, may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least 30 feet in\nwidth. Where practical, the strip shall be placed in the subdivision to enable persons to walk between the two open space areas.\nB. Usability. Two-thirds of the dedicated land shall be useable for active recreation. Furthermore, public lakes and other public bodies of water may not\nbe included in computing any of the dedicated land area, except for wet detention ponds as provided for in Section 11.7.6(B)(3).\nC.\nShape. The shape of the portion of dedicated land which is deemed suitable for active recreation shall be sufficiently square or round to be usable for\nany or all recreational facilities and activities, such as athletic fields and tennis courts, when a sufficient amount of land is dedicated to accommodate\nsuch facilities. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this sub-section.\nD. Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of residents of the subdivision.\nE. Access. Access to the dedicated land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or by a dedicated public easement, at least 30 feet\nwide, which connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets shall allow for\nreasonable access to the dedicated land. Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the developer or subdivider shall remain\nresponsible for the installation of utilities, sidewalks, and other improvements required along that street segment. Public access or dedicated\nwalkways to greenway dedications only shall be at least 20 feet wide.\nF.\nTopography. The average slope of the portion of dedicated land deemed usable for active recreation shall not exceed the average slope of the entire\nsubdivision to be developed.

Dedicated parks, recreation, and open space areas shall have a sufficient natural or manmade buffer or screen to minimize any negative\nimpacts on adjacent residents.\nSec. 11.7.3 - Payments of fees in lieu of land dedication.\nA. General. The payment of fees, in lieu of the dedication of land as required above, may occur at the request of the subdivider or developer. However, the\ndecision to require the dedication of land for recreational purposes, or a payment of a fee in lieu, shall be made by the Planning Board after having\nreceived a recommendation from the TRC and having evaluated the proposed dedication and the relationship such dedication would have with the\nCounty's overall recreational needs. Payments of fees in lieu shall not be allowed for traditional neighborhood developments (TNDs), planned residential\ndevelopments (PRDs) and planned unit developments (PUDs).\nB. Time of Payment. The fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid to the County by the subdivider prior to final plat approval.\nC. Amount of Payment. The amount of the payment shall be the determined based on:\n1. The number of acres to be dedicated, as required above;\n2. The assessed value for property tax purposes of the land to be dedicated as listed in the Gaston County Tax Office at the time the calculation is made.\n3. Procedures for determining the amount is as follows:\nThe Administrator shall calculate the required payment amount using the following procedures:\na. The Administrator shall calculate the average per-acre value of land for the entire tract by dividing the assessed value of the entire unimproved\ntract of land by the total number of acres in the tract;\nb.\nThe Administrator shall then calculate the value of required open space at the date of most recent revaluation, which is the product of one thirty-\nfifth of the average per-acre value of land and the number of proposed residential lots in the subdivision.\nD. Application of Payments. The monies obtained in lieu of land dedication shall be used by the County to acquire recreational land or to improve\nexisting parks. While it is not required for the County to establish open space or build a park adjacent to the subdivision which provided the County\nmonies in lieu of land dedication, all efforts will be made for the County to apply such funds towards projects located near subdivisions which\nprovided payments as described herein. The County shall keep a detailed accounting on how the monies are used.\nSec. 11.7.4 Procedures.\nabout:blank\n237/316\n"}, {"page": "238", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nA. At the time of filing a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall designate thereon the area or areas to be dedicated. If the subdivider desires to make a\npayment in lieu of the dedication of land, a letter to that effect shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. The Planning Board reserves the right to\nrefuse to accept dedication of parcels for Public Park, recreation, or open space and to require a fee in lieu thereof.\nB. Where a dedication of land is required, such dedication shall be shown on the final plat when submitted. Where a payment in lieu of dedication is\napproved by the Planning Board, such payment will be made before the final plat is signed and recorded.\nSec. 11.7.5 Greenways.\nGreenways may be credited against the requirements of this section provided that such greenways are part of the County's greenway plan and dedicated to\npublic use.\nSec. 11.7.6 - Open space in Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TNDs), Planned Residential Developments (PRDs), Planned Unit Developments (PUDs), Infill\nResidential Developments and Multi-family Developments.\nA.

Planned Unit Development - Ten percent of gross acreage.\nNote: The payment of fees, in lieu of the dedication of land shall not be allowed for the development types listed above.\nB. Nature of Land to be Dedicated.\n1. Improved shall mean cleared of underbrush and debris and may contain one or more of the following improvements: walks and greenways, statues,\nutilities, irrigation fields, wet detention ponds, open fields, athletic fields, playground equipment, ponds and lakes (that are located entirely within the\ndevelopment). Certain open space areas (e.g., plazas) may also be paved.\n2. Open space shall be planned and improved so as to be accessible to users of the development.\n3. Wet detention ponds may be counted towards meeting the open space requirement if: (i) the facility is designed to hold water throughout the year,\nand (ii) if the facility is surrounded by a path or walkway and contains benches or similar improvements for enjoyment by residents or users of the\ndevelopment.\n4. Required landscaped and screening areas (per Chapter 11) shall not count towards this requirement.\nC. Shape and Size.\n1. The shape of the portion of dedicated land which is deemed suitable for active recreation shall be sufficiently square or round to be usable for any or\nall recreational facilities and activities, such as athletic fields and tennis courts, when a sufficient amount of land is dedicated to accommodate such\nfacilities.\n2. Two-thirds of the dedicated land shall be useable for active recreation. Furthermore, lakes and other bodies of water may not be included in\ncomputing any of the dedicated land area.\n3. A reduction in the required open space may be allowed up to 50 percent if the common open space is within one-half mile of a public open space.\n4.

To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;\nB. To provide a pleasing overall environmental setting and good community appearance;\nC. To create and promote a productive, enterprising, professional business atmosphere;\nD. To allow signs appropriate to the planned character and development of each zoning district;\nE. To ensure that permitted signs do not become a hazard or nuisance;\nF. To promote traffic safety and safe way-finding for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians;\nG. To prevent permanent and temporary signs from conflicting with public safety signs;\nH. To protect and enhance the value of properties;\nI. To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected; and\nJ. To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication.\nSec. 12.1.2 Applicability.\nA. It shall be unlawful to construct, enlarge, modify, move or replace any sign or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a zoning permit for such\nsign from the Administrator as required by this ordinance. A fee shall be charged for each sign permit issued.\nB.\nChanging or replacing the permanent copy on an existing lawful sign shall not require a permit, provided the copy change does not change the physical\ndimensions of the sign so as to render it in violation of this ordinance.\nC. If any section, specific provision, or standard of these regulations, that now exists or may exist in the future, is found by a court of competent jurisdiction\nto be invalid for any reason, the decision of the courts shall not affect the validity of any other section, provision, or standard of these regulations except\nthe provision in question. The other portions of these regulations not affected by the decision shall remain in full force and effect.\nSec. 12.1.3 Sign area and height measurements.\nA. Sign Area Computations.\nThe Administrator shall employ the following principles when determining the area of sign:\n1. The area of a sign face shall be computed by using up to three of the smallest basic geometric shapes (i.e. square, circle, triangle) that will encompass\nthe extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the\nbackground of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. Such measurement shall not\ninclude any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall is clearly incidental to the display itself and does not\ncontain any sign copy. For pole signs, poles covered with corporate logos or with more than one corporate color will be considered part of the sign\narea.\n2. For a single wall (i.e., the entire wall that shares the same architectural elevation as shown on the approved sign permit) all pieces of information or\nother graphic representations on the wall that are logically related shall be measured as part of one sign. If multiple signs on a single wall share a\nframe or other material of color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the signs from the background against which they are\nplaced, such area will be measured as part of one sign.\n3.\nRegardless of whether a single wall has wall sections that project, recess or otherwise vary from the predominate wall plane, the sign area\nmeasurement shall include the area of all sign faces that can be viewed from a single vantage point. Signs may be placed back-to-back, side-by-side, or\nin V-type construction.\na. Side-by-side signs must be structurally tied together and considered as one sign.\nb. V-type and back-to-back signs must be considered as two signs if the angle between the faces is 45 degrees or more.\nC. In all other cases, the areas of each face of a multi-facedsign shall be added togethertocomputethe sign area. Sign area of multi-faced signs\nis\ncalculated based on the principle that all sign elements that can be seen at one time or from one vantage point should be considered when\nmeasuring the area of such sign.\nExamples of how sign area is to be computed are indicated below:\nabout:blank\n239/316\n"}, {"page": "240", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nB.

The Watershed Review Board may grant a variance, if it has evaluated the application for a variance and determined that:\na. There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the application of the strict letter of the Chapter. In order to determine that there are\npractical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Board shall find that the five following conditions exist:\ni.\nIf the applicant complies with the provisions of the Chapter, he/she can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of his/her\nproperty. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property shall not be considered adequate to\njustify the Board in granting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider a variance that is the minimum possible deviation from the terms\nof the Chapter which will make possible the reasonable use of his/her property.\nii. The hardship results from the application of the Chapter to the property, rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other\nhardship.\niii. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size, shape or topography, which is different from that of\nneighboring property.\niv. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the Chapter, or who purchases the\nproperty after the effective date of the Chapter, and then comes to the Board for relief.\nV. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally\nsubject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and would not\npromote equal justice.\nb.\nThe variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Chapter and preserves its spirit.\nC. In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done. The Board shall not grant a\nvariance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health, safety or general welfare. These findings of the Board shall be\nrecorded in the permanent record of the case.\n3. In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed building,\nstructure, or use. If a variance for the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such construction, alteration or use shall be in accordance\nwith the approved site plan.\n4. The Watershed Review Board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied, if it finds there have been no\nsubstantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application.\n5. A variance issued in accordance with this Section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed\noccupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision.\n6. Should the application request the granting of a major variance, and if the Watershed Review Board decides in favor of granting the variance, the\nBoard shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:\na. The variance application;\nb. The hearing notices;\nC. The evidence presented;\nd. Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them;\ne. Proposed findings and exceptions;\nf. The proposed decision, including all conditions added to the permit.\n7. The preliminary record shall be sent to the Environmental Management Commission for its review as follows:\na.

It is the intent of this plan to address this\nrequirement and serve as a guide for County staff and other agencies.\nSec. 15.10.2 Jurisdiction.\nThis plan shall be in effect for water supply water shed areas designated on the Watershed Protection Map of Gaston County and shall include municipal\njurisdictions (corporate limits and extraterritorial planning jurisdictions) of Bessemer City, Cherryville, Dallas, Kings Mountain, High Shoals, Ranlo and Stanley which\nlie with a water supply watershed.\nSec. 15.10.3 Section 1.\nThe Watershed Management Plan for Gaston County, for territory as defined in the Water Supply Watershed Regulations for Gaston County North Carolina, shall\nadopt the Gaston County Multi-Hazard Plan, adopted December 1989 (as amended), as the guidelines and regulations for hazardous material inventory and\nidentification; spill containment of hazardous chemicals and substances; and public notification. Nothing contained herein shall repeal, modify, or amend the Gaston\nCounty Multi- Hazard Plan as adopted.\nSec. 15.10.4 Section 2.\nThe specific list of facilities involved with Hazardous Materials storage and handling, subject to the emergency planning requirements of Section 15.4.2 of the\nSuperfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA, Title III) are on file and maintained in the Gaston County Emergency Management Office.\nSec. 15.10.5 Section 3.\nA. There are two basic situations involving hazardous materials: i) accidents at fixed facilities; and ii) transportation accidents. In case of an emergency or a\nspill of hazardous materials, the first responder units (volunteer fire departments, municipal fire department, municipal or County police, or other\nemergency personnel) will respond to the accident to recognize and identify, to the extent possible, the type of hazardous material involved and the\nextent of the accident. The Office of Emergency Management will be notified and personnel dispatched to coordinate activities at the site; evaluate the\ndegree of hazard; determine the level of response needed; coordinate containment efforts; make necessary notifications appropriate agencies,\nsurrounding property owners, and media.\nB.\nabout:blank\n290/316\n"}, {"page": "291", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThe level of response will be determined by the amount and toxicity of the material involved in the accident or the release; the population or water source\nthreatened; the level of protective equipment required for the involved substance(s); and the imminent danger should no immediate action be taken. Depending\nupon the seriousness of the threat to the public, actions could include in-place sheltering, evacuation, and notification of contaminated water supplies. One of three\nlevels of response will occur:\n1. Level / (Potential Emergency Condition): An incident which can be controlled by the first response agencies; does not require evacuation of other than\nthe involved structure or immediate outdoor area; and does not indicate major damage will occur.\n2. Level // (Limited Emergency Condition): An incident involving a greater hazard or larger contaminated area posing a potential threat to life or property,\nand may require a limited evacuation of the surrounding area or indicates that a major environmental damage could occur. Initial response to the\nincident can be adequately handled by the jurisdiction's personnel and resources.\n3. Level III (Full Emergency Condition): An incident involving a severe hazard or larger area posing a extreme threat to life or property and which may\nrequire a large scale evacuation of the surrounding area, or an incident requiring the combined expertise or resources of the Count State, and/or\nfederal governments and /or private agencies or organizations.\nSec. 15.10.6 Section 4.\nA.\nAfter determination of the nature of the accident and the degree of risk, the Gastonia Hazardous Management Team would be dispatched to the scene, if\nnecessary, under a mutual aid agreement between the County and the City of Gastonia for County wide response of the Management Team.

These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the\noccupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nSec. 16.1.3 - Statement of purpose.\nIt is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within\nflood prone areas by provisions designed to:\nA. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in\nerosion, flood heights or velocities;\nB. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of\nfloodwaters;\nD. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and\nE. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nSec. 16.1.4 Objectives.\nabout:blank\n291/316\n"}, {"page": "292", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThe objectives of this chapter are to:\nA.

The Administrator shall serve written notice of such revocation upon the alleged violator or property owner.\nSec. 18.6 Penalties for violation.\nIf following the issue of a \"notice of violation\" as called for in Section 18.5, the Administrator determines that the alleged violation has not been cured or\ncorrected during the stated \"warning period\", he shall have the authority to issue a penalty as outlined herein.\nSec. 18.6.1 First offense.\nAny violation occurring once within a 12-month period shall be considered a first offense. A notice of violation shall be issued by the Administrator and shall\nprovide for a warning period as provided for in Section 18.5(C) to correct the violation. Upon the expiration of the warning period, the violator shall be subject to a\ncivil penalty of $100.00 for each day that the violation remains on the property. Should a violation continue to exist by the 21st day past the date of original\nnotification, the County may seek to recover the penalty together with all costs by filing a civil action in the General Court of Justice in the nature of a suit to collect a\ndebt. The collection of a penalty pursuant hereto shall not foreclose further proceedings for penalties coming due subsequent to the date of the filing of a prior\nproceeding. The provisions of this section may also be enforced through any other appropriate remedies as prescribed in Section 18.4 herein.\nSec. 18.6.2 Repeat offense.\nAny violation of reoccurring on the same property by the same violator more than once within a 12-month period shall be considered a repeat offense provided\nthe reoccurrence is a violation of the same Section of this Ordinance. A notice of violation shall be issued by the Administrator and shall have an immediate civil\npenalty of $300.00. No warning period shall be granted since this provision applies only to violations that occur more than once in a 12-month period and proper\nnotice was given for the initial violation as prescribed under Section 18.5. For each day the repeat violation remains, the violator shall be subject to a civil penalty of\n$300.00. Should a violation continue to exist by the 7th day after such notification, the County may seek to recover the penalty together with all costs by filing a civil\naction in the General Court of Justice in the nature of a suit to collect a debt. The collection of a penalty pursuant hereto shall not foreclose further proceedings for\npenalties coming due subsequent to the date of the filing of a prior proceeding. The provisions of this section may also be enforced through any other appropriate\nremedies as prescribed in Section 18.4 herein.\nSec. 18.7 Other powers.\nIn addition to the enforcement powers specified in this Section, the Board of Commissioners may exercise any and all enforcement powers granted by North\nCarolina law.\nSec. 18.8 - Remedies cumulative.\nThe remedies and enforcement powers established in this Chapter shall be cumulative, and the County may exercise them in any order.\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE\nabout:blank\n308/316\n"}, {"page": "309", "text": "6/26/23, 8:45 AM\nGaston County, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThis is a chronological listing of the ordinances and resolutions of the county used in this Unified Development Code.
