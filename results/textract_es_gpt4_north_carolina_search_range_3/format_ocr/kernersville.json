Such a mutual agreement pursuant to G.S.160D-203 shall only be\napplicable to development regulations and shall not affect taxation or other non-regulatory matters.

A ditch or canal may have flows that are perennial, intermittent,\nor ephemeral and may exhibit hydrological and biological characteristics similar to perennial or intermittent streams.\n'Ephemeral stream' means a feature that carries only stormwater in direct response to precipitation with water\nflowing only during and shortly after large precipitation events. An ephemeral stream may or may not have a well-\ndefined channel, the aquatic bed is always above the water table, and stormwater runoff is the primary source of water.\nAn ephemeral stream typically lacks the biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics commonly associated\nwith the continuous or intermittent conveyance of water.\n'Existing development' means development, other than that associated with agricultural or forest management\nactivities that meets one of the following criteria:\n1.\nIt either is built or has established a vested right based on statutory or common law as interpreted by the\ncourts, for projects that do not require a state permit, as of the effective date of either local new development\nstormwater programs implemented under Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0265 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient\nStrategy: Stormwater Management for New Development) or, for projects requiring a state permit, as of the\napplicable compliance date established in Rule 15A NCAC 2B .0271 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient\nStrategy: Stormwater Management for New Development), Items (5) and (6); or\n2.\nIt occurs after the compliance date set out in Sub-Item (4) (d) of Rule .0265 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient\nStrategy: Stormwater Management for New Development) but does not result in a net increase in built-upon\narea.\n'Greenway / Hiking Trails' means pedestrian trails constructed of pervious or impervious surfaces and related\nstructures including but not limited to boardwalks, steps, rails, and signage, and that generally run parallel to the\nshoreline.\n'High Value Tree' means a tree that meets or exceeds the following standards: for pine species, 14-inch DBH or\ngreater or 18-inch or greater stump diameter; or for hardwoods and wetland species, 16-inch DBH or greater or 24-\ninch or greater stump diameter.\n'Intermittent stream' means a well-defined channel that contains water for only part of the year, typically during\nwinter and spring when the aquatic bed is below the water table.

Stabilization techniques which include\n\"soft\" methods or natural materials (such as root wads, or rock vanes) may be considered as part of a restoration\ndesign. However, stabilization techniques that consist primarily of \"hard\" engineering, such as concrete lined\nchannels, riprap, or gabions, while providing bank stabilization, shall not be considered stream restoration.\n'Stream restoration' is defined as the process of converting an unstable, altered or degraded stream corridor,\nincluding adjacent riparian zone and flood-prone areas to its natural or referenced, stable conditions considering recent\nand future watershed conditions. This process also includes restoring the geomorphic dimension, pattern, and profile\nas well as biological and chemical integrity, including transport of water and sediment produced by the stream's\nwatershed in order to achieve dynamic equilibrium. 'Referenced' or 'referenced reach' means a stable stream that is\nin dynamic equilibrium with its valley and contributing watershed. A reference reach can be used to develop natural\nchannel design criteria for stream restoration projects.\n'Stream' means a body of concentrated flowing water in a natural low area or natural channel on the land surface.\n'Stump diameter' means the diameter of a tree measured at six inches above the ground surface level.\n'Surface waters' means all waters of the state as defined in G.S. 143-212 except underground waters\n'Tree' means a woody plant with a DBH equal to or exceeding five inches or a stump diameter exceeding six inches.\n'Temporary road' means a road constructed temporarily for equipment access to build or replace hydraulic\nconveyance structures such as bridges, culverts, pipes or water dependent structures, or to maintain public traffic\nduring construction.\n451\nUnified Development Ordinance\nChapter C Article V\n"}, {"page": "450", "text": "CHAPTER C - ENVIRONMENTAL ORDINANCE\nARTICLE VI - RIPARIAN BUFFER PROTECTION ORDINANCE\nFOR LANDS WITHIN THE RANDLEMAN LAKE WATERSHED\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n453\nUnified Development Ordinance\nChapter C - Article VI\nCELL (1, 1): \n6-1.2\nCELL (1, 2): \nPURPOSE AND INTENT\n454\nCELL (2, 1): \n6-1.3\nCELL (2, 2): \nTITLE\n454\nCELL (3, 1): \n6-1.4\nCELL (3, 2): \nJURISDICTION\n454\nCELL (4, 1): \n6-1.6\nCELL (4, 2): \nRELATION TO OTHER ORDINANCES\n454\nCELL (5, 1): \n6-1.7\nCELL (5, 2): \nRIPARIAN AREA PROTECTION WITHIN THE RANDLEMAN LAKE RESERVOIR\nWATERSHED\n455\nCELL (6, 1): \nA.\nCELL (6, 2): \nBuffers Protected\n455\nCELL (7, 1): \nB.\nCELL (7, 2): \nExemption Based on On-site Determination\n455\nCELL (8, 1): \nC.\nCELL (8, 2): \nExemption when Existing Uses are Present and Ongoing\n456\nCELL (9, 1): \nD.\nCELL (9, 2): \nZones of the Riparian Buffer\n457\nCELL (10, 1): \nE.\nCELL (10, 2): \nDiffuse Flow Requirements\n457\nCELL (11, 1): \n6-1.8\nCELL (11, 2): \nPOTENTIAL USES AND ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS\n457\nCELL (12, 1): \nA.\nCELL (12, 2): \nApproval for New Development\n457\nCELL (13, 1): \nB.\nCELL (13, 2): \nTable of Uses\n458\nCELL (14, 1): \nC.\nCELL (14, 2): \nRequirements for Categories of Uses\n464\nCELL (15, 1): \n6-1.9\nCELL (15, 2): \nPERMITS PROCEDURES, REQUIREMENTS, AND APPROVALS\n465\nCELL (16, 1): \nA.\nCELL (16, 2): \nDetermination of No Practical Alternatives / Request for Authorization Certificate\n465\nCELL (17, 1): \nB.\nCELL (17, 2): \nVariances\n466\nCELL (18, 1): \nC.\nCELL (18, 2): \nMitigation\nError!
