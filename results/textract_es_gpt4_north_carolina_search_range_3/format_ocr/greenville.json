The\nfocus of a traditional master plan community is on providing residents with robust recreation and open space. An agricultural master plan community is focused on developments that emphasize\nproduction of agricultural products that cater to the needs of the local community.\n(D) Any PUD zoning district development that has received special use permit approval of a land use plan per the former Article J of this chapter prior to December 10, 2009, and such special use\npermit remains in effect, may continue under the approved special use permit and standards in effect at the time of the special use permit approval.

Specifically, there shall be no change of grade (cut or fill), compaction of soils, storage of construction material,\ndebris, chemicals and/or machinery or other activities which otherwise inhibits the percolation of surface water within the \"Area of Minimum Protection\" as described under subsection (G)(2) below.\n(2) Area of minimum protection (by plant material type).\n(a) Large tree: Eight-foot radius or drip zone, whichever is less.\n(b) Small tree: Six-foot radius or drip zone, whichever is less.\n(c) Evergreen shrub: Four-foot radius or drip zone, whichever is less.\n(3) Barrier required. Existing substitute material shall be screened by means of a visible barrier which identifies the limits of the area of minimum protection.\n(4) Qualifying the location and material type; site identification.\n(a) Prior to site plan approval the existing substitute material shall be identified upon the preliminary vegetation plan in sufficient detail to ensure compliance with this section.\n(b) All large and small trees subject to this section shall be individually flagged or paint-marked at the time of submission of the preliminary and final vegetation plan, except as further provided.\n(c) Where there are 20 or more qualified large and/or small trees located within a continuous stand the boundary of the tree line may be indicated on the preliminary and final vegetation plan in\nlieu of individual marking. For purposes of this section, the term \"continuous stand\" shall be construed as a unified and closely spaced group of trees which is void of impervious encroachments.\nScattered individual or groups of trees which do not, or will not upon maturity, share common canopy space and/or a narrow linear row(s) of trees shall not be construed as a continuous stand.\n(Ord.

Substitutions shall only be considered and allowed on an individual tree-\nby-tree basis. The intent of this section shall be to require the installation of large trees to the greatest extent possible.\n(b) Where the small tree substitution is allowed each small tree shall have not less than six square feet of exclusive open space which measures not less than two feet at its narrowest\ndimension. Where the available open space does not meet this requirement, as determined by the Director of Planning and Development Services, shrubs may be substituted for small trees on a one-\nfor-one basis; provided, however, where the open space is less than four square feet in area and/or less than two feet in width ground cover may be substituted for shrubs.\n(3) Except as otherwise provided under this section the vegetation material (category) substitution standards contained under section9-4-265 may apply at the option of the owner.\n(4) Such street yard vegetation shall be located within 15 feet of the street right-of-way or easement line unless otherwise provided; however, no large tree shall be installed closer than two feet\nto\nthe back of curb, travel surface or sidewalk located on the right-of-way or easement.\n(Ord.

For purposes of this section, any parking area drive or drive isle, which separates a parking space from the street right-of-way or easement line, shall be considered part of the parking area and\nthe drive or drive isle shall be screened in accordance with this section. Parking areas which deflect from the street line shall be considered a part of the parking area subject to the screening\nrequirement of this section where the parking area is less than 50 feet from the street right-of-way or easement line and in accordance with subsection (L)(9)(b) below.\n(b) The intent of parking area vegetation screening shall be to provide a year-round visual screen between parking areas and public or private streets.
