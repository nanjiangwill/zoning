The district encourages\nhigh-quality development and open space protection and is found\nfurther away from nonresidential areas. These low-density suburban\nneighborhoods may or may not include public water and sewer\nservices, although development on public services at this density is not\ngenerally considered an efficient use of these services.\nB.

Where possible, developers shall use innovative\nsite planning techniques to keep units away from the lakefront,\nstreams, and other sensitive areas. Such techniques include but are not\nlimited to cluster development patterns, mixtures of zoning categories,\nstrategic location of densities so that larger and less densely developed\nlots are closer to the lakefront and creative use of greenways and open\nspace.\nF.\nPerformance Standards\n1. Within the LBC, the impervious surface may not exceed six percent\nof land area per lot, except where runoff as described above is\nretained by retention ponds or other approved devices constructed\npursuant to best management practices in which case it may not\nexceed a maximum of 35 percent.\n2.

Impervious Surface Limits\n1. Within the LBC, in order to reduce stormwater pollution through\nnatural infiltration on undisturbed vegetated land, the impervious\nsurface area may not exceed six percent regardless of lot size or\ndensity, except where the stormwater runoff from a one-inch\nrainfall event is retained by retention ponds or other approved\ndevices.\n2. Impervious surface area within the LBC may be a maximum of 35\npercent under the high-density development option where the\nstormwater runoff from a one-inch rainfall event is retained by\nretention ponds or other approved devices.\n3.

Enhance trade, tourism, capital investment, and the general welfare\nalong the thoroughfare.\n4. Preserve undisturbed natural or native vegetation between the\ninterstate(s) and current and future adjacent uses.\nB. Location\nThe LHO applies to either side of I-40 within the Garner zoning\njurisdiction, as well as to all future interstate development including the\nfuture I-540, and is measured from the outside right-of-way line of the\nroadway at its farthest point (including access ramps and interchanges\nand rights-of-way for those same areas) a distance of 1,250 feet, as\nshown on the Official Zoning Map.\nIn cases where any portion of a building or parking area falls within the\nboundaries of the overlay district, these provisions shall apply to any\nand all other buildings and parking areas.\nC.

Use categories classify land uses and activities into use categories\nbased on common functional, product or physical characteristics.\nCharacteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of\ncustomers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered\nand site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for\nassigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts.\nB. Residential uses encompass all uses within the residential use category.\nAll other uses are nonresidential.\nC. In a mixed-use development, where nonresidential and residential uses\nboth exist, the uses shall be counted separately where it is pertinent.\nFor example, when evaluating parking reductions for nonresidential\nuses, only the floorspace housing nonresidential uses shall be counted.\nUDO 6-8\n"}, {"page": "138", "text": "Article 6: Use Regulations\nSection 6.3: Principal Uses\n6.3.\nPRINCIPAL USES\nPrincipal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature\nof the principal use. The characteristics, definitions, examples, and exceptions\nsubsections below describes the common identifying features of each principal use\nand may be used to classify uses.\n6.3.1.\nDevelopments with Multiple Principal Uses\nWhen all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire\ndevelopment is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a\ncoffee shop, bookstore and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail\nsales and service category because all of the development's principal uses are in\nthat category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use\ncategories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use\nis subject to all applicable regulations for that category. If a principal use is not\nlisted for a given district, it may not be developed in that district, whether as part\nof a proposed mixed-use project or a stand-alone project.\n6.3.2.\nAccessory Uses\nAccessory uses are allowed by-right in conjunction with a principal use unless\notherwise stated in this UDO. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are\nsubject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are\nlisted as examples in the use category descriptions.\n6.3.3.\nUse of Examples\nThe \"examples\" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses\nincluded in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are\ngeneric. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may\ncall itself. For example, a use that calls itself \"wholesale warehouse\" but that sells\nmostly to consumers, is included in the retail sales and service category rather\nthan the wholesale sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site\nmatches the description of the retail sales and service category.\n6.3.4.\nSimilar Use Interpretation Criteria\nThe following considerations shall be used in making similar use interpretations:\nA. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to\nthe stated characteristics of each use category.\nB. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted\nto the activity.\nC. Relative amounts of sales from each activity.\nD. The customer type for each activity.\nE.

Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and\nproperty due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging\nincreases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;\n2.
