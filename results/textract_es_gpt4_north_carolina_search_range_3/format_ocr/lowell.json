Farmland is a defining\nelement of Lowell's traditional identity and the protection of these lands aids in\npreserving the character of the City until such time as new development is preferred by\nthe City. Listed uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature.\nDevelopment density is very low to encourage preservation of agricultural lands while\ndiscouraging large lot residential subdivision type development and excessive septic\nsystem utility. The Agriculture District can also be used to preserve open spaces.\nThe Single-Family Residential Districts (SFR-2, SFR-3 and SFR-4) provide for the\ncompletion of existing residential neighborhoods and the development of new residential\nneighborhoods. Allowed building/lot types in the Single-Family Districts are Detached\nHouse. Listed uses are restricted to Single-Family, including duplex (two-family), homes\nand their accessory uses. Neighborhoods in these districts are the dominant land use in\nLowell and are a major element in defining the character of the community. Standards\nfor the Single-Family Residential Districts promote that new development maintains the\ncharacter of the community. The Single-Family Residential Districts permit the\ncompletion and conformity of conventional residential subdivisions already existing or\napproved in sketch plan form by the City of Lowell prior to the effective date of these\nregulations.\nThe Residential Main Street Transition District (RMST) provides for the completion of\nresidential neighborhoods in the residential area(s) surrounding the Main Street and\ncontiguous Civic Districts through in-fill development. The intent of this district is to\nrecognize that gradual transformation of existing development to high quality mixed\ndensity residential development is needed to support the central core of the City. Higher\ndensity residential development allows a greater number of households to walk or bike,\nthus supporting businesses while reducing the parking demand and providing\nenvironmental and health benefits. Allowed building/lot types in these districts are the\nDetached House, Attached House, and Multi-family Building. Streets in the Residential\nMain Street Transition District should be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks\nproviding a connection from Lowell's Main Street and other mixed-use districts to the\nSingle-Family Residential districts surrounding these neighborhoods. A range of housing\ntypes is encouraged. Criteria for the mix of building types establishes compatibility.\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 2\n"}, {"page": "3", "text": "The Main Street District (MS) provides for new development, revitalization, reuse, and\ninfill development in Lowell's core downtown. A broad array of uses is listed to enable\nthe needs of residents and visitors to be met. Allowed building/lot types in this district are\nUrban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, Attached House, Multi-family Building,\nand Civic Building. The development pattern seeks to integrate shops, restaurants,\nservices, workplaces, civic, educational, and higher density housing in a compact,\npedestrian-oriented environment. The Main Street District serves as the hub of the\nsurrounding neighborhoods and of the broader community. The Main Street District may\nbe expanded over time to meet the needs of the growing community for downtown\nfacilities and services. Expansion of the Main Street District shall be contiguous and not\nseparated from the primary district area.\nThe Civic District (CIV) provides a location for educational, medical, governmental,\nreligious, and other institutional uses. Large developments in the Civic District are\nencouraged to provide a master plan to the City. Institutional uses in the Civic District\nare required to provide pedestrian connections on their campuses and, to the extent\npossible, develop an internal street system with structures fronting on the streets. Parking\nshould not be the dominant visible element of the campuses developed for institutional\nuses. Providing a unique district for civic uses will establish uniform standards.\nThe Mixed-Use Districts (MU-1 and MU-2) are established to provide opportunities for\nboth compatible and sustainable re-development where underutilized commercial\nproperties already exist as well as infill sites where site specific land planning of new\ndevelopment creates opportunities for businesses and various housing designs sharing\ncommunity amenities and enhancements. Existing auto-oriented street, lot, and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site\nplanning these areas will allow a greater number of residents to walk or bike to\nbusinesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and sidewalks.\nAllowed building/lot types are Highway Commercial, Urban Workplace, Shop-front,\nDetached House, Attached House, and Multi-family. Dominant uses in this district are\nresidential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use Districts are expected to serve Lowell\nresidents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development\npattern in this district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access\nprovided to promote safety for the motoring public. Development standards in the\nMixed-Use Districts promote the creation of a pleasant pedestrian-friendly auto-oriented\nenvironment while enabling a compatible transition to uses in adjacent neighborhood\ndistricts.\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 3\n"}, {"page": "4", "text": "The Interstate Highway 85 Commercial District (C-85) is established to provide\nopportunities for compatible, resilient and sustainable development along the Interstate\nHighway 85 corridor.

Development standards in the Vehicle Service and Repair\nDistrict acknowledge that the automobile is the primary mode of transportation in\nsuburban communities and there is a vital need for such businesses to be located in close\nproximity to one another. Uses within the Vehicle Service and Repair District are\nbuffered from adjacent uses. The dominant uses in this district are vehicle oriented\nand/or dependent and include vehicle-based services, vehicle repair shops and disabled\nvehicle storage areas. The Vehicle Service and Repair District is reserved for uses which\nrequire broad maneuvering spaces and avoid pedestrian interaction with potentially\nhazardous conditions. Goals of the Vehicle Service and Repair District include providing\na pleasant environment for motorists, a safe environment for pedestrians along the\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian facilities; promoting the safety of motorists and\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 4\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "pedestrians; and preserving the capacity of Main Street and it's interconnecting network\nof streets outside the core area as shown in the adopted City Plan.

Uses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale\nmanufacturing and storage that is compatible with less intensive uses can and should be\nlocated in other non-residential or mixed-use districts. The Industrial District is reserved\nfor uses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities.\nThe Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TNDO) provides for the\ndevelopment of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing\nneighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of\ninterconnecting pedestrian-oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional\nNeighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices,\nprominently sited civic or community building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and\nchurches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood\nDevelopment (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is\na quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of\nthe existing developed area of the City and has an overall residential density of up to\neleven (11) dwelling units per acre. TNDO districts should have a significant portion of\nland dedicated to improved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces where\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are located.\nThe Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes\nand open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Lowell's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through a\nmix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the\nsuburban character of the City by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an\nurban environment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 5\n"}, {"page": "6", "text": "The Heavy Industry Overlay District (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development.

However, it\nis required that industries in this district take all necessary actions including but not\nlimited to installation of apparatus and technological equipment available to prevent\nnegative impacts on the environment and the community from the emissions of smoke,\ndust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities and/or products resulting from such\nhazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.\nThe Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel,\nor property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and\nagricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit\nper developed acre, projects developed in accordance with these standards can obtain\ndensity bonuses while preserving unique natural features for agricultural use. The Mini\nFarm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land and open space\nwith density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the\nintent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the\nCity and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached House.\nThe Manufactured Home Overlay District (MHO) is established to protect the standard of\nliving and neighborhood conditions. Established standards that will enable the use of\ninnovative manufactured homes with a higher aesthetic standard will invigorate these\ncommunities. Non-conforming manufactured home parks that have not received\napproval for continuation would be amortized over a period of time to allow the\nowner/operator to meet reasonable financial payback expectations in accordance with\naccepted practices in North Carolina. Existing parks could be limited to less fundamental\nstandards and specifications, while new parks are required to meet a higher standard.\nThese parks may be ideally suited for alternative designs such as Tiny House, Park\nModel and other styles of housing where installation standards are considered temporary.\nThe overlay could be expanded to apply to permanent installations of innovative\nmanufactured housing in subdivisions or parks in accordance with G.S. 160D-909.\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 6\n"}, {"page": "7", "text": "8.4\nDistrict Development Standards and Permitted Uses Listed for Each District\nDevelopment standards are established for each of the following Primary General-Use\nDistricts to promote the orderly development of the City of Lowell.

The Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the\npastoral scenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and\nvisitors traveling the major entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral\nscenes and undeveloped property along the entrance roads and gateways contribute\nsignificantly to Lowell's community character and sense of place. The Scenic\nCorridor Overlay District provides development options for the owners of the\nproperty abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of this district is to\nprotect the scenic value of the corridors through a mix of incentives and\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the suburban character of\nthe City by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an urban environment;\nprovide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the corridor;\nprovide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\n(B.) Types. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n(1.) Suburban Scenic Corridor - A corridor along which development is limited,\nconsisting largely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The\nsuburban scenic corridor evokes a sense of traveling through an undeveloped\narea, with pastoral scenes and a sense of being removed from the urban\nenvironment.\n(2.) Gateway Scenic Corridor - A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a\nplace that is unique and different from other communities in the area. The\ngateway corridor provides a sense of arrival to a place that is special and\ndifferent from the typical places. The gateway scenic corridor may be more\ndeveloped than the suburban scenic corridor, but the character of the\ndevelopment is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in\na\nspecial place.\n(3.) Bypass Scenic Corridor - A corridor providing for buffering of the Bypass to\nprotect the traffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant\nexperience for motorists using the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor\nrequires an undeveloped setback from the bypass, promoting that the bypass\nthrough Lowell is unique and portrays the character of the community while\nenhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 32\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "(C.) General Standards & Specifications:\n(1.) Development Pattern. Building placement, parking placement, building type,\nurban form, access, and lot arrangement shall be controlled by the lot and\nbuilding type standards (Article 9) for the lot and building types listed in the\nScenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(2.) Activities Listed in the Scenic Corridor. In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic\ncorridors shall be limited to the following:\n(a.) The scenic corridor easement may be used for passive recreation,\nagricultural uses, and equestrian uses. No other use shall be listed within\nthe scenic corridor easement.\n(b.) No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree\nremoval, lighting (other than street lighting provided by the City of Lowell\nand driveway or private road lighting provided that said lighting is\nprovided by full cutoff fixtures), or other development activity shall occur\nwithin the scenic corridor easement except as follows:\n(i.) A bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be\nlocated within the scenic corridor easement.\n(ii.) Underground utilities and easements for underground utilities may be\nlocated within the scenic easement, provided that no above ground\ntransmission or other equipment is located within the scenic easement.\n(iii.) Buildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related\nactivities may be built in the scenic corridor easement upon approval\nby the City Council as a Special Use. Parking shall be located behind\nthe building, shall not be located within the scenic easement, and shall\nbe buffered from the scenic corridor. The City Council shall consider\nthe following items in making the decision to allow aforesaid buildings\nin the scenic easement:\n1. The building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\n2. The building's size;\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with community\ncharacter and the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n(3.) Scenic Corridor Dimensions. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the\nfollowing dimensional standards:\n(a.) The width of the scenic easement within the Suburban Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of\nthe public right-of-way.

The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator\nmay require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to preserve\nstructures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(4.) Scenic Corridor Provisions. The following provisions shall govern\ndevelopment within a designated scenic corridor:\n(a.) The area within the scenic easement may be dedicated to the City as a\nconservation easement, provided it meets the standards for such an\neasement as established by applicable state and federal standards.\n(b.) Development density shall be calculated for the entire property, including\nthe area within the scenic easement, with the exception that development\ndensity bonuses of up to 50 percent are given for the portion of the\nproperty within the scenic easement. In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to 75% for the area located within the\nscenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a 10-acre property zoned Single-Family\nResidential (SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic\nCorridor Overlay. The density is calculated as follows:\nBase density @ 3 units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic corridor easement\n50% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 3-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 33units\nIf the Jones' provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a\n75% density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider easement\n75% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 4.5-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 35 units\n(c.) Development may be clustered on the portion of the property located\noutside the scenic easement.\n(5.) Curb Cuts. There shall be a minimum separation of 500' between curb cuts\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 34\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "in the suburban scenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived\nby the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator if the width of the\nproperty frontage would preclude a second curb cut meeting this spacing\nrequirement.\n(6.)

purpose of this Article is to establish standards and specifications for the buildings\nand lots permitted in each of the zoning districts established in Article 8. The standards\nand specifications set forth below are established to ensure that new development and\nconstruction is enduring and compatible with the character of the City of Lowell, that it\naccomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it achieves the goals identified in\nthe adopted City Plan 2040 and other adopted and or approved plans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1 Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Lowell. The\ndetached house building type is generally found in residential neighborhoods,\nalthough it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in commercial or\nmixed-use areas. Where possible, structures should be designed to maintain a\nharmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance. Where\nappropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. For\ndetached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive, building placement and site\nplanning shall be dictated by landscape features and landscape preservation. Within\nthe limits described below and unless the zoning district standards require greater\nmeasures, these regulations shall apply to all houses built in the City of Lowell.\nThe photographs of detached single-family houses in the Carolinas below are\nexamples for illustration purposes only and not intended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\nLowell Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 1\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "9.2-2 Detached House Lot Type.\n(A.)

The multi-family building is a residential building accommodating\nseveral households. In traditional Cities, this building type coexists with a variety of\nother building types and is located in or near mixed use districts. A successful\ncontemporary design permits its integration with other building types through the\ncoordination of site and building design.
