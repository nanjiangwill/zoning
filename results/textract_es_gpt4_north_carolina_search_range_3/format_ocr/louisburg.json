Merely proving that the variance would\npermit a greater profit to be made from the property\nwill not be considered adequate to justify the Board\nin granting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall\nconsider whether the variance is the minimum possible\ndeviation from the terms of the Ordinance that will\nmake possible the reasonable use of the property.\n(2) The hardship results from the application of the\nOrdinance to the property rather than from other\nfactors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n(3) The hardship is due to the physical nature of the\napplicant's property, such as its size, shape, or\ntopography, which is different from that of\nneighboring property.\n(4) The hardship is not the result of the actions of\nthe applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates\nthe Ordinance, or who purchases the property after the\n103\n"}, {"page": "107", "text": "effective date of this Ordinance, and then comes to\nthe Board for relief.\n(5) The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's\nproperty, rather than the result of conditions that\nare widespread.

The Board shall not grant a variance\nif it finds that doing SO would in any respect impair\nthe public health, safety, or general welfare.\n(3) In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto\nsuch conditions regarding the location, character, and other\nfeatures of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may\ndeem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance.\nIf a variance for the construction, alteration or use of\nproperty is granted, such construction, alteration or use shall\nbe in accordance with the approved site plan.\n(4) The Watershed Review Board shall refuse to hear an\nappeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it\nfinds that there have been not substantial changes in conditions\nor circumstances bearing on the appeal or application.\n(5) A variance issued in accordance with this Section shall\nbe considered a Watershed Protection Permit and shall expire if\na\nBuilding Permit or Watershed Occupancy Permit for such use is\nnot obtained by the applicant within six (6) months form the\ndate of the decision.\n(6) If the application calls for the granting of a major\nvariance, and if the Watershed Review Board decides in favor of\nthe granting the variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary\n104\n"}, {"page": "108", "text": "record of the hearing with all deliberate speed.
