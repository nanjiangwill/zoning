LOT PATTERNS\nThe Limited Business (LB) district is established to accommodate various residential and\nnonresidential uses on lots bounding major roadways outside of community and village\ncenter areas. The district is intended to accommodate low intensity commercial, office,\npersonal service, and institutional uses that provide goods and services to county residents\nand visitors in ways that protect the county's scenic corridors as well as maintain the traffic\ncarrying capacity of major roadways. The district also accommodates low density single-\nfamily detached dwellings, accessory dwelling units, and manufactured homes on individual\nlots (on the mainland only). New commercial development is subject to commercial design\nstandards to ensure development quality and consistency with surrounding development\npatterns. New commercial development of 5,000 square feet or more proposed on lots\nlocated outside of areas designated as Full Service areas in the Land Use Plan is required to\nobtain special use permit approval. New development on lots along major arterials (like\nHighway 12) outside designated Full Service areas are subject to increased minimum front\nsetbacks and increased landscaping requirements to help protect the scenic character of\nthese areas. New industrial, multi-family, and institutional residential uses are prohibited in\nthe LB district.\nC.

Such\ncommunities incorporate creative design in the layout of buildings, open space,\nand circulation; assure compatibility with surrounding land uses and\nneighborhood character; and provide greater efficiency in the layout and\nprovision of roads, utilities or other infrastructure.\nB.\nIntent\nThe PD district is intended to be used sparingly under this Ordinance, and only where\nthe development demonstrates innovated design, character, and higher quality\ndevelopment.\nC.\nClassification of Planned Development Zoning Districts\nLand shall be classified into a planned development zoning district only in accordance\nwith the procedures and requirements set forth in Section 2.4.5, Planned Development,\nand this section.\nD.\nRelationship to PUD or RET Overlay Districts\nLands designated as Planned Unit Development (PUD) Overlay or Planned Adult\nRetirement (RET) Overlay on January I, 2013 are subject to the standards and\nconditions included within the previously-adopted sketch plans and other requirements\nrelated to their approval.

The names of these sample uses are generic. They are\nbased on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For\nexample, a use that calls itself \"wholesale sales,\" but sells mostly to consumers,\nis included in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category rather than the\nWholesale Sales Use Category.

A development that contains a coffee\nshop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail Sales and\nService Use Category because all of the development's principal uses are in that use\ncategory.
