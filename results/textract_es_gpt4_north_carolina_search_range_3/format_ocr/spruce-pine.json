Set back requirements from the front, rear or side lot lines.\n2. Lot size requirements.\n3. Parking requirements.\n4. The number, size or location of business signs.\n5. Building height requirements.\nThe existence of a nonconforming use of other land, buildings or structures on adjoining land or other land\nwithin the same use district shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance.\nVariances may be granted in cases upon the finding by the Board of Zoning Adjustment that the following\nconditions exist:\nA. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in\nquestion because of its size, share, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the\nsame district.\nB. Granting of the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges that are\ndenied to other properties in the same use district.\nC.
