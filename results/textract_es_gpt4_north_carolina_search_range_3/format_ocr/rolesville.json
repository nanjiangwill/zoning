CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS\nA. Conservation subdivisions are permitted in accordance with the provisions of Section\n6.3: Conservation Subdivision. Lot standards may differ in conservation subdivisions.\n4.2.9. STREAM PROTECTION BUFFERS AND RIPARIAN BUFFER AREAS REQUIRED\nA. Applicability. Stream protection buffers and riparian protection buffers are required in\naccordance with the requirements in this section. Any activities allowed in the buffer\nshould minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the surface water and\nmaximize the utilization of stormwater best management practices.\nB. Purpose and Intent. Stream protection buffers provide strips of natural vegetation that\nremove pollutants from stormwater runoff before they reach streams or watercourses\nthat eventually drain into a water supply water source. They do so by allowing\ninfiltration of runoff and filtration of pollutants through the ground and soil, slowing\nrunoff flow to allow settling and deposition of pollutants, and providing vegetation that\nabsorbs pollutants through root systems. In addition, these natural buffers preserve\nhabitat for both prolific and endangered wildlife and plant species. Plant and wildlife\npreservation ensures a diverse ecosystem. Finally, stream protection buffers provide\nscenic areas for human recreation and enjoyment. The provision of vegetated,\nundisturbed buffers serve to preserve and protect the quality of our streams and\nwatercourses; to preserve and protect the drinking water sources for our downstream\nneighbors; to preserve and protect habitat to wildlife and plants; and to preserve and\nprotect natural areas for the human recreation and stress relief\nC.

When all the principal uses of a\ndevelopment fall within one (1) use category, then the development is assigned to that\nuse category. For example, a development that contains a retail bakery and a cafe\nwould be classified in the retail sales and service category because all the principal uses\nare in that category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use\ncategories, each principal use is classified separately and is subject to the regulations for\nthat category.\nD. Principal Uses. Each principal use is defined in the following format:\n1. Characteristics. Characteristics are considered the basic definition of a principal\nuse.\n2. Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction with the\nprincipal use unless stated otherwise in the regulations. Accessory uses are\nsubject to the same regulations as the principal use and the general standards for\naccessory uses Section 5.2.\n3. Examples. Common examples are listed for each definition.\n4.

Purpose. Rezoning allows an applicant to modify the zoning of a property and amend\nthe zoning map. This process may allow an applicant to revise the zoning map to\nchange the zoning district classification applicable to a particular parcel, portion of a\nparcel, or group of parcels. There are two (2) types of rezoning authorized by this\nLDO: General Rezoning and Conditional Rezoning.\n1.\nGeneral Rezoning. A general rezoning reclassifies land to a base zoning\ndistrict and subjects future development in the district to all the development\nregulations applicable to that zoning district.\n2.\nConditional Rezoning. A conditional rezoning reclassifies land to a conditional\nzoning district that is parallel to a base zoning district. Consistent with the\ndefinition provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 160D-102, this rezoning is defined as a\nlegislative zoning map amendment with site-specific conditions incorporated\ninto the zoning map amendment. This type of rezoning subjects future\ndevelopment in the district to the same development regulations applicable\nto the parallel base district except as modified by conditions. A conditional\nrezoning shall comply with the below standards:\na. Are proposed and/or agreed upon by the owner(s) of the land;\nb. Incorporate any proposed modifications to use, intensity, or\ndevelopment standards applicable in the parallel base district; and\nC.\nAre limited to conditions that address conformance of the allowable\ndevelopment and use of the rezoning site with Town regulations and\nROLESVILLE LDO -ADOPTED - 6-1-2021; AMENDED 4-4-2023\nSECTION 2 - LEGISLATIVE PROCESSES PAGE 7\n"}, {"page": "372", "text": "TOWN OF ROLESVILLE APPENDIX A - LDO HANDBOOK\nadopted plans and impacts reasonably expected to be generated by\nthe allowable development or use of the site.\nd. A site plan may be approved as part of a conditional zoning. If it is\nincorporated as a condition in conditional zoning, it is part of that\nlegislative decision. If it is required and approved as part of an\nadministrative or evidentiary decision, it is a development approval.\ne.\nConditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional district\nshall be limited to those that address the conformance of the\ndevelopment and use of the site to Town ordinances, or the impacts\nreasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the\nsite.\nB.

An application for a general rezoning may be amended to a conditional\nrezoning application before the public hearing.\nC. Review Process.\n1.\nRezoning applications shall occur through a public hearing process and shall\nbe reviewed by the LDA and TRC for consistency with the regulations of the\nLDO and any other relevant Town ordinances and adopted plans.\n2. A staff report by the Planning Department shall be provided to the PB and\nBOC.\nD.

Would the application result in a logical and orderly development pattern; and\n7. Would the application result in adverse impacts on water, air, noise, storm\nwater management, wildlife, vegetation, wetlands, and the natural\nfunctioning of the environment.\n8. If a conditional rezoning, the BOC may also consider if the conditional\nrezoning addresses the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the\ndevelopment or use of the site, can reasonably be implemented and enforced\nfor the subject property, and if it will mitigate specific issues that would likely\nresult if the subject property were zoned to accommodate all the uses and the\nminimum standards of the corresponding general zoning district.\nROLESVILLE LDO - ADOPTED 6-1-2021; AMENDED 4-4-2023\nSECTION 2 - LEGISLATIVE PROCESSES PAGE 11\n"}, {"page": "376", "text": "TOWN OF ROLESVILLE APPENDIX A - LDO HANDBOOK\n2.4.

The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6,\nArticle 21 of Chapter 143; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Article 7, 9, and 11 of N.C. Gen.\nStat. \u00a7 160D (Effective July 1, 2021) of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to\nlocal governmental units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the\npublic health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the\nTown of Rolesville, North Carolina, does ordain as follows in this section.\nB. Findings of Fact.\n1. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Rolesville are subject\nto periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety\nhazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary\npublic expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax\nbase, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the\noccupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nC. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote public health, safety,\nand general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions\nwithin flood prone areas by provisions designed to:\n1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due\nto water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood\nheights or velocities;\n2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses,\nbe protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\nROLESVILLE LDO - ADOPTED 6-1-2021\nSECTION 1.1.

Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase\nerosion or flood damage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert\nflood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD. Objectives. The objectives of this section are to:\n1. Protect human life, safety, and health;\n2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains,\nelectric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located\nin flood prone areas;\n6. Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;\n7. Make flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood\nInsurance Program;\n8. Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;\n9. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development\nof flood prone areas; and\n10. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard\nArea.\n1.1.2. DEFINITIONS\nA.

Findings. It is hereby determined that Development and Redevelopment alter the\nhydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and\nvolumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source\npollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater\nrecharge. These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and\nwell-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from Development sites. Further,\nthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (\"Clean Water Act\") and federal Phase II\nStormwater Rules promulgated under it compel the Town to adopt minimum\nstormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance. Therefore, the Town\nestablishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements\nof state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge.\nD. Purpose.\n1. General. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the\npublic health, safety, environment, and general welfare by establishing minimum\nrequirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-\nDevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution\nassociated with new Development and Redevelopment as well as illicit\ndischarges into municipal stormwater systems.\n2.
