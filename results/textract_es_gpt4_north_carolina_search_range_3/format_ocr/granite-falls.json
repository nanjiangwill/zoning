If the two following criteria apply, the\nPlanning Board may reduce the sidewalk requirement in specific portions of the development from two\nsides of the street to one side of the street, or in very rare instances allow for the elimination of sidewalks:\nTopography is extremely rugged and hilly.\nEighty (80%) percent or more of the development is within a Critical Area water supply\nwatershed.\n2.\nOn-street parking is recommended where building type and use will generate regular use. Occasional\non-street parking can be accommodated without additional pavement width. For streets which serve\nworkplace and storefront buildings, on-street parking lanes are required and should be marked as such.\nAn on-street parking lane on at least one side of the street is recommended on streets serving apartments,\nattached houses, and detached houses with lots 60' or less in width. On-street parking should also be\nprovided on one side of any street adjacent to a square, park or other Urban Open Space. Parallel on-\nstreet parking width is 7' to 8'. On-street parking should be parallel; angled parking is only permitted\nalong the main streets of a retail center in a planned mixed-use development.\n3. Design speeds should not exceed 30 miles per hour on any neighborhood street. Only arterials and\nboulevards may exceed this design speed.\n4.\nStreets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and\nconnect to existing and projected streets outside the development. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed two\nhundred fifty (250) feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external\nconnectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are permitted where\ntopography makes a street connection impracticable. In most instances, a \"close\" or \"eyebrow\" is\npreferred to a cul-de-sac. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable SO long as\nemergency access is adequately provided.\n5.\nThe average perimeter of all blocks should not exceed one thousand three hundred fifty (1,350) feet.\nNo block face should have a length greater than eight hundred (800) feet without a dedicated alley or\npathway providing through access.\n6. Streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of\nstreets shall be indicated on the submitted sketch plan. Each street type shall be separately detailed.\nStreet types illustrated in the subdivision ordinance and TND street design guidelines represent the\narray of elements that are combined to meet the purposes of neighborhood streets: building placement\nline, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip, curb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and\ntravel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements will be considered to\nallow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n7.\nTo prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure,\nlong uninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods: (1) a street can be\ninterrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and terminate\n65\n"}, {"page": "66", "text": "vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature); (2) a street can be terminated with a\npublic monument, specifically designed building fa\u00e7ade, or a gateway to the ensuing space; (3) perceived\nstreet length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve and deflect the view; (4) other traffic calming\nconfigurations are acceptable SO long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n8.\nStreet construction standards shall conform to the standards in the Granite Falls Subdivision Ordinance.\n612.6.4) Special District Conditions.\n1.\nAccessory uses and structures that are clearly related to and incidental to the permitted principal\nuse or structure on the lot.\n2.\nFences and walls.\n(a) In a residential district a fence or wall in the established front yard or a building shall be a\nminimum of two (2) feet in height and a maximum of five (5) feet in height.

An example of\na permanent structural element which provides such screening would be an elevated porch\nor stoop with steps to ground level.\n(c) In no case shall on-site residential parking extend into the public right-of-way, or into an\neasement for a public sidewalk on private property.\n(d) On street parking at lot front, when specifically provided, may be counted toward all or\npart of the parking requirement of a dwelling unit.\n(e) Vehicles used primarily for commercial purposes and with more than two (2) axles are\nprohibited from parking on streets, in driveways, or on private property in residential\ndistricts. This shall not be construed as preventing the temporary parking of delivery\ntrucks, moving vans, and similar vehicles which deliver goods or services.\n4.\nHome Occupation: A home occupation is permitted accessory to any dwelling unit (except\nmanufactured housing) in accordance with the following requirements:\n(a) The home occupation must be clearly incidental to the residential use of the dwelling and\nmust not change the essential residential character of the dwelling.\n66\n"}, {"page": "67", "text": "(b) The use shall employ no more than one (1) person who is not a resident of the dwelling.\n(c) A home occupation housed within the dwelling shall occupy no more than twenty-five\n(25) percent of the total floor area of the dwelling.\n(d) There shall be no visible outside display of stock in trade which is sold on the premises.\n(e) There shall be no outdoor storage or visible evidence of equipment or materials used in\nthe home occupation, excepting equipment or materials of a type and quantity that could\nreasonably be associated with the principal residential use.\n(f) Operation of the home occupation shall not be visible from any dwelling on an adjacent\nlot, nor from a street.\n(g) Only vehicles used primarily as passenger vehicles will be permitted in connection with\nthe conduct of the home occupation.\n(h) The home occupation shall not utilize mechanical, electrical, or other equipment which\nproduces noise, electrical or magnetic interference, vibration, heat, glare, or other\nnuisances outside the dwelling or accessory structure housing the home occupation.\n(i) Home occupations shall be limited to those uses which do not draw clients to the\ndwelling on a regular basis.\n(j) Outdoor kilns used for the firing of pottery shall be provided with a semi-opaque screen\nto obstruct the view from the street and from adjacent properties located in residential\ndistricts, shall have a secured work area, and shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet from\nabutting property lines.\n(k) No business identification or advertising signs are permitted.\n(1) Must also follow all provisions of section 712, home occupations.\n5. Standards for construction; Developer responsibility\n(a) Where standards responsibility for infrastructure construction, including but not limited to\nstreets, sidewalks, and landscaping, are specified in this document or in the subdivision\nregulations of the Town of Granite Falls, town standards shall control.\n(b) Each owner, developer or primary builder (permit holder) shall be responsible for damage\nand undue service caused due to their activity. Further, it shall be the responsibility of all\ndevelopers to make contractors and suppliers aware of the requirements and it shall be the\nresponsibility of the permittee to recover costs from their service providers.\n(c)\nThe town shall charge permittees for costs incurred in correcting or addressing any such\nmatters.
