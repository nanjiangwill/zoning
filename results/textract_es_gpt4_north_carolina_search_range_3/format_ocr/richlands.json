However, mere financial hardship does not\nconstitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.\n(D) This section applies only to undeveloped non-conforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures\nupon it. A change in use of a developed non-conforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with \u00a7 153.035.\n(E) Subject to the following sentence, if, on the date this section becomes effective, an undeveloped non-conforming lot\nadjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the\nowner of the non-conforming lot, nor his or her successors in interest, may take advantage of the provisions of this section.\nThis division (E) shall not apply to a non-conforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street\nwhere such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also non-conforming. The intent of this division (E) is to require\nnon-conforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified\nherein, but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has\npreviously been developed.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.033 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS.\n(A) Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the\nextent of non-conformity of a non-conforming situation. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new\nstructures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in:\n(1) An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a non-conforming use; or\n(2) Greater non-conformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or\ndensity requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements.\n(B) Subject to division (D) below, a non-conforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building\nthat, when the use was made non-conforming by this chapter, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such\nuse. In addition, a non-conforming use may be extended to additional buildings located on the premises or to unimproved\nland outside the original building or the additional buildings upon the issuance of a special use permit by the Board of\nAdjustment which authorizes such additional non-conforming use. Review and action on said special use permit shall be\nbased on the criteria contained in \u00a7 153.347.\n(C) Subject to \u00a7 153.037, a non-conforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied\nby that use when it became non-conforming; except that, a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot\n(e.g., a quarry) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became non-\nconforming if 10% or more of the earth products had already been removed at the effective date of this chapter.\n(D) The volume, intensity or frequency of use or property where a non-conforming situation exists may be increased, and\nthe equipment or processes used at a location where a non-conforming situation exists may be changed, if these or similar\nchanges amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind, and no violations of other paragraphs\nof this section occur.\n(E) Notwithstanding division (A) above, any stick-built structure used for single-family residential purposes (other than\nmanufactured homes) and maintained as a non-conforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a\nlarger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new non-conformities or increase the extent of\nexisting non-conformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements. With the following exceptions,\nmanufactured homes used for single-family residential purposes may be enlarged or replaced in accordance with this\ndivision (E); provided, however, said enlargement or expansion in the case of those manufactured homes that have\nremained vacant beyond the 180-day discontinuance period shall be prohibited by this chapter. This division (E) is subject to\nthe limitations stated in \u00a7 153.036. These exceptions are as follows.\n(1) Manufactured homes on individual lots in any commercial, office and institutional district may not be replaced by\nanother manufactured home of any class.\n(2) Manufactured homes on individual lots in the R-10 and R-15 Zoning Districts may only be replaced by Class A\nmanufactured homes on permanent foundations with brick or masonry underpinning.\n(F) (1) Notwithstanding division (A) above, whenever:\n(a) There exists a lot with one or more structures on it;\n(b) A change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot; and\n(c) The parking requirements of 153.205 through 153.217 that would be applicable as a result of the proposed\nchange cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used\nfor parking, then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a non-\nconforming situation.\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "(2) However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be\nsatisfied without acquiring additional land, and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with \u00a7 153.214\nif:\n(a) Parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required; and\n(b) Such satellite parking is reasonably available.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.034 REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION.\n(A) Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where non-conforming situations exist are permitted and\nencouraged. Major renovation (i.e., work estimated to cost more than 75% of the appraised valuation of the structure prior to\ndamage and/or renovation) may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section.\n(B) If a structure located on a lot where a non-conforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair\nor replacement would exceed 75% of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be\nrepaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. This division (B) does not\napply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning\npermit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in \u00a7 153.033(E).\n(C) (1) For purposes of divisions (A) and (B) above:\n(a) The COST of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services\nnecessary to accomplish such renovation, repair or replacement;\n(b) The COST of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work, and no\nperson may seek to avoid the intent of divisions (A) and (B) above by doing such work incrementally; and\n(c) The APPRAISED VALUATION shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as\nnecessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a\nprofessionally recognized property appraiser.\n(2) It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to supply the town with the appraised valuation of the property.\nSaid valuation shall include the necessary documentation to support the valuation.\n(D) (1) The Zoning Administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he or she finds that, in completing the\nrenovation, repair or replacement work:\n(a) No violation of \u00a7 153.033 will occur; and\n(b) The permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this chapter applicable to the\nexisting use (except that the permittee shall not lose his or her right to continue a non-conforming use, except for those\nreasons outlined in \u00a7 153.036).\n(2) Compliance with a requirement of this subchapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved\nwithout adding additional land to the lot where the non-conforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure\nthat is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved\nparking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.035 CHANGE IN USE OF PROPERTY WHERE A NON-CONFORMING SITUATION EXISTS.\n(A) A change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning or special use permit in accordance\nwith \u00a7 153.340(A) may not be made, except in accordance with divisions (B) through (D) below. However, this requirement\nshall not apply if only a sign permit is needed.\n(B) If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, and\nall of the other requirements of this chapter applicable to that use can be complied with, permission to make the change\nmust be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this\nchapter is achieved, the property may not revert to its non-conforming status.\n(C) If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, but\nall of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is\npermissible if the Zoning Administrator issues a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the Zoning\nAdministrator finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this chapter, that:\n(1) The intended change will not result in a violation of $153.033; and\n(2) All of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with.\nCompliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding\nadditional land to the lot where the non-conforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a\npermanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not\nconstitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.

The Zoning Administrator may issue the permit if it finds, in\naddition to other findings that may be required by this chapter, that:\n(1) The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning or special use permit;\n(2) All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in division (C) above are satisfied; and\n(3) The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more\ncompatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7\n153.036 ABANDONMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS.\n(A) When a non-conforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days, the property involved may\nthereafter be used only for conforming purposes, except as detailed in division (F) below.\n(B) If the principal activity on property where a non-conforming situation other than a non-conforming use exists is\ndiscontinued for a continuous period of 180 days, then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the\nregulations applicable to the preexisting use, unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use (i.e., the\nBoard of Adjustment) issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the non-conforming\nsituations. This permit may be issued if the Board of Adjustment finds that eliminating a particular non-conformity is not\nreasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the non-conforming\nsituation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify which\nnon-conformities need not be corrected.\n(C) For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a non-conforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all\nof the buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the\nfailure to rent one apartment in a non-conforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent\nthat apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. Likewise, if a\nnon- conforming building remains on the market for rent or sale and fails to be rented within a 180-day period, the said non-\nconforming building shall be allowed to continue as a non-conformity so long as there is evidence of the owner's intention to\nactively rent or sell the said building.\n(D) If a non-conforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a non-conforming use\nfor the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.\n(E) (1) When a structure or operation made non-conforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective\ndate of this chapter, the 180-day period for purposes of this section begins to run at the effective date of this chapter.\n(2) It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to determine \"substantial\" compliance with the minimum standards\nset forth above, along with other applicable standards specified by this chapter. The determination of the Zoning Officer must\nbe set forth in writing and must include an affirmative assertion by him or her that:\n(a) The continuance of the non-conforming residential dwelling will contribute to the preservation of the existing\nhousing stock and not result in an increase in any non-conformity;\n(b) The continuance of the non-conforming residential dwelling will provide the occupants thereof with decent, safe\nand sanitary housing; and\n(c) The continuance of the non-conforming residential dwelling will be in general conformity with the town's objectives\nof providing affordable housing opportunities for its citizens and/or encouraging historic preservation.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.037 COMPLETION OF NON-CONFORMING PROJECTS.\n(A) All non-conforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the effective date of this\nchapter as well as all non-conforming projects that are at least 25% completed in terms of the total expected cost of the\nproject on the effective date of this chapter may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as\nthese permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed in\nstages, this division (A) shall apply only to the particular phase under construction.\n(B) Except as provided in division (A) above, all work on any non-conforming project shall cease on the effective date of\nthis chapter, and all permits previously issued for work on non-conforming projects shall be revoked as of that date.\nThereafter, work on non-conforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning, special use, or sign\npermit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or board authorized by this chapter to issue permits for the\ntype of development proposed. The permit-issuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has, in\ngood faith, made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his or her\nposition in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this\nchapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his or her project as proposed.

An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure.\n(3) To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced\nby having made those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some\nexpenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new\nclassification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property.\n(4) To the extent that a non-conforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations\nincurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by\nhaving made such expenditures.\n(5) An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of:\n(a) The total estimated cost of the proposed project; and\n(b) The ordinary business practices of the developer.\n(6) A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use\nlaw affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him or her.\n(7) Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use affecting a development site, the\npermit-issuing authority may still find that he or she acted in good faith if he or she did not proceed with his or her plans in a\ndeliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance. The permit-issuing authority may find that the\ndeveloper did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that:\n(a) At the time the expenditures were made, either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would\nultimately be passed, or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development; and\n(b) The developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.\n(C) The permit-issuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by division (B) above that is\nsubmitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this chapter. The permit-issuing authority may waive this requirement\nfor good cause shown, but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year.\n(D) The permit-issuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this\nsection, so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted.\n(E) When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that the non-conforming project was intended to be or\nreasonably could be completed in stages, segments or other discrete units, the permit-issuing authority shall not allow the\nnon-conforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to\nensure reasonable completion of the project.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.038 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.\n(A) No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of non-conformity of a non-conforming\nsign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no non-conforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner\nas to aggravate the non-conforming condition. Nor may illumination be added to any non-conforming sign.\n(B) A non-conforming sign may not be moved or replaced, except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this\nchapter.\n(C) If a non-conforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed or replaced,\nexcept in conformity with all the provisions of this chapter, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared\nfrom the land. For purposes of this section, a non-conforming sign is \"destroyed\" if damaged to the extend that the cost of\nrestoring the sign to its former stature, or replacing it with an equivalent sign, equals or exceeds 50% of its value as listed for\ntax purposes by the County Tax Administrator.\n(D) The message of a non-conforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create new non-conformities (for\nexample, by creating an off-premises sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed).\n(E) Subject to the other provisions of this section, non-conforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the\ncost of such work within any 12-month period does not exceed the lesser of:\n(1) Its fair market value; or\n(2) Its most current tax value.\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\nZONING DISTRICTS\n\u00a7 153.050 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.\n(A) The following residential districts are hereby established: A-5, R-20, R-15, R-10, RM-10, R-8, RM-8, R-6 and RM-6.\nThe purpose of each residential district is to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe and\npleasant environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly belong in non-\nresidential districts.\n(B) The A-5, R-20, R-15, R-10, RM-10, R-8, RM-8, R-6 and RM-6 Districts differ primarily in the density and dimensional\nrequirements as contained in \u00a7\u00a7 153.135 through 153.146 and in uses allowed as contained in $153.080:\n(1) The A-5 Agriculture District is designed to secure the agricultural integrity of the areas so classified and to allow for\nlow-density single-family development on five-acre minimum lots.

and\n(3) The use of any motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold\nor stored, any service is performed, or other business is conducted (as defined in Ch. 114 of this code of ordinances);\nexcept that the following shall not be prohibited solely by this division (C)(3):\n(a) Retail sales of food products and goods manufactured, created or produced by the seller;

or is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then that\nuse which meets the criteria enumerated in divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) below may be regarded as accessory to the principal\nuse and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use; provided that the accessory\nuse is of equal or lesser zoning classification.\n(2) For example, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a\nresidential subdivision or multi-family development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though\nsuch facilities, if developed apart from a residential development, would require a special use permit.\n(B) For purposes of interpreting division (A) above:\n(1) A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to\nthe principal use; and\n(2) To be \"commonly associated\" with a principal use means that the association of the accessory use with such\nprincipal use takes place with sufficient frequency to establish a common acceptance of their relatedness.\n(C) Without limiting the generality of divisions (A) and (B) above, the following activities are specifically regarded as\naccessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above:\n(1) Hobbies or recreational activities of a non-commercial nature; except that, the repair of automobiles owned by\npersons who do not reside on the premises, is prohibited;\n(2) The renting out of one room within a single-family residence (which one room does not in itself constitute a separate\ndwelling unit) to not more than one person who is not part of the family that resides in the single-family dwelling; and\n(3) Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three days\n(whether consecutive or not) during any 90-day period.\n(D) Without limiting the generality of divisions (A) and (B) above, the following activities shall not be regarded as\naccessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts:\n(1) Parking outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than four motor vehicles between the front building line of\nthe principal building and the street on any lot used for purposes that fall within the principal use of a residence (single- or\nmulti-family); and\n(2) Parking and storage outside a substantially enclosed structure of any motor home boat or other recreational vehicle\nbetween the front building line of the principal building and the street on which the lot fronts. The prohibited vehicles include\ntrailers and commercial vehicles.

For example, if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of the building moves\nout and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within the scope of\ngeneral retail. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use\nsince the type of business or enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space\nin a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use since there is more\nthan one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center - combination\nuse) has not changed.\n(B) A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in\nuse. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to\nany intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied\nfor more than 180 continuous days or there has been no affirmative attempt or expressed intention on the part of the\nproperty owner to rent, sell or use the property.\n(C) A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise shall not be regarded as a change in use.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.087 COMBINATION USES.\n(A) When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits (zoning or\nspecial use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be:\n(1) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit; and\n(2) A zoning permit in all other cases.\n(B) Subject to division (C) below, when a combination use consists of a residential subdivision and a multi-family\ndevelopment, the total density permissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the\nportion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a\nseparate lot.\n(C) (1) Notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 153.136(B) and 153.137(B), whenever:\n(a) A combination use consists of a standard residential subdivision and a multi-family development; and\n(b) The subdivided portion of the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in \u00a7\n153.136, but that do not exceed an average of 20,000 square feet, then the density of the portion of the tract developed for\nmulti-family purposes may be increased beyond the permissible density calculated in accordance with division (B) below.\n(2) The increase in density shall be determined as follows:\n(a) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted from each lot that exceeds\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "the minimum lot size, and the remainders totaled.\n(b) The sum derived from the calculation in division (C)(1)(a) above shall be divided by the minimum lot size\nrequirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\n(c) The product of the calculation in division (C)(1)(b) above shall yield the number of additional multi-family dwelling\nunits that may be located within the portion of the tract developed for multi-family purposes.\n(D) When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a commercial district, the lot used for the residential\nuse must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential use alone.\n(E) When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for the combination use shall be\ndetermined by calculating the amount of parking required for each individual principal use according to the relative amount\nof space occupied by that use.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.088 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.\n(A) In a planned unit development, the developer may make use of the land for any purpose authorized in the particular\nPUD in which the land is located, subject to the provisions of this chapter. Section 153.054 describes the various types of\nPUDs.\n(B) Within any tract in a residential zoning district developed as a residential/commercial PUD, not more than 10% of the\ntotal tract area may be developed for purposes that are permissible only in a commercial zoning district.

For purposes of\ndetermining the substantive regulations that apply to the planned unit development, each portion of the tract so designated\nshall then be treated as if it were a separate district, zoned to permit, respectively, residential, commercial or industrial uses.\nHowever, only one permit (a planned unit development permit) shall be issued for the entire development. Said permit may\nbe issued by the Zoning Administrator following subdivision general plan approval.\n(D) The non-residential portions of any planned unit development may not be occupied until all of the residential portions\nof the development are completed or their completion is assured by any of the mechanisms provided in \u00a7\u00a7 153.340 through\n153.363 to guarantee completion.

For example, a small doctor's\noffice or clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and\ndesigned to attract customers or clients to the premises). However, classification 3.130 (physicians and dentist offices and\nclinics occupying not more than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area) more specifically covers this use and therefore is\ncontrolling.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.090 GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.\n(A) Encroachments permitted into required yard setbacks.\n(1) Interior lots.

A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet, with intermittent\nvisual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude\ncompletely all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque screen may\nbe composed of a wall, fence, planted earth berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation or any combination thereof. For\nevery linear 100 feet, or fraction thereof, the screen shall consist of an average of three canopy type trees, each with a\nminimum caliper of two inches. Said trees in five years shall reach a height of at least 20 feet and shall have an average\ncanopy spread of 15 feet. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. If shrubbery is used,\nsaid shrubbery shall be evergreen plant materials and be spaced to provide a solid screen in two years. If fences or walls are\nused, said fences or walls shall be masonry, wood, metal or other suitable materials (not to include chain-link fencing) and\nshall have architectural character and be of substantial materials. A graphic illustration of the sample planting pattern is\nincluded in \u00a7\u00a7 153.285 through 153.290.\n(B) Semi-opaque screen, type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual\nobstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 20 feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially\nblock visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen\nmay be composed of a wall, fence, planted earth berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation or any combination thereof.\nFor every linear 100 feet, or fraction thereof, the screen shall consist of an average of two canopy type trees, each with a\nminimum caliper of two inches. Said trees in five years shall reach a height of at least 20 feet and shall have an average\ncanopy spread of 15 feet. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. If shrubbery is used,\nsaid shrubbery shall be evergreen plant materials and be spaced to provide a solid screen in two years. If fences or walls are\nused, said fences or walls shall be masonry, wood, metal or other suitable materials (not to include chain-link fencing) and\nshall have architectural character and be of substantial materials. A graphic illustration of a sample planting pattern is\nincluded in \u00a7\u00a7 153.285 through 153.290.\n(C) Broken screen, type C. screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least\n20 feet. The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating\nvisual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, planted earth berm, planted vegetation, existing\nvegetation or any combination thereof. For every linear 100 feet, or fraction thereof, the screen may consist of a\ncombination of at least two canopy or ornamental type trees, each having a minimum caliper of at least two inches, and\nshrubbery three feet in height that covers an average of 20% of the screen area, or five canopy or ornamental type trees,\neach having a minimum caliper of two inches.

For the purposes of this chapter, THINNING shall be defined as an intermediate harvest in a forest stand that\nreduces tree density and competition for the benefit of remaining trees intended to be harvested at a later date. THINNING\nshall also be defined as the removal of selected trees from a site for the purpose of non-forestry-related site development,\nexcluding tree cutting necessary for maintenance of existing utilities or the control of diseases and pests. CLEARCUTTING\nshall be defined as any activity that involves the total removal of trees from a tract of land for the purpose of harvesting and\nregeneration or non-forestry-related site development.

The 25-foot buffer shall consist of a\ncombination of regulated trees and understory (underbrush) vegetation. For purposes of this division (F)(1), REGULATED\nTREES shall be defined as any tree that meets or exceeds the average caliper size calculated for the forest stand under\nconsideration for timber harvesting. (Note: In situations where the number of regulated trees in a given buffer is less than\nthe retention standard found in the chart below, trees that come closest to meeting the dbh standard for the given tract shall\nbe considered \"regulated trees\" for the purpose of satisfying this requirement.) Average tree size shall be determined by\nmeasuring trees at four and one-half feet above ground (commonly referred to as diameter breast height (dbh)). The\nminimum number of regulated trees retained per linear 100 feet of a 25-foot wide buffer shall be in accordance with the\nfollowing graduated scale based on the forest stand's average dbh:\n(b) Retained regulated trees shall be evenly distributed throughout the buffer area. The buffer shall also consist of\nnaturally growing understory (underbrush) vegetation that has the effect of providing additional screening. Such understory\n(underbrush) vegetation shall remain in an undisturbed state, to the extent practicable to allow for the removal of selected\ntrees in the designated buffer area. Further, timber harvesting in the buffer will be authorized at such time as the understory\ntrees reach the average dbh standards listed on the above scale or following receipt by the permit-issuing authority of a site\ndevelopment plan that meets the requirements of this chapter.\n1. The intent of this division (F)(1) is to:\na. Lessen the impact of timber harvesting activities on surrounding properties;\nb. Provide for ongoing reforestation of the buffer in a manner that ensures the health of the trees; and\nC. Provide an opportunity to incorporate existing vegetation into a future site development scheme.\n2. This division (F)(1) shall not apply to a lot on which a single-family residential structure has been or is to be\nconstructed.\n(2) (a) For tracts of land that are greater than five acres in size, the owner/developer shall retain a minimum 50-foot\ntree/vegetation buffer along all property lines that abut a residential use or residential zoning district. A 25-foot\ntree/vegetation buffer shall be retained along all other property lines, except those adjoining other lands devoted to\nrecognized timber-harvesting operations at the time of thinning or clearcutting. The 50-foot buffer shall consist of a\ncombination of regulated trees and understory (underbrush) vegetation. For purposes of this division (F)(2), REGULATED\nTREES shall be defined as any tree that meets or exceeds the average caliper size calculated for the forest stand under\nconsideration for timber harvesting.

Provide for ongoing reforestation of the buffer in a manner that ensures the health of the trees; and\nC. Provide an opportunity to incorporate existing vegetation into a future site development scheme.\n(3) In lieu of the retention of existing trees and understory (underbrush) vegetation in the case of clearcutting activities\nas outlined under divisions (F)(1) and (F)(2) above, the owner/developer shall have the option of removing all said trees and\nunderstory vegetation from the site and installing a newly planted buffer.

A\ntype \"C\", broken screen, as defined in \u00a7 153.233, shall be installed along all other property lines where a buffer is required\nunder divisions (F)(1) and (F)(2) above. Said screen shall be installed within three months of the completion of clearcutting\nactivities in the designated buffer zone area. Said plant buffer shall be planted within ten feet of the property line, unless site\nconditions dictate otherwise in which case the buffer shall be installed at the closest possible point to the property line. In the\ncase of ongoing timber harvesting operations where replanting is to occur, seedlings planted for the purpose of harvest shall\nnot be planted within the 25-foot and 50-foot buffer zones.\n(4) (a) In the event a tract of land proposed for clearcutting is located adjacent to a developed tract of land that\nalready has a buffer in place that meets the standards for screening set forth in \u00a7 153.233, the Zoning Administrator may\nwaive all or part of the buffering requirement along the property line abutting said development if he or she finds that:\n1. The adjoining property buffer is established to such a degree that it completely excludes all visual contact\nbetween uses and creates a strong impression of spatial separation; and\n2. Adequate legal mechanisms are in place to ensure the preservation of the buffer for the life of the development.\n(b) If, however, an owner of timberland which abuts a developed tract of land decides to develop his or her property\nafter clearcutting the same, but before new growth forms a suitable buffer between the two tracts of land, the forest\nowner/developer must provide an acceptable opaque screen, as prescribed by \u00a7 153.233, along the line of his or her\nproperty adjoining the developed tract of land.\n(5)\nIf no site plan for development or forestry management/tree replanting plan is submitted in conjunction with the\napplication of a zoning permit for total harvesting of a site, the owner/developer of said property shall replant a minimum of\n23 trees per acre, each with a minimum caliper of two inches, at the time the site is developed. This requirement shall run\nwith the land until the property is initially developed, regardless of any change in ownership. The intent of this replanting\nrequirement is to discourage the wholesale removal of trees from the site in an effort solely to market or make the property\navailable for development without providing an opportunity to incorporate existing vegetation in the development scheme.\nThis division (F)(5) shall not apply to recognized timber-harvesting operations where more intensive tree replanting is to\noccur.\n(6) The owner/developer shall be responsible for leaving the site in a clean condition with all major limbs, stumps and\nexcess debris removed. (Note: Stump and limb removal will not be required if retention of such timber debris is a necessary\npart of the forest regeneration process in accordance with an established forestry management plan or BMP.) The intent of\nthis provision is to discourage the retention of timbering debris on-site which could pose a fire hazard in developed areas.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.255 PROTECTION OF REGULATED TREES.\n(A) (1) The Board of Aldermen recognizes the importance of adequately protecting trees during the construction phase\nof developments. To this end, no excavation or other subsurface disturbances may be undertaken within the critical root\nzone of a tree. The critical root zone is defined as the ground area around a tree trunk with a radius (in feet) that is twice the\ndiameter of the tree (in inches) measured at breast height (e.g., a ten-inch diameter tree requires a 20-foot radius of\nCELL (1, 1): \nAverage DBH in Forest Stand (In Inches)\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum # of Regulated Trees Retained in\nBuffer\nCELL (2, 1): \n12 and over\nCELL (2, 2): \n9\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "protection). Said critical root zone shall be marked by means of a barrier fence that meets the design construction standards\ncontained in \u00a7\u00a7 153.285 through 153.290.\n(2) In cases where, because of utility extension, sidewalk installation or other site improvements, it is neither prudent\nnor possible to avoid land disturbance activity in the critical root zone area, the developer shall, upon consultation with the\nZoning Administrator and town groundskeeper, be responsible for providing the town with a root disturbance mitigation plan\nwhich shall outline a specific course of action for minimizing damage to a tree's root system.\n(B) If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of division (A)\nabove and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 153.205 through 153.217 cannot be satisfied, the number\nof\nrequired spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces \"lost\" up to a maximum of 15% of the required spaces.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.256 SHADE TREES IN PARKING AREAS.\n(A) (1) Vehicle accommodation areas that are required to be paved hereby must be shaded by canopy type trees\n(either retained or planted by developer).\n(2) When trees are planted by the developer to satisfy the requirements of this division (A) above, the developer shall\nchoose trees that meet the standards set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 153.285 through 153.290.\n(B) For purposes of achieving the objectives of this section, parking lots shall be designed so that one tree planting area\nis provided for every ten parking spaces (as further outlined herein).\n(C) Trees planted or retained shall be located in an area of at least 162 square feet of unpaved pervious area (the\nequivalent of one standard nine feet by 18 feet parking space).\n(D) Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking trees. Vehicles will be\npresumed to have a body overhang of three feet six inches.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.257 REQUIRED TREES ALONG DEDICATED RESIDENTIAL STREETS.\nAlong both sides of all newly created residential streets with respect to which an offer of dedication is required to be made\nby this chapter, the developer shall either plant or retain sufficient trees so that, between the paved portion of the street and\na line running parallel to and 50 feet from the centerline of the street, there is for every 30 feet of street frontage at least an\naverage of one canopy tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter. When trees are\nplanted by the developer pursuant to this section, the developer shall choose trees that have a minimum two-inch caliper at\nplanting and meet the standards set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 153.285 through 153.290.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\nPLANTING\n\u00a7 153.270 DEFINITION.\nFor purposes of this subchapter, the term PLANTING shall mean any live plant material such as trees, shrubs, ground\ncover and grass used in spaces void of any impervious material or building structure, areas left in their natural state or areas\nwhere mulch is used as ground cover.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.271 BOARD FINDINGS CONCERNING THE NEED FOR PLANTING REQUIREMENTS.\nThe Board of Aldermen finds that:\n(A) Planting has an important impact on better control of flood problems, soil erosion, air and noise pollution and making\nthe town a healthier, safer and more aesthetically pleasing place in which to live and work;\n(B) Planting is an invaluable physical, aesthetic and psychological element of the urban setting, making urban life more\ncomfortable by providing shade and cooling;\n(C) Planting can serve as screening which can provide an impression of separation of spaces and a greater sense of\nprivacy from visual or physical intrusion;\n(D) Planting has an important role in filtering wastewater passing through the ground from the surface to groundwater\ntables and lower aquifers;\n(E) For the reasons indicated in division (B) above, planting has an important impact on the desirability of land and\nconsequently on property values; and\n(F) The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n"}, {"page": "84", "text": "\u00a7 153.272 COMPLIANCE WITH PLANTING REQUIREMENTS.\n(A) A planting plan on all commercial, office and institutional, industrial, multi-family, planned unit developments and non-\nresidential uses in a residential district shall be required according to the following minimum specifications:\n(1) Of developments less than one acre, 20% of the total lot area shall be planted;\n(2) Of developments of one acre or more, 25% of the total lot area shall be planted;\n(3) Of developments of two acres or more, 20% of the total lot area shall be planted; and\n(4) Of developments of three acres or more, 15% of the total lot area shall be planted.\n(B) Planting plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect licensed in the state or persons with a minimum of three\nyears' experience in the preparation of planting plans for commercial developments.

Such plans as are\nfinally approved are incorporated into any permit issued in reliance thereon, and, except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 153.356,\nall development shall occur strictly in accordance with such approved plans.\n(3) A zoning permit, special use permit or sign permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant (as defined in \u00a7\n153.341), and shall identify the property involved and the proposed use, shall incorporate by reference the plans submitted\nand shall contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing authority.\n(B) Issuance of a special use or zoning permit authorizes the recipient to commence the activity resulting in a change in\nuse of the land, or (subject to obtaining a building permit) to commence work designed to construct, erect, move or\nsubstantially alter buildings or other substantial structures, or to undertake activities not specifically prescribed by ordinance,\nbut which are deemed to reflect the intent of the ordinance. However, except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 153.346, 153.352 and\n153.353, the intended use may not be commenced, no building may be occupied, and no activities not specifically\nprescribed by ordinance may be undertaken until all of the requirements of this chapter and/or all additional requirements\nimposed pursuant to the issuance of a special use permit have been complied with.\n(C) An approval made pursuant to this chapter attaches to and runs with the land.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.341 WHO MAY SUBMIT PERMIT APPLICATIONS.\n(A) (1) Permit applications will be accepted only from the landowner, a lessee or person holding an option to purchase\nor contract to purchase the land or an authorized agent of the landowner.

It may not be\nnecessary that the application contain the type of detailed construction drawings that would be necessary to determine\ncompliance with these appendices, so long as the plans provide sufficient information to allow the permit-issuing authority to\nevaluate the application in the light of the substantive requirements set forth in this text. However, whenever the permit-\nissuing authority under this chapter requires a certain element of a development to be constructed in accordance with the\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "detail requirements set forth in one or more of these appendices, then no construction work on such element may be\ncommenced until detailed construction drawings shall have been submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator\nand/or the Chief Building Inspector or his or her designee. Failure to observe this requirement may result in permit\nrevocation, denial of final subdivision plat approval or other penalty as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 153.415 through 153.420.\n(D) The presumption established by this chapter is that all of the information set forth in this chapter is necessary to\nsatisfy the requirements of this section. However, it is recognized that each development is unique, and therefore the permit-\nissuing authority may allow less information or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of the\nparticular case. For applications submitted to the Board of Aldermen or Board of Adjustment, the applicant may rely in the\nfirst instance on the recommendations of the Zoning Administrator as to whether more or less information than that set forth\nin this chapter should be submitted.\n(E) The Zoning Administrator shall make every effort to develop application forms, instructional sheets, checklists or\nother techniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and the form and type of\ninformation that must be submitted. In classes of cases where a minimal amount of information is necessary to enable the\nZoning Administrator to determine compliance with this chapter, such as applications for zoning permits to construct single-\nfamily houses or duplexes, or applications for sign permits, the Zoning Administrator shall develop standard forms that will\nexpedite the submission of the necessary plans and other required information.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.343 STAFF CONSULTATION BEFORE FORMAL APPLICATION.\n(A) To minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and ensure compliance with\nthe requirements of this chapter, pre-application consultation between the developer and the planning staff is encouraged or\nrequired as provided in this section.\n(B) Before submitting an application for a special use permit authorizing a development that consists of or contains a\nmajor subdivision, the developer shall consult with the planning staff.\n(C) Before submitting an application for any other permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult with the\nplanning staff concerning the application of this chapter to the proposed development.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.344 STAFF CONSULTATION AFTER APPLICATION SUBMITTED.\n(A) Upon receipt of a formal application for a zoning, special use permit, or minor plat approval, the Zoning Administrator\nshall review the application and confer with the applicant to ensure that he or she understands the planning staff's\ninterpretation of the applicable provisions of this chapter, that he or she has submitted all of the information that he or she\nintends to submit, and that the application represents what he or she proposes to do.\n(B) If the application is for a special use permit, the Zoning Administrator shall place the application on the agenda of the\nappropriate board after the applicant indicates that the application is as complete as he or she intends to make it. If the\nZoning Administrator believes that the application is incomplete, he or she shall recommend to the appropriate board that\nthe application be denied on that basis.\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.345 ZONING PERMITS.\n(A) A complete application form for a zoning permit shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator by filing a copy of the\napplication with the Zoning Administrator in the Planning and Inspections Department.\n(B) The Zoning Administrator shall issue the zoning permit unless he or she finds, after reviewing the application, that:\n(1)\nThe requested permit is not within his or her jurisdiction according to the table of permissible uses;\n(2) The application is incomplete; or\n(3) If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this\nchapter (not including those requirements imposed when a variance has been granted or those the applicant is not required\nto comply with under the circumstances specified in \u00a7\u00a7 153.030 through 153.038).\n(Ord. passed 4-9-2013; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.346 AUTHORIZING USE OR OCCUPANCY BEFORE COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT UNDER ZONING\nPERMIT.\nIn cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the zoning permit recipient (exclusive\nof financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the zoning permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements\nof this chapter prior to commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the Zoning Administrator\nmay notify the Building Inspector that the applicant may be allowed to commence the intended use or the occupancy of\nbuildings (insofar as the requirements of this chapter are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a performance bond,\ncash funds, letter of credit, real estate of equal value or other security satisfactory to the Administrator to ensure that all of\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "the requirements of this chapter will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed 12 months).

Such deviation shall be documented in writing and submitted to the\nappropriate permit-issuing authority.\n(B) Minor design modifications or changes in permits (including approved plans) are permissible with the approval of the\npermit-issuing authority. Such permission may be obtained without a formal application, public hearing or payment of any\nadditional fee.

The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure allowing a landowner to apply for the right to develop\nland in accordance with a previously approved site-specific development (as defined herein).\n(B) Vested rights.\n(1) Amendments in land development regulations are not applicable or enforceable without the written consent of the\nowner with regard to any of the following:\n(a) Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application has been submitted and\nsubsequently issued in accordance with G.S. \u00a7 143-755.\n(b) Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application authorizing the subdivision has been submitted\nand subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. \u00a7 143-755.\n(c) A site-specific vesting plan.\n(d) A multi-phased development.\n(2) A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement authorized by G.S. Ch. 160D, Art. 10.\n(3) The establishment of a vested right under any subdivision of this section does not preclude vesting under one or\nmore other subdivisions of this Subsection or vesting by application of common law principles. A vested right, once\nestablished as provided for in this section or by common law, precludes any action by the town that would change, alter,\nimpair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the applicable land\ndevelopment regulation or regulations, except where a change in state or federal law mandating town enforcement occurs\nafter the development application is submitted that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on the development or use.\n(C) Duration of vesting.\n(1) Upon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting granted by this section for a development project is\neffective upon filing of the application in accordance with G.S. \u00a7 143-755, for so long as the permit remains valid pursuant to\nlaw. Unless otherwise specified by this section or other statute, local development permits expire one year after issuance\nunless work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced. For the purposes of this section, a permit is issued\neither in the ordinary course of business of the town or by the applicable governmental agency as a court directive.\n(2) Except where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or this chapter, the statutory vesting granted by this\nsection, once established, expires for an uncompleted development project if development work is intentionally and\nvoluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months, and the statutory vesting period granted by this\nsection for a nonconforming use of property expires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not\nless than 24 consecutive months. The 24-month discontinuance period is automatically tolled during the pendency of any\nPlanning and Adjustment Board proceeding or civil action in a state or federal trial or appellate court regarding the validity of\na development permit, the use of the property, or the existence of the statutory vesting period granted by this section. The\n24-month discontinuance period is also tolled during the pendency of any litigation involving the development project or\nproperty that is the subject of the vesting.\n(D) Multiple permits for development project. Subject to Section 1.10, where multiple town development permits are\nrequired to complete a development project, the development permit applicant may choose the version of each of the town\nland development regulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the application for the initial development permit.\nThis provision is applicable only for those subsequent development permit applications filed within 18 months of the date\nfollowing the approval of an initial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this section, an erosion and\nsedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial development permit.\n(E) Multi-phased development. A multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with the land\ndevelopment regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased\ndevelopment. A right which has been vested as provided for in this section remains vested for a period of seven years from\nthe time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "(F) Continuing review. Following issuance of a development permit, the town may make subsequent inspections and\nreviews to ensure compliance with the applicable land development regulations in effect at the time of the original\napplication.\n(G) Process to claim vested rights. A person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to\nsubstantiate that claim to the Zoning Administrator who shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the vested\nright. The decision of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Planning and Adjustment Board. On appeal, the\nexistence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination or pursuing an appeal, a\nperson claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by G.S. \u00a7 160D-1403.1.\n(H) Miscellaneous provisions. The vested rights granted by this section run with the land except for the use of land for\noutdoor advertising governed by G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 136-131.1 and 136-131.2 in which case the rights granted by this section run with\nthe owner of a permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. Nothing in this section precludes judicial\ndetermination, based on common law principles or other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or\nthat a compensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to alter the existing common law.\n(I) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or\nrequires a different meaning.\nDEVELOPMENT. As defined in G.S. \u00a7 143-755(e)(1).\nDEVELOPMENT PERMIT. As defined in G.S. \u00a7 143-755(e)(2).\nLAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATION.

The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice of the determination\nwithin which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of\nactual or constructive notice of the determination within which to file an appeal. The written notice of appeal shall specify the\ngrounds for the appeal, a statement of the decision or interpretation alleged to be improper, the date of that decision or\ninterpretation, and all supporting materials related to the decision. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given\npursuant to this chapter by first-class mail shall be deemed received on the third business day following deposit of the notice\nfor mailing with the United States Postal Service.\n(4) Record of decision. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all documents and\nexhibits constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the\nrecord to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.\n(5) Stays. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from\nand accrual of any fines assessed unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board after notice of appeal has\nbeen filed that, because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or, because\nthe violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the development regulation. In that\ncase, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If\nenforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the\nappeal, and the board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, appeals of decisions granting a development approval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is\nconsistent with the development regulation shall not stay the further review of an application for development approvals to\nuse such property; in these situations, the appellant or town may request and the board may grant a stay of a final decision\n"}, {"page": "98", "text": "of development approval applications, including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.\n(C) Appeal of decision.

It shall not be necessary to\ndemonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property; and\n(2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography.\nHardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the\nneighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
