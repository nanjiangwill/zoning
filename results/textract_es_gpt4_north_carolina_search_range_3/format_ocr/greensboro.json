This \"Zoning\" geographic coverage layer constitutes the City of Greensboro's official zoning map, and is\nas much a part of this ordinance as if actually depicted within the pages of this ordinance. The Planning Director must\ndirect revisions to the official zoning map to reflect its amendment as soon as possible after the effective date of zoning\nmap amendments. No unauthorized person may alter or modify the official zoning map. The Planning Director may\nauthorize printed copies of the official zoning map to be produced, and must maintain digital or printed copies of\nsuperseded versions of the official zoning map for historical reference.\n30-1-10.1 District Boundaries\nWhere the ordinance establishing a zoning boundary identifies the boundary as following a particular feature, or reflects\na clear intent that the boundary follows the feature, the boundary will be construed as following that feature as it actually\nexists.\n30-1-10.2 Boundary Interpretations\nA. Where any uncertainty exists about a zoning boundary, the Planning Director is authorized to interpret the boundary's\nlocation using the following rules of interpretation:\n1. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a lot line or parcel boundary is construed as\nfollowing the lot line or parcel boundary as it actually existed at the time the zoning boundary was established.\n2. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a river, stream, lake or other watercourse is\nconstrued as following the actual centerline of the watercourse.\n3. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a street or alley is generally construed as\nfollowing the right-of-way line of the street or alley.\n4. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following a railroad line is construed as following the\ncenterline of the railroad.\n5. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately following the boundary of a municipality or of its\nextraterritorial jurisdiction is construed as following that boundary.\n6. A boundary shown on the zoning map as approximately parallel to, or as an apparent extension of, a feature\ndescribed above is construed as being actually parallel to, or an extension of, the feature.\n7. Outer boundaries of General Watershed Area overlay districts indicated as approximately following ridgelines or\nstreets are construed to follow ridgelines (the actual drainage basin boundaries) or street right-of-way or\ncenterlines. Watershed Critical Area district outer boundaries not abutting General Watershed Area overlay\ndistricts are construed in the same manner. Boundaries between General Watershed Area overlay districts and\nWatershed Critical Area overlay districts indicated as approximately following major landmarks (identifiable major\nfeatures) such as streets are construed to follow the right-of-way or centerlines of such features or, where\napplicable, the projections of the right-of-way or centerlines of such features.\n8. Past zoning maps may be consulted to aid in interpreting boundary lines.\nB.\nAppeals of administrative interpretations of zoning boundaries may be taken to the Board of Adjustment in\naccordance with 30-4-27.\n30-1-11 Annexation\nIf any portion of the territory subject to county jurisdiction is annexed by the city or taken into the city's extraterritorial\njurisdiction by act of the General Assembly or in accordance with NCGS Article 4A of Chapter 160A or NCGS Article 2 of\nChapter 160D, county regulations and powers of enforcement remain in effect until:\n30-1-11.1 the city has adopted regulations for the annexed or extraterritorial area; or\n31 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\n30-1-11.2\na period of 60 days has elapsed following the effective date of annexation or extension of\nextraterritorial jurisdiction.\n(Amended by Ord. 21-127 on 8/17/21)\n30-1-12 Transitional Provisions\n30-1-12.1 Effect on Valid Building Permits and Vested Rights\nUnless the subject owner voluntarily agrees to comply with this ordinance the owner is entitled to complete development\nof buildings or uses pursuant to approved development plans, for which either:\nA. building permits have been issued pursuant to NCGS 160D-403 prior to July 1, 2010, so long as the permits remain\nvalid and unexpired pursuant to NCGS 160D-403(c) and unrevoked pursuant to NCGS 160D-403(f); or\nB. a vested right has been established pursuant to NCGS 160D-108.1 and such vested right remains valid and unexpired\npursuant to NCGS 160D-108.1.\n(Amended by Ord. 21-127 on 8/17/21)\nEffective on: 8/17/2021\n30-1-12.2 Other Approval Granted before Effective Date\nVariances, special use permits, subdivision plats, site plans, and other similar development approvals that are valid on\nJune 30, 2010, will remain valid until their expiration date.

These are referred to as\n\"nonconformities,\" which should not be confused with \"illegal\" uses or structures.\n30-2-1.1 Scope\nThe regulations of this article govern lots, uses, buildings, signs and other aspects of development that came into\nexistence lawfully but do not conform to one or more requirements of this ordinance. These are referred to as\n\"nonconformities,\" which should not be confused with \"illegal\" uses or structures.\n30-2-1.2 Intent\nThe regulations of this article are intended to:\nA. recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use their property for lawful purposes;\nB. promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings; and\nC. place reasonable limits on the expansion and alteration of nonconformities that have the potential to adversely affect\nsurrounding properties or the community as a whole.\n30-2-1.3 Determination of Nonconforming Status\nA. If the Planning Director cannot determine a property's nonconforming status, then the burden of proving that a\nsituation is nonconforming (as opposed to illegal) rests with the subject landowner.\nB. In situations where a copy of the approved plan for a project cannot be located, the landowner may provide\nreasonable evidence of the existing improvements. Such evidence may be offered by any reasonable means including\nbut not limited to an affidavit signed by the owner or other party. After submission of evidence of the existing\nimprovements, the Planning Director shall reasonably determine their status using the ordinances in effect at the time\nof the installation of the improvements.\n30-2-1.4 Determination of Value\nThe value of property shall be presumed to be the property's tax value unless rebutted by competent evidence presented\nby the owner to the Planning Director.

Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of nonconformities are permitted unless the repairs are otherwise\nexpressly prohibited by this ordinance. For the purpose of this provision, repair or replacement of non-load bearing\nwalls, fixtures, electrical or plumbing are considered incidental repairs if the total value of the repairs in any 12-month\nperiod does not exceed 50% of the tax value of the structure.\nB. Nothing in this article is to be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a\nsafe condition, in accordance with an official order of the Building Inspector or other duly authorized city official.\nWhen improvements are made to restore property to a safe condition, the cost of those repairs or alterations are\nincluded in the 50% limit noted in the preceding paragraph.\n30-2-1.6 Change of Tenancy or Ownership\nNonconforming status \"runs with the land\" and is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management.\n30-2-2 Nonconforming Lot of Record\n30-2-2.1 Nonconforming Lots Resulting from Public Acquisition\nLots of record that are rendered nonconforming or more nonconforming as a result of acquisition of a portion of the lot\nfor public purposes by any public agency have the status of nonconforming lots of record.\n30-2-2.2 Use of Nonconforming Lots\nNonconforming lots of record may be used in accordance with this ordinance.\nA. Lots with Contiguous Frontage in One Ownership\nWhere 2 or more lots of record with contiguous frontage are under common ownership, and one or more is a\nnonconforming lot, the lots shall be deemed merged into a single zone lot to the extent necessary to create one or\nmore lots that comply with or come as close as possible to complying with the lot requirements of the underlying\nzoning district. This provision does not apply to contiguous nonconforming lots of record that are at least 40 feet in\nwidth and have not, at any time since July 1, 1992, provided required setbacks, parking, or landscaping for a use\nsituated on an adjacent lot. These may be considered \"Single Lots of Record\" under subsection (B) below.\nB. Single Lot of Record\n1. A nonconforming lot of record may be built upon if compliance is achieved with regard to all ordinance\nrequirements except for lot area or width.\n2.

A nonconforming use may not be relocated, in whole or in part, to another portion of the subject lot or parcel.\nC. A nonconforming use may not be expanded, enlarged, or extended to occupy a greater area of land or floor area.\nD. Appeal\nExpansion or alteration decisions may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with 30-4-27.\n30-2-3.3 Damage or Destruction\nA nonconforming use that is damaged by fire, neglect, or natural causes may retain nonconforming status if the damage\nto the structure does not exceed 50% of its pre-damage tax value, according to bona fide repair estimates provided by the\nsubject property owner.\n30-2-3.4 Change of Use\nA. Change to a Conforming Use\nThe Planning Director may allow a nonconforming use to be changed to any use allowed in the subject zoning district\nprovided compliance with all applicable ordinance requirements is achieved.

A Transportation Impact Study is required when the subject development is expected to generate 150 additional\ntrips during the adjacent street AM or PM peak hour or 1,500 additional daily trips, subject to the exemptions set\nout in 30-4-5.4(B).\n5. When sufficient information on the proposed development is available for GDOT to determine that the\naforementioned criteria is met, a Transportation Impact Study must be submitted with all preliminary plats, site\nplans, site plan revisions, Special Use Permit applications, conditional rezoning applications, and conditional\noriginal zoning applications where the proposed city zoning entails greater trip generation than does the existing\ncounty zoning.\n6. Trip rates must be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip Generation published by\nthe Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or any local trip generation rates either published or approved by\nGDOT. Additional trips must be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the existing use from the\ngross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation applies to property that is occupied at the\ntime of submittal or has been occupied at any time prior to submittal.\n7. If a development or property has experienced a change in zoning classification after July 1, 1999 and special\ncircumstances exist, GDOT may require a Transportation Impact Study without regard to the expected trip\ngeneration of the development. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:\na. there are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development. (\"Level of Service\" as\ndefined in the Highway Capacity Manual-Transportation Research Board Special Report 209); or\nb. available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.\nB. Exemptions\nNotwithstanding the applicability thresholds above, a Transportation Impact Study is not required if the property\nto be rezoned or developed has been the subject of a Transportation Impact Study within the previous 3 years and\nthe projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or less than the previous study\nperformed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed.\nC. Study Preparation\n1. A licensed professional engineer who has completed the GDOT self-certification form must attend a presubmittal\nconference with GDOT and prepare the Transportation Impact Study. The draft Transportation Impact Study must\nbe submitted to GDOT at least 21 days before filing the zoning map amendment application.\n2. The Transportation Impact Study must follow the guidelines prepared by GDOT. The Transportation Impact Study\nmust address:\na. the proposed land use,\nb. the trip generation of the proposed use,\nC. site access,\nd. modal splits, if appropriate,\ne. impacts on the multimodal transportation system from the proposed development, and\nf. physical improvements or enforceable management strategies to mitigate negative impacts.\n3. At a minimum, the Transportation Impact Study must identify the improvements necessary to maintain Level of\nService \"D\" for streets and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation Research\nBoard Special Report 209. GDOT will provide current traffic count information for use in Transportation Impact\nStudies if such counts are available.\n4.

Merely proving that the modification would permit a greater\nprofit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the granting of a modification.\nMoreover, the decision-making body must consider whether the modification is the minimum possible\ndeviation from the terms of the ordinance that will make possible the reasonable use of the subject property;\nb. the hardship results from the application of the ordinance to the property rather than from other factors such\nas deed restrictions or other hardship;\nC. the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size, shape, or topography,\nwhich is different from that of neighboring property;\nd. the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the\nordinance, or who purchases the property and then applies for relief; and\ne. the hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions that are widespread. If\nother properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a modification\nwould be a special privilege denied to others, and would not promote equal justice.\n2. the modification is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance and preserves its spirit; and\n3. in the granting of the modification, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has\nbeen done.

In approving a Site Specific Development Plan, the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council may impose\nadditional terms and conditions as deemed reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\nC. Site Specific Development Plans requiring a variance prior to final approval may not receive zoning vested right status\nuntil the necessary variance has been obtained.\nD. The establishment of a zoning vested right does not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional\nrequirements that do not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or other ordinances or regulations that are\ngeneral in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the city. These may include, but\nare not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. All otherwise applicable new or amended\nregulations become effective with respect to property that is subject to a Site Specific Development Plan upon the\nexpiration or termination of the zoning vested right in accordance with this section.\nE. A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but attaches to and runs with the applicable property. After approval of a\nSite Specific Development Plan, all successors to the original landowner are entitled to exercise such right as long as\nthe zoning vested right remains valid.\nF. A zoning vested right only protects the landowner from zoning amendments that affect the allowable type or intensity\nof use of property. However, it does not protect the landowner from zoning amendments that do not affect the\nallowable type or intensity of use of property or from nonzoning amendments to this ordinance.\n(Amended by Ord. 20-099 on 9/1/20)\nEffective on: 6/15/2021\n30-4-25.3 Approval Procedure\nA.

District Standards\n30-7-1 Measurements and Computation\n30-7-1.1 Development\nA. Development Area\nThe minimum development area is the total area of contiguous land and water bodies under single ownership or\nunder multiple ownership proposed for development as a single unit or recorded as a single unit. A development does\nnot need to be developed all at once to satisfy the development area requirement.\nB. Development Width\nThe minimum development width is the distance from one side of a tract to the opposing side of a tract measured at\nedge of the right of way.\n30-7-1.2 Separation Distances\nA. Property\nProperty separation is measured as the horizontal distance between property lines, measured along the shortest line\nthat can be drawn between the subject property lines.\nB. Property (along the street)\nProperty separation along the street is measured as the horizontal distance between property lines, measured along\nthe shortest route that follows the centerline of the street right-of-way between the nearest property lines of the\nsubject properties.\nC. Use\nUse separation is measured as the horizontal distance between buildings occupied by the subject use, measured along\nthe shortest line that can be drawn between the exterior walls.\nD. Establishment\nEstablishment separation is measured as the horizontal distance between the outer limits of the floor space occupied\nby the subject use and the lot occupied by the \"protected\" use or the referenced zoning district boundary, measured\nalong the shortest line that can be drawn between the subject areas.\nCommentary: \"establishment\" separation is intended to address uses that occupy floor space in a\nmulti-tenant building, in which case a common (interior) wall may sometimes represent the\nappropriate point of measurement.\nE.

Lot Area\nThe lot area is the total area circumscribed by the boundaries of a lot, excluding street right-of-way, except that, for\npurposes of computing lot area to satisfy minimum lot area requirements, the following rules apply:\n1. If intersecting street rights-of-way at a corner lot are connected by a right-of-way chord or radius, the area lying\nbetween the chord or radius and the projections of the 2 street right-of-way lines to a point of intersection are\nincluded in the lot area calculation.\n2. If a street right-of-way line cannot be determined, or if the street is a private street, a line parallel to and 25 feet\nfrom the center of the traveled portion of the street will be used as the boundary for lot area calculation.\n3. For lots abutting collector or local street rights-of-way wider than required by this ordinance, the extra right-of-way\non each side will be counted toward the minimum lot area of the abutting lot on the same side.\n4. For additional lot area standards applying to multi-family development, see 30-8-10.1(H).\nB. Lot Width\nThe lot width is the distance from side lot line to side lot line measured at the minimum front street setback (parallel\nto the front property line). For lots along circular turnarounds, the lot width may be measured at a front street setback\nof up to 50 feet from the street right-of-way. On circular turnarounds, the point where lot width is measured is\nconsidered the minimum building line.\nFigure 7-2, Minimum Lot Width/Determination of Minimum Building Line\n145 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "146", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nMinimum Lot Width\nDetermination of Minimum Building Line\nMinimum Setback from\nCL Where Required\nMinimum Lot Width &\nMinimum Building Line\nMin.

Street Setbacks\nStreet setbacks are computed by the horizontal distance from the existing or proposed (whichever is further from the\ncenterline) street right-of-way line to the nearest part of the applicable building, structure, sign, or activity, measured\nperpendicularly to the line. The future street right-of-way line will be determined by the Street Design Standards\nManual using the street centerline or other appropriate reference point which satisfies the intent of the street design\nstandards and its roadway classification. Determination of any future street right of way line shall only apply to those\nstreets that have been identified on the Thoroughfare Plan or Collector Street Plan as requiring improvements or\nwidening.\n1.

Application Requirements\nIn addition to any other application requirements, applicants subject to the average (mean) setback must\nsubmit detailed plans showing building footprints for existing buildings in the area. These plans must be\nannotated with building setbacks, and other information that the Planning Director may require to\ndetermine compliance with these requirements.\n2. Side\nSide street setback is a required street setback that is not a front street setback.\n3. Thoroughfare\nThoroughfare (major or minor) setback is the setback required for any portion of a lot abutting a thoroughfare\nright of way line.\n4. Street Setback Reduction\na. Nonresidential Uses and Multifamily Dwellings\nWhere 50% or more of the lots on the same block face as the subject lot are occupied by buildings containing\nnonresidential uses or multifamily dwellings with less than the minimum street setback requirement of the\nsubject zoning district, buildings on the subject lot may comply with the minimum street setback requirement\nof the district or the average setback requirement calculated in accordance with 30-7-1.4(A)1)b).\nB.

Purpose\nThese standards are intended to encourage reinvestment in existing neighborhoods that complements the\nneighborhood's established character.\nB. Description\nThe contextual infill development option may be used at the subject property owner's election to guide construction\nin already built up areas to ensure that new development or redevelopment complements the established character\nof the neighborhood. When these contextual infill development standards are in conflict with the dimensional\nstandards of the base zoning district, these contextual standards govern.\nFigure 7-14, Contextual Infill Development\nContextual Infill Development\nExample 'A'\n8 Lots Total /5 Lots Existing Residential = >50%\nInfill\nInfill\nInfill\nSite\nSite\nSite\nExample \"B\"\n16 Lots Total /13 Lots Existing Residential = >75%\nInfill\nInfill\nSite\nSite\nInfill\nSite\nThe Contextual Infill Development Standards May be Used on any Project in a Residential Single\nFamily Zoning District that is Less Than Two Acres and is Either:\nExample A: Located on a Block Where More Than 50% of the Lots on the Same Block Face\n(Located On the Same Side of a Street) are Occupied by an Existing Single Family\nDevelopment or\nExample B: 75% of the Lots on the Subject Block Face and the Opposing Block Face are\nOccupied by an Existing Single Family Development or\nSurrounded on all sides by Existing Single Family Development.\nC. Applicability\nThe contextual infill development standards may be used in the following situations:\n1. R- Residential Single-family Districts\nIn single-family residential zoning districts, contextual infill development standards may be used on any project\nthat is less than 2 acres in area and is located on a block where more than 50% of the lots on the same block face\n168 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "169", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\n(all the lots on the same side of a street) or 75% of the lots on the subject block face and the opposing block face\n(the other side of the street) are occupied by existing single-family dwellings.\n2. RM- Residential Multi-family Districts\nIn multi-family residential zoning districts, contextual infill development standards may be used on any site that is\nless than 2 acres in area.\n3. Date of Establishment of Lots\nThe lots to be built upon in accordance with these contextual infill development standards must have been lawfully\nestablished before January 1, 1960.\n4. Nonresidential Development\nThe contextual infill development standards may not be used for nonresidential development.\nD. Lot Area\n1. For single-family projects (single-family detached, traditional, and zero lot line), there is no minimum lot area\nunder the contextual infill development option, provided all other standards are met.\n2. For all other residential projects, the minimum lot area for the respective zoning district applies.\nE. Lot Width\n1. For single-family projects, the minimum lot width requirement under the contextual infill development option is\nthe smaller of:\na. The average width of the adjacent lots fronting on the same block face; or\nb. The median of the widths for all other lots fronting on the same block face.\n2. For all other projects, the minimum lot width requirement for the respective zoning district applies.\nF. Setbacks\n1. Street Setback\na. Nonresidential Uses and Multifamily Dwellings\nMinimum setback requirements may be established in accordance with 30-7-1.4(A)4)a).\nb. Single Family Detached Dwellings\nMinimum setback requirements shall be established in accordance with 30-7-1.4(A)1)b).\n2. Side Setbacks\na. In R districts, the minimum contextual setback is equal to the side setback that exists on the abutting lot,\nprovided that no side setback may be less than 5 feet, and no setback is required to exceed 25% of the subject\nlot width.\nb. In RM districts, the side setbacks of the underlying zoning district apply.\nG. Buildings\n1. Building Coverage\nBuilding coverage requirements shall be the same as apply to the subject zoning district. In cases where the\nbuilding coverage on abutting lots is higher than the building coverage standard for the district, the\nPlanning Director may approve a Type 1 Modification (see 30-4-11) allowing an increase in building coverage of up\nto the average building coverage of the lots on either side of the subject lot. The applicant must submit\ndocumentation of the building coverage in a form approved by the Planning Director.\n2. Main Entrance\nEvery principal structure using the contextual infill development option must have a main entrance that fronts on a\npublic street.\n3. Parking, Garages, and Access\na. Contextual infill developments resulting in 4 or more dwelling units on a parcel must locate on-site parking to\nthe side or rear of the principal structure.\nb. Parking areas are prohibited in the front or side street setback when the contextual infill development\nstandards are used.\nC. Where access from an alley is available, access to garages and other off-street parking areas must be taken\n169 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "170", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nfrom that alley.\nd. When provided, attached and detached garages must be located behind the front building line. Garages may be\npositioned as follows:\nH. Additional Standards\nIf the contextual infill development is in an overlay district, additional standards may apply.\nI. Application Requirements\nIn addition to any other application requirements, applicants using the contextual infill option must submit detailed\nplans showing building footprints for existing buildings in the context area.

Up to 50% of the residential component requirement may be satisfied by existing residential units located within 1/4\nmile (convenient, safe walking distance) of the proposed building. Off-site dwelling units are calculated at a rate of\n1,500 square feet per dwelling unit. To be included in the calculation, the following conditions must be met:\na. Clearly defined pedestrian connections must be provided between the residential units and the proposed\ndevelopment; and\nb. Overnight accommodations may not be considered residential units.\nC. The residential component may not exceed 70% of the gross floor area;\n4. The preceding residential component limitation does not apply to vertical mixed-use buildings that are at least 4\nstories in height if the street frontage of the first floor is entirely occupied by eating and drinking establishments,\npersonal and professional services or retail sales and service uses.

Buildings within a block face must reflect a continuity of building scale at the building line.\nb. A consistent building line should be maintained at the setback line along the street. However, projections of\nporches, bay windows, stoops, and other minor building masses into the street setback are encouraged in order\nto create an interesting block character. Large street setbacks to accommodate parking lots in front of a building\nare prohibited.\nC. In areas of mixed residential types, the height and massing of a building may not be more than twice the height\nand massing of structures adjacent to or across the street from the building.\nd. A commercial or mixed-use building must integrate its appearance with the area and may not exceed twice the\nheight and massing of adjacent buildings\n2. Human Scale Design\nHuman scale design typically reflects the elements listed below.\na. Buildings that avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes. Blank, windowless walls are\ngenerally not allowed along street frontages. Where solid walls are required by building codes, the wall should\nbe articulated by the provision of blank window openings trimmed with frames, sills, lintels, or if the building is\noccupied by a commercial use, by using recessed or projecting display window cases;\nb. Commercial structures that incorporate awnings or arcades, which may project over the sidewalk into the\nstreet right-of-way with city approval;\nC. Ground floor retail, service, restaurant, and other commercial uses with transparent display windows on a\nminimum of 50% of the first floor front to provide views into the interior of buildings;\n187 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "188", "text": "Firefox\nhtp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nd. Entrances and storefronts facing the street;\ne. Doors, windows, balconies, porches, and roof decks with visibility of the street and other public spaces to\nencourage social interaction;\nf. Porches generally as a significant element of the house design, located on the front or side of the dwelling; and\ng. Rear vehicle access from an alley as a preference. However, if a garage is oriented toward the street, it must be\nlocated a minimum of 20 feet behind the front fa\u00e7ade of the principal structure. Freestanding garages and\ncarport structures for multiple dwelling unit buildings must be designed to be integral with the building design\nor sited so as to avoid long and monotonous rows of garage doors and long monotonous building walls.\n3. Guidelines for the Provision of Traditional Neighborhood Open Space\na. Traditional neighborhood open space should be incorporated as a fundamental element of the Plan.\nb. Open spaces should emphasize safe and inviting traditional neighborhood areas such as squares, parks, and\ngreenways. Such areas should be integrated into the neighborhood pattern for the active and passive\nenjoyment of neighborhood residents.\nC. Traditional neighborhood open space should be planned and improved to be highly accessible and usable by\npersons living or working nearby. Except for areas designated as preserves, it should be cleared of underbrush\nand debris and may contain one or more of the following or similar improvements: landscaping, walks,\nbenches, seating areas, fountains, ponds, ball fields and playground equipment. Significant stands of trees,\nstreamside areas, and other valuable topographic features should be preserved within the open space areas.\nH. Street Trees\nStreet Trees are required along both sides of a street in the TN Traditional Neighborhood District in accordance with\nthe approved locations shown in the adopted Traditional Neighborhood Development Plan for the district.\n(Amended by Ord. 13-101 on 7/16/13)\nResources\nTraditional Neighborhood Overlay Districts\nMartin Luther King Jr. Drive North\nSouthside\nWillow Oaks\n30-7-8 Overlay Zoning Districts\nCommentary: This section contains the general standards of the various overlay districts.

Manufactured dwellings which do not comply with the provisions of this subsection on the effective date of this\nordinance shall be removed within 12 months of the effective date of the ordinance.\nE. Uses deemed likely to have adverse impacts on water quality are prohibited within the WCA district. Such prohibited\nuses are identified (by a parenthetical note) in the use category descriptions. See also the WCA provisions of 30-12-4.\n30-8-3 Use Categories Generally\n30-8-3.1 Approach to Categorizing Uses\nA. The use categories found in the use table in 30-8-1, Permitted Use Table, are set forth in this section. Specific uses may\nbe further defined in Article 15.\nB. Any use not specifically listed in the use category in this section is prohibited, unless the Planning Director determines\nthat the use is similar to a permitted use in that district. Where any similar permitted use is subject to additional use\nstandards or special use permit approval, the proposed use is also subject to those standards or approval.\n30-8-3.2 Basis for Classifications\nUse categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics.\nCharacteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold\nor delivered, likely impact on surrounding properties, and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis\nfor assigning land uses to appropriate zoning districts.\n30-8-3.3 Uses Not Specifically Listed\nWhen a specific use type cannot be readily classified into a use category or appears to fit into 2 or more use categories,\nthe Planning Director is authorized to determine the most similar, thus most appropriate, use category based on the\nfollowing considerations:\nA. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category;\nB. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;\nC. Relative amounts of sales from each activity;\nD. The customer type for each activity;\n213 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "214", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nE. The relative number of employees in each activity;\nF. Hours of operation;\nG. Building and site arrangement;\nH. Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements;\nI. The relative number of vehicle trips generated;\nJ. Signs;\nK. How the use is advertised;\nL. The anticipated impact on surrounding properties; and\nM. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.\n30-8-3.4 Developments with Multiple Principal Uses\nDevelopments with multiple principal uses must conform to the following:\nA. When all principal uses of a development fall within one Use Category, the entire development is assigned to that Use\nCategory;\nB. When the principal uses of a development fall within different Use Categories, each principal use must be classified in\nthe applicable Use Category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that Use Category; and\nC. A development comprised of uses regulated by separate rows on the Use Table must be reviewed using the most\nrestrictive process from among the proposed uses.\nCommentary: For example, if a development includes a convenience store, fuel sales and a restaurant, and one of\nthose uses is only permitted by special use permit in the district, then the entire development requires a special\nuse permit.\n30-8-3.5 Typical Uses\nThe \"Typical Use Types\" portion of each use category lists principal uses common to that use category. The names of\nthese sample uses are generic and are based on common meanings, not on what a specific use may call itself. Many\naccessory uses that are often found with such principal uses are not shown on these lists.\nCommentary: For example, a use that calls itself \"Wholesale Warehouse,\" but sells mostly to retail consumers, is\nincluded in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Trade category.\n30-8-3.6 Excluded Use Types\nThe \"Excluded Uses Types\" portion of each use category lists uses that may appear to be part of a particular category, but\nthat are expressly included in a different use category.\n30-8-4 Agricultural Use Group\n30-8-4.1 Agriculture\nA.

New Buildings or Uses\nPrincipal buildings or open uses of land constructed, reconstructed, or established after June 30, 1992.\nB. Changes in Use\nChanges in use that result in an increase of 2 or more in the Land Use Classification number, in which case the\nlandscaping requirements of this article apply to the entire zone lot.\nC. Expansions\nThe requirements of this article apply only to the expansion of buildings, parking areas, or open uses of land.\n30-10-1.3 Exemptions\nThe following uses and activities are exempt from the requirements of this article. This exemption does not constitute an\nexemption from the Water Supply Watershed District requirements of 30-12-3, the Watershed Critical Area requirements\nof 30-12-4, the General Watershed Area requirements of 30-12-5 or the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control\nrequirements of 30-12-6.\nA. lots occupied or to be occupied by single-family detached dwellings or two-family dwellings;\nB. property lines abutting utility easements in excess of 60 feet in width and all railroad rights-of-way; and\nC. property lines abutting dedicated street right-of-way that has remained unopened for a period of at least 15 years.\nCommentary: For the purposes of this section the housing types \"Traditional House\" and \"Zero Lot Line\" are\nconsidered single-family detached dwellings, the housing types \"Twin Home\" and \"Duplex\" are considered two-\nfamily dwellings, and the housing type \"Townhouse\" is considered a multi-family development.\n30-10-1.4 Other Landscaping Standards\nMore specific landscaping standards are established for some zoning districts, such as the CB, CN, TN, MU-M, MU-H and\nsome overlay districts. See 30-10-3. For the TN district see 30-4-7.5.\n30-10-2 Multi-family and Nonresidential Landscaping Requirements\n30-10-2.1 Applicability\nA. Multi-family, nonresidential and mixed-use development is subject to standards of this section, which generally\nrequires street planting yards abutting public rights-of-way (See 30-10-2.2), buffer planting yards between different\nland use classifications (See 30-10-2.3) and parking lot landscaping (See 30-10-2.6).\nB. The standards of this section do not apply to multi-family, nonresidential or mixed-use development in MU-M, MU-H,\nTN, CN or CB districts. Development in those districts is subject to the urban landscaping requirements of 30-10-3.\nC. For the CB zoning district, see the Downtown Greensboro Design Manual for applicable guidelines.\n30-10-2.2 Street Planting Yards\nA. Street planting yards must be installed abutting public street rights-of-way.\nB.

They are intended to mitigate potential adverse impacts that may result when higher intensity land uses are\nlocated adjacent to lower intensity land uses.\nA. Type of Buffer Planting Yard Required\n1. To determine the type of buffer planting yard required, first identify the class of the proposed (new, changed, or\nexpanded) use and then identify the class of each existing use on adjacent sites (See Table 10-2). Then using Table\n10-1, the intersection of the row associated with the proposed use and the column associated with the adjacent\nuse shows the type of planting yard required. Staff will determine the location of planting to provide for the\nmaximum visual buffer effect.\nCommentary: For sites abutting vacant property see also buffer requirements\nin Section 30-10-2.6(B).\n2. A land use is considered to \"exist\" on an adjacent property when a building permit is issued.\n3.\nIf a zone lot contains uses with different land use classifications, the higher numbered land use classification\napplies unless the Technical Review Committee grants a Type 2 Modification in accordance with 30-4-11.\n4.

Required Landscaping\n1. Parking lot planting yards must include at least one canopy tree for every 12 parking spaces.\n2. Required canopy tree areas must be located within the parking lot. They may be located in landscape islands,\nlandscape divider medians between rows of parking, or in driveway medians.\n3. Islands or other planting areas for canopy trees must have a minimum area of 200 square feet with a minimum\ndimension of 7 feet, measured in any direction. Islands or planting areas of less than 200 square feet may not be\ncounted toward satisfying parking lot landscaping requirements.\n4. The landowner may provide required landscape islands or planting areas using one or more of the planting area\nsizes below. Each parking space must be entirely within the designated distance of a parking lot planting area as\nspecified below:\n(1) Canopy trees installed as part of a required planting yard that abuts the parking lot may be used for up to 50% of the required distance\n5. Grouping canopy trees within the same landscape island or planting area is strongly encouraged, even if this would\ndecrease the number of islands within the parking lot.\nB. When a parking lot or other vehicular use area abuts a vacant site or a site with the same land use classification as the\nsubject site, a planting yard with a minimum width of 5 feet must be provided between the parking lot/vehicular use\narea and the abutting (interior) property line.

Off-Street Parking and Loading\n30-11-1 Scope and Purpose\nThe regulations of this article are intended to ensure provision of off-street parking and loading facilities in rough\nproportion to the typical parking and loading demands of different land uses. By requiring such facilities, it is the intent of\nthis article to help avoid the negative impacts associated with excessive spillover parking (into adjacent neighborhoods),\nwhile at the same time avoiding the negative environmental and urban design impacts that can result from an over-\nsupply of parking spaces and other vehicular use areas.\n30-11-2 Applicability\n30-11-2.1 New Development\nUnless otherwise expressly stated, the parking and loading standards of this article apply to all new buildings constructed\nand all new uses established in all zoning districts.\n30-11-2.2 Enlargements and Expansions\nA. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the parking and loading standards of this article apply whenever an existing\nbuilding or use is enlarged or expanded to include additional dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, or other units\nof measurement used for establishing off-street parking and loading requirements.\nB. In the case of enlargements or expansions triggering requirements for additional parking or loading, additional off-\nstreet parking and loading spaces are required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or\nuse. In other words, there is no requirement to address lawfully existing parking or loading deficits.\n30-11-2.3 Change of Use or Occupancy\nUnless otherwise expressly stated, when the nonresidential use or nonresidential occupancy of property changes,\nadditional off-street parking and loading facilities must be provided to serve the new use or occupancy only when the\nnumber of parking or loading spaces required for the new use or occupancy exceeds the number of spaces required for\nthe use that most recently occupied the building, based on the standards of this development ordinance. In other words,\n\"credit\" is given to the most recent lawful use of the property for the number of parking spaces that would be required\nunder this development ordinance, regardless of whether such spaces are actually provided. A new nonresidential use is\nnot required to address a lawful, existing parking deficit. The provisions of this section do not apply to residential uses or\noccupancies. If a residential use is established in a building formerly used for nonresidential purposes, required parking\nspaces must be provided for the residential use.\n30-11-3 Compliance Required\nExisting parking and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum ratios established in this article or increased\nabove any maximum parking ratios established in this article.\n30-11-4 Exemptions and Reductions\n30-11-4.1 Exemption for CB District\nNo off-street parking is required for properties in the CB district.\n30-11-4.2 Historic Sites, Landmarks and Districts\n294 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "295", "text": "Firefox\nhtp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nNo off-street parking is required for:\nA. rehabilitation or reuse of a National Register site or locally designated landmark;\nB. rehabilitation or reuse of a contributing building within a National Register district or local historic district overlay;\nC. rehabilitation or reuse of a structure included in the city's inventory of historic architecture or a structure that is at\nleast 50 years old and is of equal architectural or historical significance to structures included in the city's inventory as\ndetermined by the Greensboro Historic Preservation Commission.\n30-11-4.3 Reduction for TN District\nThe minimum parking ratios of 30-11-5 are reduced by 25% for uses in the TN district.\n30-11-4.4 Exemption/Reduction for Small Lots\nNonresidential uses on lawfully established lots with less than 60 feet of frontage are not required to provide parking\nunless such use exceeds 3,000 square feet of gross floor area, in which case parking must be provided for the floor area in\nexcess of 3,000 square feet.

Comparability will be determined by\ndensity, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. Parking studies must document the source of all data used\nto develop recommended requirements.\n3. The applicant must establish a \"reserve area\" which is clearly designated on all plans and of a size and shape\nsufficient to provide the number of parking spaces equal to the credit granted.\n4. Upon a determination by the Planning Director that additional parking is needed, it must be installed within 30\ndays or be subject to the enforcement procedures of Article 5.\nCommentary: Demonstrated parking refers to a situation in which a proposed use is required to demonstrate\nthat it has the capacity to meet the minimum parking requirement, but does not necessarily need to actually\nconstruct all of the required amount if it only needs a portion of its demonstrated capacity (the un-built capacity\nwould be land banked on the site as a reserve for future parking if needed.) Then if a situation arises where the\noriginal use is replaced by a new use, the site will have the capacity to provide additional parking, if necessary,\nwhich would be built on the land banked reserve area.\nD. The minimum parking ratios of 30-11-5 are altered, as indicated on the table below, for the residential portions of\nmixed use developments in AO, NS, and UMU districts.\n(Amended by Ord. 13-147 on 11/19/13, Ord. 14-13 on 1/21/14, and Ord. 18-23 on 3/20/18)\n30-11-4.10 Reductions for C-M, C-H and BP Districts\nThe minimum parking ratios of 30-11-5 are reduced by 25% for all mixed-use context developments meeting the\nstandards of Section 30-8-10.1 (H) 1) c) ii) in the C-M, C-H and BP districts. No further parking reductions in these districts\nmay be approved in accordance with 30-11-13.\n(Amended by Ord. 16-019 on 2/16/16)\n30-11-5 Parking Ratios\nExcept as otherwise expressly stated, off-street parking space for motor vehicles must be provided in accordance with the\nfollowing minimum ratios. In lieu of complying with these minimum ratios, applicants may apply for approval of an\nalternative compliance parking plan, in accordance with 30-11-13. See also 30-11-4 for allowed exemptions and\nreductions. More specific use categories can be found in the district use requirements in Article 8.\n296 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum Parking Spaces for Residential Portions of Mixed Use

Location of Off-Site Parking\nOff-site parking spaces must be located within 1,000 feet of the primary entrance of the use served by the parking,\nmeasured along the shortest legal walking route. This distance limitation may be waived by the Planning Director if\nadequate assurances are offered that regularly scheduled van or shuttle service will be operated between the shared\nlot and the principal use. In addition to this distance limitation, off-site parking may not be located across an\nintervening major thoroughfare, except that off-site parking serving colleges, community-scale places of public\nassembly, universities, hospitals, convention centers, stadiums and other major public institutional facilities may be\nlocated across an intervening major thoroughfare subject to the provision of pedestrian safety measures required by\nthe Transportation Department and the Planning Department.\nB. Uses\nOff-site parking is not allowed for bars, nightclubs, brewpubs, day care and other uses that in the determination of the\nPlanning Director are not appropriate for off-site parking because of their potential for adverse, late-night impacts on\nsurrounding land uses or their potential to create unsafe pedestrian or vehicular traffic conditions.\nC. Zoning Classification\n1. Required parking spaces for uses in nonresidential zoning districts may be located in any other nonresidential\nzoning district but may not be located in any residential zoning district. Off-site parking serving uses in\nnonresidential zoning districts may be located on a residentially zoned lot only if (a) the lot immediately abuts\nthe\nnonresidential zoning district and (b) the lot is occupied by a public assembly use.\n2.

General\nAny existing tree or group of trees that meets or exceeds the standards of this subsection may be used to satisfy the\ntree conservation requirements of this section. The conservation of stands of trees is strongly encouraged. The\nconservation of individual trees is only recommended when saving a specimen tree.\nB. Standards\nTo receive tree conservation credit, trees must be protected from direct and indirect root, trunk and crown damage or\ndisturbance. The following standards apply:\n1. The tree conservation area includes land within the critical root zone. In cases where a tree inventory has not been\nsubmitted, the critical root zone area of the tree conservation area is unknown. In this case, the critical root zone\narea of the tree conservation area may be protected by an undisturbed buffer at least 25 feet in width or as\notherwise approved by the Planning Director. The 25-foot undisturbed buffer shall be measured from the trunk of\nthe outermost trees.\nFigure 12-1, Tree Conservation Area (25' Buffer)\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n308 of 472\n"}, {"page": "309", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nTree Conservation Area (25' Buffer)\nTree Conservation\nArea-Hardwoods\n4\" - 24\" DBH\nTree Protection\n25' Undisturbed Critical Root\nFence\nZone Buffer (Shaded)\n2. Construction site activities such as parking, material storage, dirt stockpiling, concrete washout and other similar\nactivities are prohibited within the tree conservation area.\n3. Changes to the grade of soil that compromise the tree conservation area by increasing or decreasing soil moisture\ncontent must be avoided.\n4.\nA reasonable effort must be made to have utility line trenches and similar uses avoid the tree conservation area.\nDue to certain site conditions, where disturbance within the tree conservation area is unavoidable, underground\ntunneling or directional boring of utilities is preferred. Trenching, with the approval of the Planning Director, may\nbe used only as the last alternative and root pruning equipment specifically designed for that purpose must be\nused.\n5. Protective fencing must be installed around the tree conservation area before any tree disturbing activities. Such\nfences must be at least 4 feet in height and must consist of orange polyethylene safety fencing. Where the tree\nprotection fence and the soil erosion control fence run congruent, the soil erosion control fence may be\nsubstituted for the tree protection fence. Fencing must remain in place until construction is complete and other\nlandscaping has been installed, and the Planning Director has approved its removal.\n6. The tree conservation area must be designated as such with \"Tree Conservation Area\" signs posted visibly on the\noutside of the fenced-in area. Signs may not be posted on trees.\nC. Evaluation of Specimen Trees and Stands of Trees\nExisting specimen trees and stands of trees must meet all of the following conditions to be considered for the tree\nconservation area:\n1. a life expectancy of greater than 10 years;\n2. a relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay; and\n3. no major insect or pathological problems.\nD. Dead or Unhealthy Trees\n1. No tree conservation credit will be allowed for any dead tree, any tree in poor health, or any tree subjected to\ngrade alterations.\n2. Maintenance of the tree conservation area is the responsibility of the property owner and/or the owners'\nassociation. All dead, dying, or substantially damaged trees shall be replaced at the rate specified in 30-5-5.5, Table\n5-2.\n3.

The 50% reforestation option still applies. On a\n10 acre site with only 0.50 acres of existing trees, for example, the owner is responsible only for preserving the\nhalf-acre of trees that do exist, not for planting another half-acre of trees. Furthermore, the owner could elect to\npreserve all of the trees or preserve half and reforest the other half.\nB. Trees to be Saved\nIf\ntrees of 4 inches or greater DBH exist within or partially within tree conservation areas, such trees must be saved to\nthe extent possible. The area will be designated TCA and may not be disturbed, except as expressly allowed under this\nsection.\nC. Smaller Trees\nTrees less than 4 inches DBH within the TCA may be preserved at the landowner's option,\nD. Other Provisions\nThe requirements of this section may be modified to permit the establishment of the TCA pursuant to 30-12-1.6.\nE. TCA Selection\nIn selecting which existing stands of trees are to be designated as TCA, the landowner must give due consideration to\nbuilding, parking lot, driveway, street and utility locations as they relate to the practicality of tree conservation and\nmust use the following tree conservation priority list:\n1. First Priority for Conservation\nExisting stands of hardwoods growing in or adjacent to stream protection buffers as highest priority\n2. Second Priority for Conservation\nExisting stands of hardwoods growing on upland sites\n3. Third Priority for Conservation\nExisting specimen trees (as determined by the Planning Director).\n4. Fourth Priority for Conservation\nExisting stands of hardwoods and pine mix.\n5. Fifth Priority for Conservation\nExisting stands of pine trees.\nF. Activities Allowed in TCA\nThe following are permitted in the required TCA with prior approval of the Planning Director, provided there is no\ndisturbance to the critical root zone of the preserved trees.\n1. Landscaping features including planting boxes, sculpture, arbors, trellises, birdbaths and wood fences, provided\nthey are installed by hand (no motorized vehicles).\n2. Outdoor furniture, ornamental entry columns and gates, flagpoles, lampposts, address posts, mailboxes, or similar\nstructures.\n3.\nCornices, steps, canopies, overhanging leaves and gutters, window sills, bay windows or similar architectural\nfeatures, fire escapes, fire balconies, and fire towers which project not more than 2.5 feet into any required TCA.\n4. Wheelchair ramps except for porches, walkways, sidewalks, and landings.\n5. Steps not connected to any above-grade structure.\n6. Trails and greenways, provided they are constructed to minimize disturbance and impacts on the TCA critical root\nzone area.\n7. Disturbance within the critical root zone will be allowed only on one side of the trees to be saved. Disturbance to\nthe critical root zone may not exceed 25% of the tree's total critical root zone area.\nG. Tree Removal Inside the Critical Root Zone (TCA)\nTrees less than 4 inches DBH not being preserved, undergrowth and plant material in poor condition may be removed\nfrom the TCA. No roots may be removed from the TCA. Stumps may be removed only by grinding. All requests for tree\nremoval within the TCA must have prior approval by the Planning Director pursuant to the provisions of this section.\nHowever, in an emergency situation due to storm damage; to alleviate an imminent hazard to the health, safety and\nwelfare of the citizens; or to repair property damage, prior approval for tree removal in previously approved\ndesignated areas is not required.\n311 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "312", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nH. Certification\nAll allowed vegetation removal must be done or supervised by an experienced urban forester, landscape architect or\ncertified arborist, who will certify that the tree and root removal or pruning was done in accordance with standard\narboricultural practices.\n30-12-1.6 Tree Conservation Flexibility Standards\nA. Undisturbed Stream Buffers\nProperties that are required to maintain an undisturbed stream buffer may use some or all the stream buffer area to\nsatisfy the required TCA if that undisturbed stream buffer contains trees that are a minimum of 4 inches in diameter at\nbreast height.\nB. Land Dedications\nLand that is dedicated to the city as open space or drainageway that is contiguous to the property being developed\nmay be credited towards meeting a site's tree conservation requirements if the dedicated land contains trees that are\na minimum of 4 inches in diameter at breast height. Land contained within dedicated utility easements may not be\ncredited toward TCA requirements.\nC. Reforestation Credits\nIn situations where TCA requirements cannot be met based on site conditions and when approved by the\nPlanning Director, reforestation efforts on the property can be used to satisfy up to 50% of the required TCA. See Table\n5-2.\nD. Alternate Methods of Compliance\nSee 30-4-11.3(C) and 30-4-11.5(B)1).\nE.

No obvious \"hangers\" shall be left in the trees after performing line clearance activities. The term hanger limb,\nas used herein, means a cut limb that is left in a tree after pruning operations are complete.\nb. Limbs shall be pruned back to an appropriate new leader, heading away or around the lines. In no\ncircumstances are stubs or abruptly pruned limbs to be left by the pruning. The term leader, as used herein,\nmeans a dominant upright stem which is usually the main trunk of a tree.\nC. Utility companies shall use natural pruning which requires all cuts to be made at laterals (limb junctions). These\nlateral limbs shall be no less than one-third the diameter of the limb removed at the point of removal. The term\nlateral limb, as used herein, means a subordinate limb originating from a main branch or stem.\nd. For the removal of a limb the triple cut method shall be used if there is a possibility that the limb may tear out\nfrom the trunk if a single cut is made.\ne. When virulent disease is prevalent, as per written notification of the Urban Forester, the Urban Forester will\nwork with the utility to develop a reasonable plan to properly prune or remove the subject tree. This plan will\nbe designed to prevent the spread of disease as a result of line clearance activities.\nf. Under normal circumstances, no more than one-fourth of a tree's crown shall be removed per year. If reduction\nof more than one-fourth or 25 percent of a tree's crown is needed for safety and reliability clearances, or if the\ntree is otherwise a danger tree, the tree should be evaluated by the utility company for removal. The term\ndanger tree, as it is used in 30-12-1.9 through 30-12-1.15 of this Ordinance, means a tree that has the potential\nof adversely impacting utility service by falling into a utility line as a result of being cut, blown into, or otherwise\nfalling, by virtue of its physical condition.\ng. The use of \"tree paint\", \"wound dressing\", and the like is not recommended.\nh. Climbing irons, spurs, or spikes are not to be used unless in accordance with the ANSI A300 standard.\ni. Topping and rounding over of trees is prohibited.\nj. Vegetation maintenance shall be done using the \"ANSI A300 method\" (part 1) BMP manual compiled by the\nInternational Society of Arboriculture, and subsequent revisions.\nB. Determinations by Utility Companies That a Tree Is To Be Removed; Appeal Process\n1. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude, prevent, or impair any property owner, resident, the City\nor utility from pursuing its legal remedies before the North Carolina Utilities Commission or from requesting the\nassistance of the Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission formally or informally at any time pursuant\nto the procedures set forth by those agencies.\n2. If a utility company determines that a tree must be removed in its entirety from Occupied Maintained Property\nwithin the City limits, then the utility company shall make reasonable efforts to seek the consent of the owner or\nresident of the Occupied Maintained Property. Reasonable efforts by a utility company to seek the consent of the\nowner or resident of the Occupied Maintained Property may include any of the following, without limitation:\na. a request for consent to remove a tree set forth on a door hanger;\nb. a request for consent to remove a tree made in a communication with said owner or resident;\nC. a request for consent to remove a tree set forth in a message left on the answering machine or voicemail of\nsaid owner or resident;\nd. a request for consent to remove a tree set forth in a letter served by mail to said owner or resident;\ne. a request for consent to remove a tree made during a meeting with said owner or resident on the affected\nproperty; or\nf. a request for consent to remove a tree served by email to said owner or resident.\nIf an owner or resident of Occupied Maintained Property expresses verbally or in writing to the utility company that\nsaid owner or resident does not consent to the tree removal intended by the utility company, then the utility company\nshall not remove the subject tree unless permitted to do so by the Urban Forester or the North Carolina Utilities\nCommission or through resolution of the matter through the involvement of the Consumer Services Division of the\nPublic Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, as provided for herein below.\n3.

They are the Watershed Critical Area (WCA) and the\nGeneral Watershed Area (GWA). The WCA covers the area adjacent to a water supply intake or reservoir where risk\nassociated with pollution is greater than from the remaining portions of the watershed. WCA outer boundaries are at\nleast one-half mile from the normal pool elevation of an existing or proposed designated reservoir. The GWA covers the\nrest of the watershed draining to the reservoir or intake. The remaining areas within the city's jurisdiction are hereby\nreferred to as Other Watershed Districts.\n(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)\n30-12-3.2 Purpose and Intent\nA. General Intent\nThe watershed protection regulations, adopted and prescribed in this ordinance, to protect the public health are\nfound by the City Council to be necessary and appropriate to:\n1. Protect stream buffers, water supply watersheds and other watersheds from activities that could degrade water\nquality in the reservoirs and streams;\n2. Reduce the volume of nutrients and other chemicals that could enter streams and the water supply by reducing\nthe amount of runoff that any given development will generate;\n3.\nMinimize land disturbance to reduce the amount of sediment washing into streams and lakes and to enhance the\ninfiltration of runoff into soils, thus alleviating the sedimentation of water supply lakes that reduces their storage\ncapacity, shortens their useful life, and makes them less able to withstand drought;\n4. Reduce the probability of the release of harmful chemicals into streams and water supply reservoirs, either\nthrough natural catastrophe or human error;\n5. Provide for natural and engineered methods for managing the stormwater that flushes contaminants off of built-\nupon areas in the water supply watersheds and other watersheds that may reach water supply reservoirs and\nstreams unless controlled.\n6. To require that new development maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in its post-development state\nas nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint and\npoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and\naquatic habitats; and\n7. To establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural\nstormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) to ensure that they continue to function as designed,\nare\nmaintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety.\nB. -WCA- Watershed Critical Area\nThe -WCA, Watershed Critical Area overlay district establishes regulations for protecting the portion of a water supply\nwatershed adjacent to a water supply intake or reservoir.\n329 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03\n"}, {"page": "330", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nC. -GWA- General Watershed Area\nThe -GWA, General Watershed Area overlay district establishes regulations for protecting the portion of a water\nsupply watershed outside the -WCA.\n(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)\n30-12-3.3 Incorporation of Designated Watershed Map(s)\nThis section incorporates by reference the Greensboro Designated Watershed Map, dated June 1, 2009, showing\nWatershed Critical Areas and General Watershed Areas of the following: Greensboro (Reedy Fork Creek), Upper\nRandleman Lake (East and West Forks of Deep River, which drain to High Point City Lake and Oak Hollow Lake), Lower\nRandleman Lake (Deep River), Lake Mackintosh (Big Alamance Creek), and Polecat Creek watersheds.

Concentrated runoff from new ditches or man-made conveyances shall be converted to diffuse flow at non-erosive\nvelocities before the runoff enters Zone 2 of the riparian protection area;\n2.\nPeriodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken by the landowner if necessary to impede the\nformation of erosion gullies; and\n3. As set out in 30-12-3.9(F) and Table 12-5, the zones of the stream buffer and Table of Stream Buffer Activities and\nStructures respectively, no new stormwater conveyances are allowed through the buffers except for those\nspecified in Table 12-5, addressing stormwater management ponds, drainage ditches, roadside ditches, and\nstormwater conveyances.\nF. Explanation of Stream Buffer Zones\nPerennial and intermittent stream buffers must be composed of 2 or 3 of the following zones, depending upon\nwhether the low-density option or the high-density option is used.\n1. Zone 1 is the portion of a riparian protection area located closest to the stream, lake, reservoir, or pond. It is\nintended to be an undisturbed area of vegetation except for activities and structures provided for in Table 12-5\nStream Buffer Activities and Structures in all Watersheds (30-12-3.9(G)3)). The location of Zone 1 shall be as\nfollows:\na. For intermittent and perennial streams, Zone 1 shall begin at the top of the bank and extend landward a\ndistance of 30 feet on all sides of the surface water, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical\nline marking the top of the bank. For ponds, lakes and reservoirs located within a natural drainage way, Zone 1\nshall begin at the normal water level and extend landward a distance of 30 feet, measured horizontally on a line\nperpendicular to a vertical line marking the normal water level. No new built-upon area is to be placed in this\nzone.\n2. Zone 2, the remainder of a riparian protection area, is intended to provide protection through a vegetated riparian\nzone which provides for diffusion and infiltration of runoff and filtering of pollutants. Zone 2 shall consist of a\nstable, vegetated area that is undisturbed except for activities and structures provided for in Table 12-5\n(30-12-3.9(G)3)). Grading and revegetating in Zone 2 is allowed provided that the health of the vegetation in Zone\n1 is not compromised. Zone 2 shall begin at the outer edge of Zone 1 and extend landward 20 feet as measured\nhorizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water. The combined width of Zone 1 and 2 shall be 50 feet on\nall sides of the surface water. No new built-upon area is to be placed in this zone.\n3. Zone 3 is not part of a riparian protection area and therefore is subject to less extensive requirements than Zones 1\nand 2. Zone 3 covers the outermost 50 feet of the 100-foot perennial stream buffer under the high-density option.\nNo new built upon area is to be placed in this zone.

Activities and Structures that are Existing and Ongoing\n30-12-3.9 shall not apply to activities and structures in the riparian protection area (Zones 1 & 2) that are legally\nexisting and ongoing. Only the portion of the buffer occupied by the footprint of the existing activity or structure is\nexempt. However, this Section shall apply at the time an existing, ongoing activity or structure is changed to\nanother activity or structure. Change of activity or structure shall involve the initiation of any activity that does not\nmeet either of the following criteria for existing, ongoing activity:\na.

Measurement in Low-density Option\n1.\nFor the low-density option, density is measured in dwelling units per acre for single-family detached residential\ndevelopment; for recreational facilities such as golf courses and tennis and swim clubs lying within such\ndevelopments, measure the built-upon area on the lot or common elements and divide by 3,000 square feet to\nobtain a dwelling units equivalency number. Density is measured in percentage of the land surface covered by\nbuilt-upon area for all other residential and nonresidential development. When buildings for single-family\ndetached residential uses and buildings for other uses are intermingled, the built-upon area measurement shall\napply. When sections devoted to single-family detached residential buildings and other sections devoted to\nbuildings for other uses are present in the same development, the developer may apply the appropriate\nmeasurements to the different uses or may use the built-upon area measurement for the entire development.\nWhen using the built-upon area measurement, assume 3,000 square feet of built-upon area per single-family\ndetached residential lot to cover the built-upon area on the lot and in the portion of its driveway within the street\nright-of-way.\n2. For single-family detached residential developments within the GWA and Other Watershed Districts, the built-upon\narea measurement can apply when the Technical Review Committee grants a Type 2 modification in accordance\nwith 30-4-11. Density is measured in percentage of the land surface covered by all built-upon area lying within\nsuch development. When using the built-upon area measurement, assume 3,000 square feet of built-upon area\nper single-family detached residential lot to cover the built-upon area on the lot and in the portion of its driveway\nwithin the street right-of-way.\nC. Measurement in High-density Option\nThe built-upon area measurement shall apply.\nD. Density Averaging\nWhen all of the following conditions are met, two non-contiguous zone lots, neither of which is publicly held land,\nmay be treated in tandem for compliance with the density requirements contained within this section. Publicly held\nlands include but are not limited to dedicated drainageway and open space, parkland, or other lands obtained for\nwatershed protection. One lot (the \"giving lot\") shall reduce its allowable development, and the other lot (the\n\"receiving lot\") shall increase its allowable development by a like amount.\n1. An Application for a Watershed Density Averaging Certificate, on a form supplied by the Department of Water\nResources, is submitted according to the established deadlines and procedures.\n2. The two lots are within the same water supply watershed, irrespective of jurisdictional boundaries;\n3. If one of the lots is located in the Watershed Critical Area, that lot shall not be developed beyond the applicable\ndensity limit listed in Table 12-6 or Table 12-7;\n4.\nThe overall density for both lots meets applicable density requirements of Table 12-6 or Table 12-7 and both lots\nmeet applicable stormwater control requirements;\n343 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03\n"}, {"page": "344", "text": "Firefox\ntp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nCommentary: The density averaging formulas would be such that the sum of the maximum \"by the watershed\nregulations book\" numbers of dwelling units (DU) on the giving property and on the receiving property, divided\nby the sum of their acreages (Ac), would be equal to the sum of the reallocated numbers of dwelling units on the\ngiving property and on the receiving property, divided by the sum of their acreages. The BUA formula would\nsubstitute square footages of BUA for numbers of dwelling units. To wit, maximum \"by the book\" [DU Property A\n+ DU Property B]/[Ac Property A + Ac Property B] = reallocated [DU Property A + DU Property B]/[Ac Property A +\nAc Property B] and maximum \"by the book\" [BUA Property A + BUA Property B]/[Ac Property A + Ac Property B] =\nreallocated [BUA Property A + BUA Property B]/[Ac Property A + Ac Property B].\n5. Built-upon areas are designed and located such that the Technical Review Committee finds that the design of each\nsite is such that all of the following are achieved:\na.

Density Averaging Easements (DAE) shall be platted over those areas that are not to be developed, which shall\nremain in a vegetated or natural state. Within such easements principal and accessory buildings and structures are\nnot permitted and the natural ground cover and the natural tree canopy must be preserved, with the following\nexceptions:\na. Utilities and associated erosion control structures may be constructed and maintained;\nb. Normal maintenance by mechanical means is allowed for the removal of dead, diseased, deformed, poisonous,\nor noxious vegetation and pests harmful to health;\nC. Mechanical mowing of utilities areas is allowed to control growth;\nd. The removal of dead trees and logs is permitted, provided the stumps remain;\ne.

Protected Drainageway means drainage is channeled by pervious devices such as sod waterways, berms,\nchannels, or swales which have been constructed to resist soil erosion by either vegetating, netting, rip-rapping,\nor a combination of those, and which allows infiltration of water into the soil.\nb. Dispersed Drainage means spread out, as opposed to collecting the runoff in channels, so as to effect increased\nsheet flow and overland flow.\nC. Improved Drainageway means channeled by impervious surfaces such as curb and gutter or concrete (gunnite,\nbituminous, etc.) channels.\nd. Enhanced Drainageway means carried by existing natural drainageways which have been enhanced to resist soil\nerosion, including stream bank degradation.\n8. Average Slope\nMeans the maximum inclination of the land surface from the horizontal as measured in percentage slope.\n9. Land is Subject to Grading or Filling\nMeans if it is in street R/W, in a lot or common elements but not covered by a water quality conservation\neasement, or in an area that will be disturbed before being dedicated to the public.\n10. Sewage Disposal\nNo points will be allowed for on-site septic tank systems or private sewage treatment systems.\n11. Wooded Area\nThickly Planted in Tree Stands means that trees (but not shrubs) are planted at a Type A number and size planting\nrate.

Plan and Permit Required\nNo person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity without a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan and a\ngrading permit approved by the city, if the land-disturbing activity:\n1. Uncovers more than one acre (lands under one ownership or diverse ownership being developed as a unit shall be\naggregated);\n2. Will take place on highly erodible soils with a \"k\" factor greater than 0.36 in a Watershed Critical Area;\n3. Includes a pond or retention structure in a Watershed Critical Area; or\n4. Will take place in Tier 1 or Tier 2 of a Watershed Critical Area.\nB. Protection of Property\nPersons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private\nproperty from damage caused by such activity. This includes installing measures to maintain sediment on site for all\nactivities even if below the formal permitting threshold.\nC. More Restrictive Rules Shall Apply\nWhenever conflicts exist between federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive provision shall\napply.\n30-12-6.2 Basic Control Objectives\nA soil erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved pursuant to 30-12-6.12(H) if the plan fails to address\nthe following control objectives:\nA. Identify Critical Areas\nOn-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from\n355 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "356", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nerosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention;\nB. Limit Time of Exposure\nAll land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time;\nC. Limit Exposed Areas\nAll land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one\ntime;\nD. Control Surface Water\nSurface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss\nduring the period of exposure;\nE. Control Sedimentation\nAll land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage; and\nF. Manage Stormwater Runoff\nWhen the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause\naccelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the point of\ndischarge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.\n30-12-6.3 Mandatory Standards for Land-disturbing Activity\nNo land-disturbing activity that is subject to control under this section may be undertaken except in accordance with the\nfollowing mandatory standards:\nA. Buffer Zone\nNo land-disturbing activity during periods of construction or improvement to land shall be permitted in proximity to a\nlake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to\nconfine visible sedimentation within the 25% of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity. Unless otherwise\nexpressly stated the width of a buffer zone is measured from the edge of the water to the nearest edge of the\ndisturbed area, with the 25% of the strip nearer the land-disturbing activity containing natural or artificial means of\nconfining visible sedimentation.\nB. Graded Slopes and Fills\nThe angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no steeper than 2:1 slope if they are to be stabilized with vegetative\ncover. Slopes or fills steeper than 2:1 slope must be protected by structures. In any event, slopes left exposed shall,\nwithin 15 days of completion of any phase of grading, be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices, or\nstructures sufficient to restrain erosion.\nC. Ground Cover\nWhenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one acre is\nuncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and erosion control\ndevices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the\nboundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract; and he shall plant or otherwise\nprovide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development.\nExcept as provided in 30-12-6.4(B)5), provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished\nwithin 15 business days or 30 calendar days following completion, whichever period is shorter.\nD. Prior Plan\nApproval No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract if more than one acre is to be uncovered\nunless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for such activity\nhas been filed, and such plan has been approved by the city.\n30-12-6.4 Design and Performance Standards\nA. Design for 10-Year Storm\nExcept as provided in 30-12-6.4(B)2), soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall\nbe so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff\nfrom the 10-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's\n\"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\" or other acceptable calculation procedures.\n356 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "357", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nB. High Quality Water Zones\nIn High Quality Water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply:\n1. Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area within the boundaries of the\ntract of 20 acres. Only the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this\nsubsection. Larger areas may be uncovered within the boundaries of the tract with the written approval of the\nDirector (DENR).\n2. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be so planned,\ndesigned, and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm which produces the\nmaximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's\n\"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\" or according to procedures adopted by any other\nagency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.\n3. Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a settling\nefficiency of at least 70% for the 40 micron (0.04 mm) size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of\nthat 2-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the\nUSDA, Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\" or according to\nprocedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization\nor association.\n4. Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper\nthan 2 horizontal to one vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a steeper\nslope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices, structural devices, or other acceptable ditch\nliners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.\n5. Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land-disturbing activity in a HQW\nzone within 15 working days or 30 calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever\nperiod is shorter.\n30-12-6.5 Stormwater Outlet Protection\nA. Intent\nStream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be protected from increased\ndegradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-disturbing activity.\nB. Performance Standard\nPersons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post-construction velocity of the 10-year storm runoff in the\nreceiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:\n1. The velocity established by 30-12-6.8; or\n2. The velocity of 10-year runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development.\n3. If conditions (1) or (2) above cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point\nshall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds the \"prior to\ndevelopment\" velocity by 10%.\nC. Acceptable Management Measures\nMeasures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no\nobjectionable secondary consequences. The city recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or\ncontrol downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be\nconsidered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results. Some alternatives are\nto:\n1. Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate\nfor increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;\n2. Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu\nof closed drains and high velocity paved sections;\n3. Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge.\nThese may range from simple riprapped sections to complex structures; or\n4. Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant\n357 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "358", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nlining.\nD. Exceptions\nSubsections (B) and (C) above shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that stormwater discharge velocities will\nnot create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse.\n30-12-6.6 Borrow and Waste Areas\nWhen the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal\nactivity, areas from which borrow is obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971,\nand waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by the Department's Division of Solid Waste\nManagement, shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from\nwhich the waste material originated. When the person conducting land-disturbing activity is not the person obtaining the\nborrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be considered a separate land-disturbing activity.\n30-12-6.7 Access and Haul Roads\nTemporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any land-disturbing\nactivity shall be considered a part of such activity.\n30-12-6.8 Operations in Lakes or Natural Watercourses\nLand-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse shall be\nplanned and conducted to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel. The relocation of a\nstream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize\nchanges in the stream flow characteristics, except when justification for significant alteration to flow characteristic is\nprovided. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall be notified by the developer of any planned operation in lakes or natural\nwatercourses for possible issuance of Section 404 or other permits.\nSource:\nAdapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with\nstraight alignment.

Purposes and Objectives\nThe regulations of this section are intended to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare by\npreventing the introduction of potentially harmful materials into the city storm sewer system; to protect property\nfrom potential stormwater damage; to maintain and enhance water quality; and to meet the requirements in the\nCity's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit for Stormwater Discharges. Other specific objectives of\nthese regulations are to:\n1. provide for the enforcement of the city's stormwater quality management program;\n2. reduce the discharge of pollutants to the storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable by requiring,\nwhere appropriate, the use of best management practices, structural and/or nonstructural stormwater quantity\nand quality control measures and other provisions;\n3. provide for the inspection and proper maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater controls and the\nmunicipal separate storm sewer;\n4. prohibit non-stormwater discharges to the city storm sewer and require the removal of illicit connections to the\ncity storm sewer;\n5. prevent improper disposal of materials that degrade water quality;\n6. permit sampling and monitoring for pollutants such as those associated with illicit discharges, improper disposal,\nindustrial and construction activities, and the application of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers; and\n7. reduce erosion associated with stormwater runoff.\nB. Applicability\nThe regulations of this section apply govern the development and use of land and structures within the corporate\nlimits of the city.\nC. Right-of-entry\n1. The Water Resources Director has the right-of-entry on or upon the property of any person subject to this chapter\nand any permit/document issued hereunder. The Water Resources Director must be provided ready access to all\nparts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, monitoring, sampling, inventory, records examination and\ncopying, and the performance of any other duties necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.\n2. Where a person has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into\nits premises, the person must make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of\n361 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "362", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nsuitable identification, the Water Resources Director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of\nperforming specific responsibilities.\n3. The Water Resources Director has the right to set up on the person's property such devices as are necessary to\nconduct sampling and/or metering of the person's operations.\n4. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the areas to be inspected and/or monitored\nshall be removed promptly by the person at the written or verbal request of the Water Resources Director. The\ncosts of clearing such access must be borne by the person.\n5. The Water Resources Director may inspect the facilities of any user in order to ensure compliance with this\nchapter. Such inspection requires the consent of the owner, manager, or signatory official. If such consent is\nrefused, the Water Resources Director may seek issuance or an administrative search warrant.\nD. Assessments\n1. Property owners of single-family homes, townhouses and condominium properties can request that City Council\napprove a resolution that allows stormwater improvement costs to be assessed against the property as a lien.\n2. The City Council is authorized to determine which stormwater improvements inside the city will be provided and\nthe type of solution, either piping or non-piping, for the improvement. The City Council likewise has the authority\nto determine the amount of construction cost to be borne by the abutting property owners and the amount to be\nborne by the city.\n3. The assessment formula for stormwater improvements using a piping solution must be set at a rate that recovers\n100% of the construction cost, including engineering, labor and materials of a 15-inch stormwater pipe or a rate\nnot to exceed 50% of the total project cost, whichever is less. The assessment formula for stormwater\nimprovements using a non-piping solution must be set at a rate of 10% of the cost, including engineering, labor\nand materials. The assessment rate must be reviewed for any necessary adjustments once a year in coordination\nwith the annual budget process.\n4. Upon receiving notice of completion of a stormwater management project, City Council must confirm all\nassessment obligations in the project and must call for advertisement of assessment obligations in a local\nnewspaper published at least weekly and that is generally available to citizens.

Rainwater leaders may not extend beyond the building or property line, but rather must be built in chases or on\nthe inside of the wall, and may not empty on any street or sidewalk.\nC.\nNo person may construct or install any ditch, pipe or other device for the diversion or transmission of storm\ndrainage that will in any way affect the operation or maintenance of city street, water, sanitary sewer or storm\nsewer facilities without a permit issued by the Water Resources Director upon a finding that such city facilities\nwill not be adversely affected by such construction or installation.\nd. Maintenance\nIn accordance with city policy the developer is responsible for establishing proper connections with existing\nstorm sewer lines and bears ultimate responsibility for the correction of any problems associated with that\nconnection. (See Roadway and Utility Design Manual)\n2. Additional Requirements\na. Parking Lot Construction and Paving\nNo new parking lot, loading dock construction, or the construction of similar structures or the grading/or\npaving of existing parking lots, loading docks, or similar structures may be undertaken until the developer\nobtains a permit from the city. The site must be inspected before, during and after construction. Any violation\nof the permit will result in permit revocation and cessation of construction until the violations are corrected.\nb. Stormwater Management\nThe design, construction, and maintenance of stormwater improvements to meet the requirements of\n30-12-7.2(B) must comply with the Stormwater Management Manual the specifications and requirements of\nwhich are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter as if set out in full.\nC. Development Policy Manual\nRESERVED\nd. Responsibility of Property Owner\nIt is the responsibility of the property owner to correct drainage controls on individual properties that do not\nfunction properly or are not constructed according to their design.\ne. New Storm Drainage Design and Construction\nAll new storm sewer infrastructure must be constructed according to the Storm Drainage Design Manual.\nB. Stormwater Management Control Requirements\n1. Purpose\nThese stormwater management control requirements are intended to protect, maintain, and enhance the public\nhealth, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse\neffects of increased stormwater runoff associated with new development or redevelopment within the city.\nAdditionally, this section requires development that drains in whole or in part to waters with special designation\nsuch as NSW or impaired waters assigned a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) by North Carolina DWQ, to be\ndesigned using best management practices, up to and including the installation of engineered stormwater controls,\nthat reduce nutrients or other pollutants of concern, to the maximum extent practicable, while still meeting other\nrequirements of this section. Proper management of stormwater runoff, including the provision of stream buffers,\nwill minimize damage to public and private property, promote a functional storm drainage system, reduce local\nflooding and drainage problems, and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-developed stormwater runoff\ncharacteristics of the developed site.\n2. Applicability\nThe stormwater management control requirements of this subsection (30-12-7.2(B)) apply to the following type of\ndevelopments.\na. All sites containing new development and/or redevelopment including grading, paving, gravel placement, and\nconstruction of buildings and other structures within the corporate limits and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of\nthe city.\nb. The construction and installation of new public improvements by federal, state or local government agencies\nshall comply with the provisions of this section to the extent practicable unless the federal, state or local\ngovernment agency has a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) stormwater permit that\n363 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "364", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\napplies to the project site.\n3. Participation in a Regional Stormwater Control Program\nSee 30-12-3.5\n4. Stormwater Management Plan\nSee 30-4-15.6(B)\n5. Stormwater Quantity and Quality Improvements\nSee 30-12-3.7\n6. Stream Protection Requirements\nSee 30-12-3.9\n7. Stormwater Management Requirements\na. Minimum stormwater management requirements for all new development and redevelopment must consist of\nrunoff control measures necessary to control runoff to a level that will not cause increased off-site quantity\nproblems as specified in 30-12-7.2(B)7)b) and 30-12-7.2(B)7)c) below.\nb. Quantity Control Requirements\ni. The engineer must provide a certification that the subject development or redevelopment would not cause\nincreased off-site flooding, drainage, or erosion problems. Determination of impacts must be based on\nhydrologic and hydraulic engineering studies extending downstream to a point where the proposed site\ndevelopment or redevelopment represents less than 10% of the total drainage area or watershed. The\nstudies must be based on an analysis of both 2- and 10-year storm events. (see Stormwater Management\nManual).\nii. If it is determined that the development of the subject site does contribute to flooding, drainage or soil\nerosion problems at any location between the proposed development site and the 10% downstream point\nthen stormwater quantity control improvements must be implemented. The stormwater quantity control\nimprovements must limit the 2-year and 10-year post-development peak discharge rates to pre-\ndevelopment peak discharge rates, to minimize increased flooding, drainage, and erosion problems. These\nimprovements may consist of nonstructural approaches such as natural swales, depressions in the land and\nother natural approaches, or structural approaches such as detention structures (wet and dry basins),\nextended detention facilities and alternative best management practices with provisions for stormwater\nquantity control. A combination of nonstructural and structural approaches is encouraged.\niii. For stormwater management improvements that are proposed to be implemented to meet the quantity\ncontrol requirements of this section, a hydrologic-hydraulic analysis of the site drainage system in the pre-\ndevelopment condition and the post-development condition must be performed. The analysis should be\nincluded with the stormwater management plan and should demonstrate that the quantity control\nrequirements stated in 30-12-7.2(B)7)b) will be achieved by the proposed improvements. These\nimprovements are subject to review and approval by the Water Resources Director.\nC. Developments that meet the requirement for being identified as an integrated multiple use developments,\nplanned unit developments, phased developments or group developments can meet the requirements of\n30-12-7.2(B)6) at the point the discharge leaves the overall property.\n8. Master Plan Requirements\nIt is the intent of the city to produce stormwater quantity and quality management master plans to guide the\ndesign and development of the drainage system for all of the major sub-watersheds and watersheds in the city.\nWhere such master plans are available and approved by the City Council, site development projects are to conform\nto the stormwater management guidance and standards available in said master plans.\n9. Additional Requirements\nIf site characteristics indicate that complying with the minimum stormwater management requirements of this\nsection will not provide adequate designs or protection for local residents, and downstream property, it shall be\nthe site designer's responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as necessary.\n10. Exempt Activities\nThe following activities are exempt from the requirements of 30-12-7.2(B)7). However, any restrictions upon\nbuilding location, drainageways, pavement, or other built-upon area, or any other matter appearing on any\npreviously approved development plan covering the subject property, shall be complied with unless and until\n364 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "365", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nreplaced by an approved revised plan.\na. Individual single-family housing on an individual lot.\nb. Replacement of existing built-upon area with like or lesser amount of new built-upon at the same location, or at\na different location on the same zone lot if the Water Resources Director has determined that equal or\nimproved stormwater management will result.\nC. Placement of small accessory buildings or structures or small amounts of additional built-upon area provided\nthat the total additional built-upon area is no greater than 400 square feet.\nd. Activities exempt from permit requirements of Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, as specified in 40\nCFR 232 are exempt from watershed requirements of this ordinance. Stream buffer requirements for ongoing\nfarming and forestry activities will be implemented and enforced by the Division of Water Quality.\n(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)\n30-12-7.3 Illicit Discharges and Improper Disposal\nA.

Drainageway and open space must be dedicated by a recorded plat and must be labeled \"Dedicated to the City of\nGreensboro and the public for Drainageway and Open Space purposes.\" If a portion of the drainageway and open\nspace lies within a proposed thoroughfare shown on the Thoroughfare Plan, it must be labeled \"Dedicated to the\nCity of Greensboro and the public for Drainageway and Open Space and Thoroughfare purposes.\"\n3.\nThe dedicated drainageway and open space area along any stream that would require a 66-inch or larger diameter\npipe must include the special flood hazard area. If there is no established flood hazard area identified on the FIRM\nor in the FIS report, the base flood elevation and one percent annual chance flood boundary are to be determined\nin accordance with 30-12-2.3(F)3). The area to be dedicated may be reduced in width by filling provided that a\nminimum average width of 200 feet is maintained, a minimum width of 100 feet is maintained at the narrowest\npoint, no fill is placed within a designated floodway, and no slope greater than 3:1 is created. The minimum\naverage width in other locations must be 60 feet.\nCommentary: Other regulations of this ordinance and/or federal wetlands regulations prohibit or restrict fill\nplacement in certain locations.\n4. In cases of severe topography or other obstacles, additional width may be required to assure reasonable ease of\nmaintenance.\n5. Dedicated drainageway and open space area must abut public street right-of-way on at least 30% of its perimeter,\nexcept when the Technical Review Committee determines that adequate access is otherwise provided. The\nminimum length of street frontage at each location where drainageway and open space abuts public street right-\nof-way must be at least 60 feet. The maximum distance between such locations, measured by straight lines on\neach side of the drainageway, may not exceed 1,000 feet.\n6. The centerline of the drainage channel that would require a 66-inch or larger diameter pipe must be located a\nminimum of 50 feet from all street and property lines, provided that the dimensions of the drainageway and open\nspace area conform to all other requirements of this section.

Dedicated drainageways may also be used to provide vehicular access to and from adjacent property\n(whether publicly or privately owned) upon property owner request if a determination is made by the\nTransportation Director that 1) the vehicular access to and from the adjacent property will enhance public safety;\nand 2) there is no other practicable method to achieve the same level of vehicular access.\n8. Dedicated drainageway and open space may be used for utility lines provided the lines are shown on approved\nconstruction and utility plans before final plat recordation or approved by the Parks and Recreation Department\nafter final plat recordation. The Parks and Recreation Director must determine vehicular access to and from\nadjacent property via the dedicated drainageway and open space does not adversely change the function of the\ndrainageway and open space for public benefit as recreational space. Vehicular access provided to and from\nadjacent property via dedicated drainageway and open space must be designed in a manner to not increase\ndownstream flood levels or create adverse drainage impacts to other properties based on a submission of\nrequested information necessary for the City to make a competent determination. Stormwater mitigation\nmeasures may be considered to achieve equal or better performance.\n9. Drainageway and open space must be left in its natural condition or graded to a cross-section approved by the city\nand stabilized with permanent vegetative cover that will allow economical and efficient maintenance. This\nprovision is not intended to prevent use of dedicated drainageway and open space areas for drainage, open space,\ngreenways, bikeways, trails, and other similar recreational improvements, or for vehicular access to and from\nadjacent property under the circumstances and approvals described above.\n10. Single-family lots abutting property 60 feet or more in width dedicated to the city and the public as drainageway\nand open space may be reduced in size in accordance with the provisions in 30-7-3.2(L).\nCommentary: See 30-4-17.8 for procedures governing dedication of open space and easements.\nD. Open Channels in Drainageway Maintenance and Utility Easements\n1. Open channels in drainageway maintenance and utility easements may not be utilized in any subdivision intended\nfor single-family detached dwellings unless the Technical Review Committee determines that an open channel\nwould not become a missing segment in a stormwater piping system and that the open channel is sufficiently\ndistant from all anticipated building locations.\n2. The drainage maintenance and utility easement must include the special flood hazard area. If there is no\nestablished flood hazard area identified on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the base flood elevation and one percent\nannual chance flood boundary are to be determined in accordance with 30-12-2. The easement may be reduced in\nwidth or shifted by modifying the topography if permitted under the flood damage prevention regulations of\n30-12-2 and the soil erosion and sedimentation provisions of 30-12-6. In such cases, the approved typical required\ndrainage channel section must include the necessary channel to accommodate a one-hundred-year flood. The area\noutside of the required drainage channel may be filled; but any resulting slope may be no steeper than 2:1, unless\nthe slope is protected by masonry paving, rip-rap, or other material that meets all city specifications.\n3. The minimum width of a drainage maintenance and utility easement may not be less than specified below if the\nedge of the easement as specified below and the edge of a required stream buffer are close to coinciding, the\nWater Resources Director may authorize the easement line to be moved to coincide with the stream buffer line.\n4.

In cases of severe topography or other obstacles, additional width may be required to assure reasonable ease of\nmaintenance.\n6. If the Technical Review Committee determines that suitable access to the drainage maintenance and utility\neasement is not provided, access must be guaranteed by a suitably located access easement not less than 20 feet\nin width.\n7. It is solely the owner's responsibility to maintain all streams and all required stream buffers located within the\neasement.\n8. If the City Council determines that it is in the public interest to alter the typical required channel section and/or\nprofile of the stream to improve flow, the city may enter the property within the indicated access or drainage\nmaintenance and utility easement and carry out the necessary work without liability for damage to the property or\nimprovements located within the easement.\n9. No buildings or structures, except for water-related improvements, may be placed or constructed within the access\nor drainage maintenance and utility easement except as expressly allowed as easement encroachments. Drives,\nparking areas, or other improvements may be constructed no closer than 2 feet horizontally from the top of any\nback slope along any open watercourse.\n10.

Subdivision Standards\n30-13-1 Purpose\nIn addition to promoting the general purposes of this ordinance, the subdivision design and improvement standards of\nthis article (and the subdivision review and approval procedures of 30-4-17) are intended to help:\n30-13-1.1 facilitate the creation of accurate and permanent public records of the separate interests created and\nconveyed by the subdivision of land, and in turn, help to protect private property rights and city property;\n30-13-1.2 promote the timely and coordinated provision of streets, sidewalks, utilities and other required\nfacilities and improvements to serve new developments;\n30-13-1.3 ensure that proposed lots are capable of being built upon in accordance with applicable city standards;\nand\n30-13-1.4 ensure subdivision designs and layouts that promote beneficial development of the community.\n30-13-1.5 Development Name\nThe name of a proposed subdivision or development may not duplicate or be so similar to the name of an existing\nsubdivision or development that it is reasonable to conclude that the name will cause confusion for public safety and\nother parties. Proposed subdivisions or developments may have the same or similar name if they are an extension of an\nexisting subdivision or development with the same or similar name. The Planning Director has final authority to approve\nsubdivision and development names.\n30-13-1.6 Reasonable Relationship\nAll required improvements, easements, and rights-of-way (other than required reservations) must substantially benefit\nthe development and bear a reasonable relationship to the need for public facilities and improvements attributable to the\nnew development.\n30-13-2 Streets\n30-13-2.1 Traffic Movement and Pedestrian Circulation Principles\nThe street and pedestrian circulation layout in new subdivisions should be laid out and designed with due regard for\ntopography and drainage and to the extent practicable to:\nA. create an integrated system of lots, streets, trails, and infrastructure that provides for efficient movement of\npedestrians, bicycles and automobiles within the subdivision and to and from adjacent development;\nB. provide for the efficient movement of through traffic by providing an interconnected hierarchy of streets in order to\navoid isolation of residential areas and over-reliance on thoroughfares;\nC. provide pedestrian routes to nearby pedestrian activity areas, as well as nearby shopping, public/civic, employment\nand recreation uses; and\nD. provide a street network that helps emergency services, public services, and visitors find their way to their intended\ndestinations.\n30-13-2.2 Dedication of Right-of-Way\nRight-of-way for public streets must be dedicated to the city pursuant to NCGS Article 8 of Chapter 160D, and other\napplicable state laws. When dedication cannot be required, the plat must plat show how the development\naccommodates any future street right-of-way indicated on the adopted Thoroughfare Plan or Collector Street Plan.\n380 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "381", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\n(Amended by Ord. 21-127 on 8/17/21)\nEffective on: 8/17/2021\n30-13-2.3 Conformance with Thoroughfare and Collector Street Plans\nThe location and design of streets must be in conformance with applicable thoroughfare and collector street plans.\nWhere conditions warrant, right-of-way widths and pavement widths in excess of the minimum street standards may be\nrequired.\n30-13-2.4 Street System Layout\nA. Streets must be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of streets and dedicated rights-of-way as\nestablished in the Comprehensive Plan, the Thoroughfare Plan and Collector Street Plan.\nB.\nStreets must be properly related to special traffic generators, such as industries, business districts, schools, religious\nassembly uses, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.\nC. Local streets must be laid out to conform as much as possible to topography, to provide for the efficient dispersal of\ninternal traffic while discouraging high volumes of through traffic, and to permit efficient drainage and accommodate\nutility systems.\nD. The use of an interconnected street system must be used to broadly disperse internal traffic and provide maximum\nreasonable alternatives for access to property. The street connectivity policy referenced in 30-13-2.5 applies.\nE. The use of curvilinear streets is encouraged where conformance with existing topography would minimize the volume\nof cut and fill.\nF. Street designs such as loop streets or closes are preferred to the use of traditional cul-de-sac designs. Cul-de-sacs are\nencouraged where topographic features, natural resources or configuration of property boundaries prevent street\nconnections. These alternatives help support the turning movements of emergency and service vehicles.\nG. Proposed streets must be extended (stubbed) to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided when necessary to\nafford desirable and safe street access to adjoining properties. The Technical Review Committee may waive the\nrequirement for stub streets when topography, abutting development conditions, natural resources or other physical\nconditions make street extensions impractical and when the Technical Review Committee determines that\nan\ninterconnected street network is unnecessary or undesirable.\n30-13-2.5 Street Connectivity\nAn interconnected street system is necessary in order to promote orderly and safe development. This is done by ensuring\nthat streets function in an interdependent manner, provide adequate access for emergency and service vehicles, enhance\naccess by ensuring connected transportation routes, and provide continuous and comprehensible traffic routes. See the\nConnectivity Policy for additional information.\n30-13-2.6 Temporary Turnarounds\nA. A temporary turnaround must be provided at the end of any stub street over 150 feet length or serving more than 4\nlots. Temporary turnarounds must comply with the following:\n1. the turnaround must be constructed in a temporary easement or within the public right-of-way;\n2. the developer of the adjacent property making a road connection to the existing stub road is responsible for the\nremoval of the turnaround for the restoration of the area at the time that the road connection is made, and any\nadditional improvements required by the city; and\n3. The turnaround must comply with all applicable temporary turnaround standards, including the Street Design\nStandards Manual and the Roadway and Utility Design Standards.\n4. Temporary turnarounds may not be used for parking and/or driveways.\nB. Any plat containing a stub street must include the following notes:\n1. \"The street system shown on this plat includes one or more stub streets that are intended to be connected to the\n381 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "382", "text": "Firefox\nadjacent property at such time that the property is developed.

If the runoff control structure has been completed, with full design volume available (this may require the cleanout\nand disposal of sediment from the engineered stormwater control), when the plat is recorded, it shall be labeled as\nexisting and an Engineer's Certification of Stormwater Control Completion must be included on the plat (See\n30-4-15.6(B)6)).\n2. If the structure has not been completed, it must be labeled as proposed, a performance guarantee for its\ncompletion within one year, with full design volume available, must be provided in accordance with 30-4-20, and a\nprominent asterisk must be placed on the lot accompanied by a note on the plat stating that\na. no certificate of occupancy may be issued for any building on that lot until the engineered stormwater controls\nhave been completed, certified, and approved and\n389 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "390", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nb.\n(the name of the person/developer) has posted a financial guarantee and bears responsibility for its timely\ncompletion.\n3. If the Water Resources Director determines that there is a potential risk that underground rock, buried materials,\nsprings, underground utility lines, or some other obstacle may make construction of the structure unviable, the\nWater Resource Director is authorized to require that excavation for the structure be successfully performed prior\nto acceptance of the performance guarantee.\n(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)\n30-13-5.5 Engineered Stormwater Control Maintenance Agreements\nA. The proposed engineered stormwater control maintenance agreement must be reviewed and approved by the\ngovernmental office having jurisdiction for watershed protection and Planning Director prior to recordation.\nB. The agreement must state which lot is responsible for maintenance and include provisions (including easement to\nenter lot, if applicable) to allow the other lot to maintain the device, if that lot does not perform the maintenance.\nC. The agreement must provide that the property owner or owners' association is responsible for maintenance of the\nengineered stormwater control, as directed by the governmental office having jurisdiction for watershed protection.\nD. Specify whether and how the maintenance costs will be shared, in accordance with the following options:\n1. the parties to the agreement must agree to share the cost of any required maintenance on the engineered\nstormwater control, based upon a percentage calculated by taking the amount of built upon area or drainage area\nfrom each site contributing flow to the engineered stormwater control and dividing it by the total built upon area\nor drainage area flowing into the engineered stormwater control from all sites; or\n2. the property owner must maintain the engineered stormwater control and indemnify abutting users.\nE. The agreement must provide that the expenditures for required maintenance will be validated by copies of\nmaintenance notifications and invoices for expenses incurred.\nF. The agreement must provide that all parties will be notified when additional maintenance agreements are made\ninvolving the engineered stormwater control. As part of notification, give total acreage involved with the engineered\nstormwater control and the new pro-rata percentage for each property.\nG.\nThe agreement must not have an expiration date but must be perpetual.\nH. The agreement must be recorded with the Guilford County Register of Deeds, along with the final plat.\nI. Agreements involving an owners' association must be made by and for the owners' association.\nJ. The agreement must provide that amendments to the agreement relating to the maintenance and ownership of the\nengineered stormwater control will not be permitted without review and approval by the governmental office having\njurisdiction for watershed protection.\nK. The agreement must specify that the maintenance agreement can be voided only if all of the following conditions\nexist:\n1. both parties agree;\n2. the off-site property owner complies with watershed protection requirements by some other means; and\n3. the governmental office having jurisdiction for watershed protection approves the new means of watershed\nprotection.\nL. The owner of the engineered stormwater control has expended a significant amount of capital in the construction of\nthe engineered stormwater control and bears the burden of increased liability for his property due to the existence of\nthe engineered stormwater control and can therefore expect to recoup a reasonable percentage of this cost as a result\nof this agreement. \"Reasonable\" will be interpreted in a manner similar to the percentage of maintenance cost\ncomputation.\n(Amended by Ord. 10-161 on 12/1/10)\n30-13-6 Sites for Public Use\nIn subdividing property, due consideration must be given by the subdivider to the reservation of suitable sites for schools\n390 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03\n"}, {"page": "391", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nand other public uses in accordance with NCGS 160D-804.\n(Amended by Ord. 21-127 on 8/17/21)\nEffective on: 8/17/2021\n30-13-7 Monuments\nPermanent monuments must be installed in accordance with Standards of Practice for Land Surveying in North Carolina,\nas adopted by the North Carolina state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors.\n30-13-8 Condominium Development\nCondominiums must be recorded in compliance with the North Carolina Condominium Act (NCGS $47C).\n30-13-9 Owners' Associations\n30-13-9.1 Establishment\nA. Creation\nAn owners' association must be established to fulfill requirements of the North Carolina Condominium Act and to\naccept conveyance and maintenance of all common elements and facilities within a subdivision or development\ncontaining common elements. The owners' association must be in legal existence prior to the conveyance,\nlease-\noption, or other long-term transfer of control of any unit or lot in the development.\nB. Conveyance\nWhere developments have common elements serving more than one dwelling unit, these common elements must be\nconveyed to the owners' association, in which all owners of lots in the development must be members. All common\nelements other than public street rights-of-way, other areas dedicated to the city, and lots must be designated as\ncommon elements. In a condominium development the common element must be platted as common elements in\naccordance with the NC Condominium Act. In other developments, fee-simple title must be conveyed by the\nsubdivider or developer to the owners' association when the plat is recorded.\nC. Subdivision or Conveyance of Common Elements\nCommon elements may not subsequently be subdivided or conveyed by the owners' association unless a revised\npreliminary plat and a revised final plat showing such subdivision or conveyance have been submitted and approved.\nD. Minimize Number of Associations\nDevelopments, whether including different land uses, different types of housing, or simply different sections, must\nhold the number of owners' associations to a minimum. An association may establish different categories of\nmembership, different budgets for the categories, and different rates of assessment when different kinds of services\nare provided to different categories. Smaller associations under an umbrella (master) association are permitted.\nE. Owners' Association Not Required\nA development involving only 2 units attached by a party wall (or 2 separate walls back-to-back) is not required to\nhave common elements or an owners' association. Such developments without an owners' association must establish\na maintenance agreement between owners to govern any party walls and to ensure reciprocal easement rights\nneeded for maintenance.\nF. Common Elements in Subdivision Phases\nCommon elements required by this ordinance must be provided within each phase of the subdivision in an amount\nproportional to the size of the phase under review. Common elements can be counted cumulatively, including all\nsections recorded to date.\n30-13-9.2 Submission of Owners' Association Declaration\nAfter preliminary plat approval, and before any building permit issuance, it is recommended that the subdivider submit\nfor review and approval a draft of the declaration of the owners' association containing covenants and restrictions\n391 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "392", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\ngoverning the owners' association, lots or units, and common elements. Prior to or concurrently with the submission of\nthe final plat for review and approval, the subdivider must submit a copy of the final declaration for review and approval.\nThe declaration must include provisions for the following:\nA. Membership\nMembership in the owners' association is mandatory for each original purchaser and each successive purchaser of a\nlot or unit. Provisions must be made for the addition of owners in subsequent sections of the development.\nB. Responsibilities of Association\nThe declaration must state that the owners' association is responsible for:\n1. payment of premiums for liability insurance and local taxes and fees;\n2. maintenance of recreational, engineered stormwater control and/or other facilities located on the common\nelements; and\n3. payment of assessments for all public and all private improvements made to or for the benefit of the common\nelements.\nC. Exterior Maintenance of Units\nThe owners' association must be made responsible for exterior maintenance of all attached units (whether they be\ndwelling units or nonresidential units); or each unit owner must be made responsible, with the owners' association\ngranted authority to perform such exterior maintenance in the event the unit owner fails to do so in a prompt and\nsatisfactory manner and to assess the cost of the maintenance against the unit.\nD. Default By Association\nIf the owners' association defaults on payments to the jurisdiction entitled to payments of any assessments for public\nimprovements or ad valorem taxes levied against the common elements, and the default continues for a period of 6\nmonths or more, each owner of a lot in the development must pay to the jurisdiction a portion of the taxes or\nassessments in an amount determined by dividing the total taxes and/or assessments due to the jurisdiction by the\ntotal number of lots in the development. If the sum is not paid by the owner 30 days following receipt of notice of the\namount due, the sum will become a continuing lien on the property of the owner, the owner's heirs, devisees,\npersonal representatives, and assigns. The taxing or assessing jurisdiction may either bring an action at law against the\nowner personally obligated to pay, or may elect to foreclose the lien against the property of the owner.\nE. Powers of the Association\nThe owners' association is empowered to levy assessments against the owners of lots or units within the\ndevelopment. Such assessments must be for the payment of expenditures made by the owners' association for the\nitems set forth in this section, and any assessments not paid by the owner against whom such assessments are made\nwill constitute a lien on the lot of the owner.\nF. Easements\nEasements over the common elements for access, ingress, and egress from and to public streets and walkways, and\neasements for enjoyment of the common elements and for parking, must be granted to each lot owner.\nG. Maintenance and Restoration\nProvisions for maintenance and restoration in the event of destruction or damage must be established for common\nelement improvements and party walls.\nH. Parking Allocation in Nonresidential Developments\nIn nonresidential owners' association developments, the declaration must contain the following provision: \"Parking\nspaces must be allocated among the individual lots or units in such a manner that each unit is entitled to a sufficient\nnumber of parking spaces to comply with this ordinance for the use intended to be located therein. The owners'\nassociation must maintain a register listing the total number of parking spaces in the development and the number of\nspaces allocated to each lot or unit. A copy of this register must be available to the Planning Director upon request.\nThe owners' association may not reduce the number of parking spaces allocated to an individual lot or unit without\nthe express written consent of the subject owner, and in no case may the number of parking spaces allocated to an\nindividual lot or unit be reduced to a number below that required by this ordinance.\"\nI. Owners Association with a Private Wastewater Treatment, Collection and Disposal System\nThe Declaration for an owners' association, responsible for the maintenance of a private wastewater treatment,\ncollection and disposal system, must contain the following provisions:\n1. The wastewater collection system with pumps, wastewater treatment works, and/or disposal facilities, including all\n392 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "393", "text": "Firefox\ntp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nappurtenances (the \"disposal system\") must be part of the common elements.\n2. The disposal system must be properly maintained and operated by the owners' association in conformity with law\nand the provisions of the permit for construction, operation, repair and maintenance of the system and facilities,\nas required by Title 15A, Subchapter 2T of the North Carolina Administrative Code.\n3. The disposal system must be maintained out of the common expenses of the owners' association, and must\nreceive the highest priority for expenditures by the owners' association except for federal, state and local taxes and\ninsurance.\n4. In order to assure that there will be funds readily available to repair, maintain or construct the disposal system,\nbeyond the routine operation and maintenance expenses, a separate fund must be created out of the common\nexpenses. Such funds must be separate from the routine maintenance funds allocated for the disposal system and\nmust be part of the yearly budget.\n5. In the event the common expense allocation and separate fund are not adequate for the construction, repair and\nmaintenance of the disposal system, the owners' association is authorized to levy special assessments to cover the\nnecessary costs. There will be no limit on the amount of special assessments, and any such special assessments\ncan be made as necessary at any time.\n6. The owners' association may not enter into voluntary dissolution without first having transferred its disposal\nsystem to another person acceptable to and approved by the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission or appropriate delegated authority, by the issuance of a permit.\n7. The owners' association may not transfer, convey, assign or otherwise relinquish or release its responsibility for the\noperation and maintenance of its disposal system until a permit has been issued by the North Carolina\nEnvironmental Management Commission or appropriate delegated authority, to the owners' association successor.\nJ. In owners' association for subdivisions located within both AO-A and AO-B of the Airport Overlay District, the\ndeclaration must contain the following provision: \"This property is located within the Airport Overlay District and is\nsubject to both day and nighttime aircraft overflights and to aircraft noise that may increase in the future and that you\nmay find to be objectionable dependent upon the use and location of the property.\"\n(Amended by Ord. 21-074 on 6/15/21)\nEffective on: 6/15/2021\n30-13-10 Conversion of Nonconforming Development\nIf\na nonconforming use or nonconforming building is converted into a condominium or other owners' association\ndevelopment, the declaration and final plat must disclose such nonconformity and explain potential consequences of\nsuch nonconforming status.\nArticle 14. Sign Regulations\n30-14-1 Purpose\nThe sign regulations of this article are intended to achieve balance among the following differing, and at times, competing\ngoals:\n30-14-1.1 to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication for businesses, organizations and\nindividuals;\n30-14-1.2 to provide a means of way-finding, thus reducing traffic confusion and congestion;\n30-14-1.3 to provide for adequate business identification, advertising, and communication;\n30-14-1.4 to prohibit signs of such excessive size and number that they obscure one another to the detriment of\nthe economic and social well-being of the city;\n30-14-1.5 to protect the safety and welfare of the public by minimizing hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic;\n393 of 472\n10/9/2023, 2:03 PM\n"}, {"page": "394", "text": "Firefox\nhttp://online.encodeplus.com/regs/greensboro-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\n30-14-1.6 to preserve property values by preventing unsightly and cluttered development that has a blighting\ninfluence upon the community;\n30-14-1.7 to differentiate among those signs that, because of their location or type, may distract drivers on public\nstreets and those that may provide information to them while they remain in their cars but are out of active traffic\nand;\n30-14-1.8 to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property.\n30-14-2 Substitution of Messages\nThe sign regulations of this article are not intended to favor commercial speech over constitutionally-protected political\nor noncommercial speech.
