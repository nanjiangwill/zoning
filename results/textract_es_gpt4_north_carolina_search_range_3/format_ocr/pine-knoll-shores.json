District standards appear in Section 8.4-1 below and\ndistrict uses appear in Table 8.1.\nThe Manufactured Home Overlay District (MHO) is established to protect the standard of\nliving and neighborhood conditions. Established standards that will enable the use of\ninnovative manufactured homes with a higher aesthetic standard will invigorate these\ncommunities. Non-conforming manufactured home parks that have not received\napproval for continuation would be amortized over a period of time to allow the\nowner/operator to meet reasonable financial payback expectations in accordance with\naccepted practices in North Carolina. Existing parks could be limited to less fundamental\nstandards and specifications, while new parks are required to meet a higher standard.\nThese parks may be ideally suited for alternative designs such as Tiny House, Park\nModel, and other styles of housing where installation standards are considered temporary.\nThe overlay could be expanded to apply to permanent installations of innovative\nmanufactured housing in subdivisions or parks in accordance with G.S. 160D-909.\nDistrict standards appear in Section 8.5-4 below and district uses appear in Table 8.1.\nThe Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TNDO) provides an\nalternative opportunity applicable only upon request for a Zoning Map Amendment for\nthe development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing\nneighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of\ninterconnecting pedestrian-oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional\nNeighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices,\nprominently sited civic or community building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and\nchurches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood\nDevelopment (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is\na quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form and is typically an extension\nof the existing developed area of the Town. TNDO districts should have a significant\nportion of land dedicated to improved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces\nwhere environmentally sensitive areas are located.

The\nsuburban scenic corridor evokes a sense of traveling through an undeveloped\narea, with pastoral scenes and a sense of being removed from the urban\nenvironment.\n(2.) Gateway Scenic Corridor - A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a\nplace that is unique and different from other communities in the area. The\ngateway corridor provides a sense of arrival to a place that is special and\ndifferent from the typical places. The gateway scenic corridor may be more\ndeveloped than the suburban scenic corridor, but the character of the\ndevelopment is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in a\nspecial place.\nPine Knoll Shores Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 19\n"}, {"page": "166", "text": "(B.)

In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic\ncorridors shall be limited to the following:\n(a.) The scenic corridor easement may be used for passive recreation,\nagricultural uses, and equestrian uses. No other use shall be listed within\nthe scenic corridor easement.\n(b.) No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree\nremoval, lighting (other than street lighting provided by the Town of Pine\nKnoll Shores and driveway or private road lighting provided that said\nlighting is provided by full cutoff fixtures), or other development activity\nshall occur within the scenic corridor easement except as follows:\n(i.) A bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be\nlocated within the scenic corridor easement.\n(ii.) Underground utilities and easements for underground utilities may be\nlocated within the scenic easement, provided that no above ground\ntransmission or other equipment is located within the scenic easement.\n(iii.) Buildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related\nactivities may be built in the scenic corridor easement upon approval\nby the Town Board of Commissioners as a Special Use. Parking shall\nbe located behind the building, shall not be located within the scenic\neasement, and shall be buffered from the scenic corridor. The Town\nBoard of Commissioners shall consider the following items in making\nthe decision to allow aforesaid buildings in the scenic easement:\nThe building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\n2.\nThe building's size;\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with community\ncharacter and the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n(3.) Scenic Corridor Dimensions. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the\nfollowing dimensional standards:\n(a.) The width of the scenic easement within the Suburban Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of\nthe public right-of-way.

The width of the scenic easement within the Gateway Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 50 feet from the edge of the\nNC Highway 58 right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to\npreserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\nPine Knoll Shores Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 20\n"}, {"page": "167", "text": "(4.) Scenic Corridor Provisions. The following provisions shall govern\ndevelopment within a designated scenic corridor:\n(a.) The area within the scenic easement may be dedicated to the Town as a\nconservation easement, provided it meets the standards for such an\neasement as established by applicable state and federal standards.\n(b.) Development density shall be calculated for the entire property, including\nthe area within the scenic easement, with the exception that development\ndensity bonuses of up to 50 percent are given for the portion of the\nproperty within the scenic easement. In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to 75% for the area located within the\nscenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a 10-acre property zoned Single-Family\nResidential (SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic\nCorridor Overlay. The density is calculated as follows:\nBase density @ 3 units/acre X 10 acres I 30 units\n50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic corridor easement\n50% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) 3-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 33units\nIf the Jones' provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a\n75% density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units\n75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider easement\n75% of (2 acres x3 units/acre) = 4.5-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 35 units\n(c.) Development may be clustered on the portion of the property located\noutside the scenic easement.\n(5.) Curb Cuts. There shall be a minimum separation of 500' between curb cuts\nin the suburban scenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived\nby the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator if the width of the\nproperty frontage would preclude a second curb cut meeting this spacing\nrequirement.\n(6.) Lot Standards & Specifications. The lot type standards and building type\nstandard listed in the underlying district, as set forth in section 8.4 and further\ndescribed in Article 9, shall apply in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(C.) Open Space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Article 21. Land within the scenic easement may count\nfor up to 100% of the minimum open space required by Article 21 of this\nOrdinance.\n(D.) Parking & Landscaping. Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in\nArticle 12.

The standards\nand specifications set forth below are established to ensure that new development and\nconstruction is enduring and compatible with the character of the Town of Pine Knoll\nShores, that it accomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it achieves the goals\nidentified in \"the Plan\" referenced in Article 1 of this Ordinance and other adopted and\nor approved plans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1 Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Pine Knoll\nShores. The detached house building type is generally found in residential\nneighborhoods, although it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in\ncommercial or mixed-use areas. Where possible, structures should be designed to\nmaintain a harmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance.\nWhere appropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. For\ndetached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive, building placement and site\nplanning shall be dictated by landscape features and landscape preservation. Within\nthe limits described below and unless the zoning district standards require greater\nmeasures, these regulations shall apply to all houses built in the Town of Pine Knoll\nShores.\nThe photographs of detached single-family houses in the Carolinas below are\nexamples for illustration purposes only and not intended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\nPine Knoll Shores Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 1\n"}, {"page": "183", "text": "9.2-2 Detached House Lot Type.\n(A.)

Civic buildings are used for purposes that are public in nature (e.g.\nschools, libraries, government buildings, and churches). These buildings must be\ndesigned to take their appropriate places within neighborhoods as integral parts of\nthe community. It is expected that the scale and architectural sophistication of these\nbuildings will match their civic importance Civic structures should be designed to\nserve as key focal points in the neighborhood. When located at intersections or other\nappropriate locations, Civic Buildings shall be designed to terminate vistas. The\nintention of buildings in all locations must be to relate the principal facade to the\nsidewalk and public space of the street. Civic buildings shall not be set back on the lot\nbehind a standard parking lot; however, a plaza may be used for occasional parking\nand/or passenger drop-off. Large institutions with multiple buildings are encouraged\nto adopt campus master plans.\nThe photograph below is an example located in Kannapolis, North Carolina for\nillustration purposes only and is not intended to regulate lot/building styles, patterns,\nor forms.\nPine Knoll Shores Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 13\n"}, {"page": "195", "text": "9.5-2 Civic Building Lot Type.\n(A.)
