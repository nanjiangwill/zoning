Action by the Planning Board.\nPrior to consideration by the Town Council of the proposed zoning amendment, the Planning Board shall advise and comment on\nwhether the proposed text amendment or map amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan. The Planning Board shall provide\na written recommendation to the Town Council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the\nPlanning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not\npreclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Town Council.

If no recommendation is received from the Planning Board within 30 days\nfrom the date when submitted to the Planning Board, the petitioner may take the proposal to the Town Council without a\nrecommendation from the Planning Board. However, the Planning Board may request the Town Council to delay final action on the\namendment until such time as the Planning Board can present its recommendations.\n4.6.4.2. After receiving a recommendation from the Planning Board on a proposed amendment, the Town Council may proceed to vote\non the proposed ordinance, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of\nprocedure.\n4.6.4.3. The Town Council is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment within any specific period of time, but it should\nproceed as expeditiously as practicable on petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring\nunnecessary costs.\n4.6.4.4.

When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the Town Council shall approve a brief statement describing\nwhether its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. The requirement for a plan consistency statement\nmay also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the Town Council that at the time of action on the amendment the Town Council\nwas aware of and considered the Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If a\nzoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have\nthe effect of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan\namendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan consistency\nstatement is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the\nTown Council statement describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the\nrelevant adopted plans were considered in the action taken.\n4.6.4.5.1.

If a zoning map\namendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the Town Council statement on reasonableness may\naddress the overall rezoning.\n4.6.4.5.2. The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be approved as a\nsingle statement.\n4.6.4.6. In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this Ordinance, the central issue before the Town Council is whether\nthe proposed amendment advance the public health, safety, or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant and all information related to\nother issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the Mayor and excluded. When considering proposed map\namendments:\n4.6.4.6.1. The Town Council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the\nrezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification.

Lot Not Meeting Minimum Lot Size Requirements.

Nonconforming\nuses may be continued subject to the limitations noted herein. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming\nsituation is lost pursuant to this section, all buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a\nwhole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming\nmanufactured home park for 365 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the\napartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a\nnonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.\n9.3.1. Expansions. No nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged, or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land,\nbuildings, or structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a nonconforming use\nmay be extended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became\nnonconforming.\n9.3.2.

Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major\nrenovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than 75 percent of the appraised valuation as determined by the current county real\nproperty tax assessment of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this\nsection.\n9.4.2. If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or\nreplacement would not exceed 75 percent of the Brunswick County tax value or the appraised valuation by a North Carolina licensed\nappraiser of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit\nissued pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures\nmay be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in subsection 9.3.\n9.4.3. The UDO Administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that, in completing the renovation, repair or\nreplacement work:\n9.4.3.1.

Residential structures removed from a V-zone due to FIRM map revisions that are damaged greater than as described in Section\n9.4.2 above may be restored to their original footprint and height, but may not be enlarged or expanded and must meet all other local,\nstate, and federal regulations.\n9.4.5. Multi-family structures damaged as described in Section 9.4.2 above may be restored to their original footprint and density, but\nmay not be enlarged or expanded.

If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is (i) discontinued for a\nconsecutive period of 365 days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then that\nproperty may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with\nauthority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the\nnonconforming situations. The zoning permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that eliminating a particular\nnonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the\nnonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify\nwhich nonconformities need not be corrected.\n9.6.2. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the\nbuildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one\napartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 365 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space\nthereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in\nconjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain\nit thereafter.\n9.6.3.

All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 365 days before the effective date of this Ordinance as well\nas all nonconforming projects that are at least 25 percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective\ndate of this Ordinance may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were validly issued and\nremain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the\nparticular phase under construction.\n9.7.2. Except as provided in subsection 9.7.1, and except to the extent that a developer has a vested right as set forth in Section 4.7, all\nwork on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this Ordinance, and all permits previously issued for work on\nnonconforming projects shall be revoked unless the developer requests an appeal to the Board of Adjustment to overturn the UDO\nAdministrator's decision. An appeal shall stay any revocation. The UDO Administrator shall issue such a permit if he/she finds that the\napplicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his position\nin some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the Ordinance as it existed before the effective date of this Ordinance and thereby\nwould be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may be\nmade, the UDO Administrator shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations:\n9.7.2.1. All expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a building, zoning, sign, or special use permit that was validly issued and that\nremains unrevoked shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance\nbecame effective.\n9.7.2.2. Except as provided in subdivision 9.7.2.1, no expenditures made more than 365 days before the effective date of this Ordinance\nmay be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became effective. An\nexpenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure.\n9.7.2.3. To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having\nmade those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditures to acquire a\npotential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old.\n9.7.2.4. To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can\nbe effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such\nexpenditures.\n9.7.2.5. A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if the person (i) had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the\nOrdinance affecting the proposed development site which could not be attributed to him, or (ii) should have known of the proposed\nchange in the Ordinance.\n9.7.2.6. Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site, the UDO\nAdministrator may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the\nrequirements of the proposed Ordinance. The UDO Administrator may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to avoid\nrequirements of the proposed Ordinance if he/she determines that (i) at the time the expenditures were made it was not clear that the\nproposed Ordinance would prohibit the intended development, and (ii) the developer had legitimate business reasons for making\nexpenditures.\n9.7.2.7. In deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section, the UDO Administrator shall not be limited to either denying\na permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project (or phases, sections, or stages thereof) as originally proposed or\napproved. Upon proper submission of plans by the applicant, the UDO Administrator may also issue a permit authorizing a\ndevelopment that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the\nprovisions of the Ordinance making the project nonconforming. The UDO Administrator shall not allow the nonconforming project to be\nconstructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to recoup and obtain a\nreasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made in connection with that nonconforming project.\n9.7.3. When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in\nphases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect\n107 of 205\n3/16/24, 13:11\n"}, {"page": "108", "text": "Oak Island, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nto which the developer can make the showing required under subsection 9.7.2 and obtain permits. In addition to the matters and subject\nto the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 9.7.2.1 through 9.7.2.7, the UDO Administrator shall, in determining whether a developer would\nbe unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in\naddition to other relevant factors:\n9.7.3.1. Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding incompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction\ndrawings based upon detailed surveying, architectural, or engineering work.\n9.7.3.2.

Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this\narticle may be continued.\n9.9.2. No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without\nlimiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the\nnonconforming condition; nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign.\n9.9.3. A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this article.\n9.9.4. If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in\nconformity with all the provisions of this Ordinance, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For\npurposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is destroyed if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former\nstature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign damaged.\n9.9.5. The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformity (for example, by\ncreating an off-premises sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed).\n9.9.6. Subject to other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work\ndoes not exceed within any 12-month period 75 percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign or appraised tax\nvalue of a replacement.\n9.9.7.

The Oak Island Town Council does hereby find and declare the outdoor placement of signs to be a legitimate use of private\nproperty but that the erection of signs should be controlled and regulated in order to promote the health, safety, welfare and\nconvenience and enjoyment of travel on and protection of the public investment in streets and roads in Oak Island and to promote the\nreasonable, orderly and effective display of such signs, displays and devices. Signs can obstruct views, distract motorists, displace\nalternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this section is to regulate the size,\ncolor, illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation,\nthus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and\nharmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging\neconomic development. This section allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design,\nlocation, size, safety, and purpose of all signs. This section must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment\nguarantee of free speech. If any provision of this section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not\naffect the validity of other provisions of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision.\n10.22.2. A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted\ntherein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the\nintent of this article is to regulate signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant\nand are adequate for their, intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection 10.22.1 of\nthis section.\n10.22.3. These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are\nappurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are\nnot distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.\n10.22.4. These regulations distinguish between portions of the town designed for primarily vehicular access and portions to the town\ndesigned for primarily pedestrian access.\n10.22.5. These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the\njurisdictional limits of the town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully\naffect one or more of the purposes set forth above.\n10.22.6. These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather,\nthey strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and\nmitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs.\n10.22.7.
