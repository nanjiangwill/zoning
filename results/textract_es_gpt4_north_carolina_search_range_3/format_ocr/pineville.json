Stream systems are comprised of the stream and their\ndrainage basins. Streams have the primary natural functions of conveying storm and ground\nwater, storing floodwater and supporting aquatic and other life. Vegetated lands adjacent to the\nstream channel in the drainage basin serve as a \"buffer\" to protect the stream system's ability to\nfulfill its natural functions. Primary natural functions of the buffer include:\nProtect water quality by filtering pollutants;\nProvide storage for floodwaters;\nAllow channels to meander naturally; and\nProvide suitable habitats for wildlife.\n153.002\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Section, the following words and phrases shall be defined as specified\nbelow.\n1. Best Management Practices (BMPs): A structural or nonstructural management-based\npractice used singularly or in combination to reduce non-point source input to receiving\nwaters in order to achieve water quality protection goals.\nNon-structural BMPs: Non-engineered methods to control the amount of non-point\nsource pollution. These may include land-use controls and vegetated buffers.\nStructural BMPs: Engineered structures that are designed to reduce the delivery of\npollutants from their source or to divert contaminants away from the water supply.\nThese may include wet detention ponds, detention basins, grass swales and ditches,\nand infiltration devices, as allowed elsewhere in this Ordinance.\n2. Buffer: A natural or vegetated area through which storm water runoff flows in a diffuse\nmanner so that the runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration\nof the runoff and filtering of pollutants.\n3. Buffer Zones: The stream buffer is comprised of three (3) zones as shown below.\n240\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (5, 1): \n4.

Stream: A drainage feature on the land surface for conveying water.\n8. Top of Bank: The landward edge of the stream channel during high water or bankfull\nconditions at the point where the water begins to overflow onto the floodplain.\n153.003Applicability\n1.

Open space\nSWIM buffer areas can be used toward satisfying all or a portion of the required open\nspace minimums for the development if Town Council determines it is in the best interest\nof the Town.\n153.006 Mitigation\n1. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Section is to set forth the basis on which mitigation is required for\nunavoidable or approved buffer impacts within any of the buffer zones. This mitigation\nbasis shall allow the property owner or other entity the opportunity to disturb a buffer,\nprovided that steps are taken to offset the buffer loss. Prior to any buffer impact, any\nperson or entity seeking approval of a buffer impact shall submit the requisite site and\nmitigation information for review to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services and\napproval by Town Council as specified below, to the extent approval is required by this\nSection.\n2. Buffer impacts not requiring mitigation\nThe following buffer impacts do not require mitigation or specific plan approval but are\nrequired to comply with the specifications provided in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land\nDevelopment Standards Manual for stabilization of disturbed areas to minimize negative\nwater quality impacts.\n(a) Road crossings for connectivity or transportation links where the Pineville Planning\nBoard has granted site plan approval.\n244\n"}, {"page": "245", "text": "(b) Utility crossings.\n(c) Parallel water and sewer utility installation as approved by Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nUtilities.\n(d) Public paths and trails parallel to the stream outside the Stream Side Zone and stream\ncrossings. Pathways must use existing and proposed utility alignments or previously\ncleared areas and minimize tree cutting to the maximum extent practicable. To the\nextent possible, pathways shall preserve existing drainage patterns and avoid\ndrainage structures that concentrate storm water.\n(e) Incidental drainage improvements/repairs for maintenance.\n(f) Individual pedestrian paths connecting homeowners to the stream in the form of\nnarrow, pervious footpaths with minimal tree disturbance.\n(g) New domesticated animal trails (farming) where existing trails are lost as a result of\naction beyond the farmer's control. Stream crossings should be constructed and\nmaintained to minimize impacts to the Stream Side Zone with fencing perpendicular\nand through the buffer to direct animal movement.\n(h) Mitigation approved by a State or federal agency acting pursuant to Sections 401 or\n404 of the federal Clean Water Act.\n3. Buffer impacts requiring mitigation\nImpacts to stream buffers not specified in Section 153.006.2, proposed to allow\ndevelopment or other land use in a buffer, shall be required to mitigate or offset the\nproposed impact in accordance with this Section. Buffer impacts requiring mitigation and\nplan approval include:\n(a) Filling or piping of streams\n(b) Removal of vegetation from the Stream Side or Managed Use Zones other than as\nspecified by Section 153.004.2 \"Vegetative Targets.\"\n(c) Paths proposed within the Stream Side Zone\n(d) Stream relocations\n(e) Fences and walls requiring tree removal in the Stream Side or Managed Use Zones\n(f) Other buffer impacts not permitted under Section 153.004.2.\nThe landowner or other entity proposing any of the impacts specified above shall prepare\nand submit for review a site specific plan to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services\nand for approval by Town Council. This site plan shall show the extent of the proposed\nimpact and clearly specify the proposed mitigation technique.\n4. Pre-approved mitigation techniques\nThe following techniques are available to landowners for mitigation of buffer impacts, upon\nreview and approval of a specific site mitigation plan by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm\n245\n"}, {"page": "246", "text": "Water Services. Specifications for these pre-approved mitigation techniques are provided\nin the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual.\n(a) Installation of Structural BMPs: The installation of an on-site structural BMP designed\nto achieve specified pollutant removal targets will allow for stream buffer impacts on\nthe specific site. The BMP should remain outside the Stream Side Zone if practical. A\ndetailed BMP design plan must be submitted to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water\nServices for approval based on specifications and pollutant removal targets contained\nin the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual or the Pineville\nZoning Ordinance. This plan must also include a long-term maintenance strategy for\nthe BMP complete with the establishment of adequate financing to support the\nproposed maintenance practices.\n(b) Stream Restoration: The owner may restore and preserve the buffer area on any\nstream of equivalent or greater drainage area the condition of which is determined to\nbe qualified for restoration by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services on a 1:1\nbasis in linear feet of stream. This restoration shall include stream bank improvements\nand Stream Side and Managed Use Zone re-vegetation, in accordance with the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual.\n(c) Stream Preservation: The owner may purchase, fee simple, other stream segments at\nequivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1 linear foot basis and convey fee simple\nand absolute title to the land to the City/County or other conservation organization.\n(d) Wetlands Restoration: On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed stream and buffer area (2\nacres of wetland for each acre of disturbed area), the owner may provide a\ncombination of the preservation and/or restoration of wetlands with protective\neasements, and the implementation of structural or non-structural BMPs to achieve\nspecific pollutant removal targets within the impacted area as specified in the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual.\n(e)\nBottom Land Hardwood Preservation: On a 2:1 acreage basis for impacted stream\nand buffer area (2 acres of bottomland hardwood for each acre of disturbed area), the\nowner may provide a combination of the preservation of existing bottom land\nhardwood forest or other specifically approved natural heritage area by conservation\neasement or other legal instrument, and the implementation of structural or\nnon-structural BMPs to achieve specific pollutant removal targets within the impacted\narea as specified in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Land Development Standards Manual.\n(f) Controlled Impervious Cover: The owner may commit to, and provide, a specific site\ndevelopment plan that limits overall site impervious cover equal to or less than 24%.\nDevelopment on this basis shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the specific site.\nPreservation of the Stream Side Zone is encouraged.\n(g) Open Space Development: The submission of a specific site development plan which\npreserves 50% of the total land area as undisturbed open space shall allow for stream\nbuffer impacts on the specific site.\n246\n"}, {"page": "247", "text": "(h) Mitigation Credits: The purchase of mitigation credits on a 1:1 basis utilizing linear feet\nof stream impacted and the prevailing rate of purchase as established by Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Storm Water Services shall allow for stream buffer impacts on the\nspecific site. Mitigation credits purchased under any other program (i.e., U.S. Army\nCorp of Engineers) shall not cover this requirement unless the issuing agency agrees\nto relinquish the funds to the appropriate Town/County agency.\n5. Other mitigation techniques\nNo provision of this Section shall prevent the creative development of alternative mitigation\nplans. The owner shall submit such plan with proposed buffer impacts and detailed\nmitigation information to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services for review and to\nTown Council for approval. The criteria used to judge the acceptability of any alternative\nplan shall be the degree to which the plan addresses the preservation of the four primary\nnatural functions of stream buffers. Such plans may be submitted in conjunction with a\nmitigation plan submission to the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers and N.C. Department of\nEnvironment and Natural Resources for proposed stream or wetland impacts. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Storm Water Services and the Town Council, when considering proposed\nmitigation alternatives, shall give equal weight to proposals that utilize the preservation of\nunique or endangered habitat or natural areas against proposed buffer impacts.\n6. Posting of financial security required for structural BMPs\nWhen structural BMPs (wet detention ponds and other BMPs) are approved for mitigation\nof a buffer disturbance, the approval shall be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or\nletter of credit or making other financial arrangements which are acceptable to Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Storm Water Services, in a form which is satisfactory to the Town Attorney,\nguaranteeing the installation and maintenance of the required structural BMPs until the\nissuance of certificates of occupancy for seventy-five percent (75%) of all construction\nwhich might reasonably be anticipated to be built within the area which drains into the\nBMPs, allowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of the final plat.\nAt such time that this level of occupancy is achieved, written notice thereof must be given\nby the owner to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. The owner must also verify\nthe adequacy of the maintenance plan for the BMPs including the necessary financing to\nsupport the proposed maintenance practices. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water\nServices will inspect the structural BMPs and verify the effectiveness of the maintenance\nplan and if found satisfactory, will within 30 days of the date of the notice notify the owner\nin writing.\n7. Maintenance responsibilities for structural BMPs - Civil Penalties\nMaintenance of all structural BMPs shall be the responsibility of the property owner or his\ndesignee. Any person who fails to maintain the required BMPs in accordance with the\napproved maintenance plan shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500. Each\nday that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. No penalties shall be\n247\n"}, {"page": "248", "text": "assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified in writing of the\nviolation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by other means\nwhich are reasonably calculated to give actual notice.
