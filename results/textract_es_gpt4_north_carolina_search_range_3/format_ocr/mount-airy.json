The R-20\ndistrict also permits associated public and private facilities typically associated with such\ndistricts.\nB.\nR-15 Single-Family Residential District. The R-15 Residential District is established as a\ndistrict in which the principal use of land is for medium-density single-family residential uses\nand associated public and private facilities typically associated with such districts.\nC.\nR-8 Single-Family Residential District. The R-8 Residential District is established as a district\nin which the principal use of land is for single-family residential purposes. The regulations of\nthis district are intended to provide areas for those persons desiring single-family residences.\nD.\nR-6 General Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is established as a district in\nwhich the principal use of land is for single-family, two-family and multi-family residences.\nThe regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those\npersons desiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high-density\nneighborhoods.\nE.\nR-4 Residential and Office District. The R-4 Residential and Office District is established to\nprovide for the high density residential, office, governmental and institutional needs of the\ncommunity. It functions as a transitional land use between intensive commercial and\nindustrial uses, and residential development. The district is also designed to encourage\ncompatible uses along major thoroughfares adjacent to residential neighborhoods.\nF.\nB-1 Central Business District. This district is the central shopping area of the City of Mount\nAiry and its surrounding commercial trade area. The regulations of this district are designed\nto encourage the continued use of land for community trade and commercial service uses\nand to promote a concentrated development of permitted uses while maintaining a\nsubstantial relationship between the intensity of land uses and the capacity of utilities and\nstreets.\nG.\nB-2 General Business District. This district provides a location for those businesses and\nservices, which generally serve a wider area than the neighborhood business, but do not\nnecessarily require location in the central business district. Because these commercial uses\nare important to the economy of the area and are subject to public view, they should have\nample parking, controlled traffic movement, and suitable site design.\nH.\nB-3 Neighborhood Business District. The B-3 Neighborhood Business District is intended for\nthe use of those businesses which are properly and necessarily located near residential areas\nand cater to the everyday needs of a residential neighborhood.\nI.\nB-4 Highway Business District. The B-4 Highway Business Districts are generally located on\nmajor thoroughfares and collector streets in the Mount Airy planning area. Because these\nbusiness areas are subject to public view, they should provide an appropriate appearance,\nample parking, and be designed to minimize traffic congestion.\nJ.\nB-5 Medical Business District. The regulations for this district are designed to permit\nconcentrated development of business and professional office facilities within the\njurisdiction and to encourage development that is both compatible with nearby residential\nareas and not hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\nK.\nM-1 Industrial District. The M-1 Industrial District is established for those areas of the\ncommunity where the principal use of land is for industrial and warehousing uses. These\nuses, by their nature, may create some nuisance and are not properly associated with\nresidential, commercial or service establishments.

Conditional District zoning affords a\ndegree of certainty when making land use decisions that are not possible when rezoning to a general\nzoning district, which allows the full range of uses permitted in the district and does not provide the\nflexibility to propose or require binding site-specific conditions to address unique issues that affect the\nsubject property or any potential adverse impacts on adjacent property.\nCreated: 2024-05-20 14:11:47 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 31)\nPage 38 of 250\nCELL (1, 1): \nR-20 CD\nCELL (1, 2): \nR-15 CD\nCELL (1, 3): \nR-8 CD\nCELL (1, 4): \nR-6 CD\nCELL (1, 5): \nR-4 CD\nCELL (1, 6): \nB-1 CD\nCELL (2, 1): \nB-2 CD\nCELL (2, 2): \nB-3 CD\nCELL (2, 3): \nB-4 CD\nCELL (2, 4): \nB-5 CD\nCELL (2, 5): \nM-1 CD\nCELL (2, 6): \n"}, {"page": "39", "text": "4.3. Overlay Districts Established; Purposes Set Forth.\nThe Primary Zoning Districts established in Section 4.1 and the Conditional Districts established in\nSection 4.2 may be subject to the additional requirements of one or more Overlay Districts as\nestablished herein.\nA.\nFlood Damage Prevention Overlay District. The flood hazard areas of the jurisdiction are\nsubject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life, property, health and safety\nhazards, disruption of commerce and government services, extraordinary public\nexpenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which\nadversely affect public health, safety, and general welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses\nvulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood\nproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.\nIt is the purpose of this Overlay District to promote public health, safety, and general\nwelfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by\nprovisions designed to:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to\nwater erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood\nheights or velocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3.\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n4.\nControl filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion\nor flood damage; and\n5.\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert\nfloodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nThe Flood Damage Prevention Overlay District is established as the Floodway and Floodway Fringe\nareas of the various watercourses within the jurisdiction as identified by the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) on its latest flood maps with accompanying supporting data, which\nare hereby adopted by reference.\nB.\nWater Supply Watershed Protection Overlay District. The Water Supply Watershed Protection\nOverlay Districts are intended to help preserve and maintain the City's outstanding water\nresources. They are established to protect those portions of designated water supply\nwatersheds which lie closest to existing and proposed water supply intakes from activities\nwhich could degrade water quality; to reduce the amount of sediment washing into streams;\nto encourage a low intensity of land development in the most sensitive portions of the\nwatershed; to reduce the risk to water quality posed by high density residential and non-\nresidential developments; and for the purpose of protecting and promoting public health,\nsafety, and the general welfare of the jurisdiction.\nThe following Watershed Protection Overlay District classifications are established and are\nshown on the Watershed Protection Overlay District Map, which is hereby adopted and\nincorporated into this Ordinance.\nArarat River Watershed Critical Area (ARWS-CA)-WS-III-CA*\nArarat River Watershed Protected Area (ARWS-PA)-WS-IV-PA*\nLovills Creek Watershed Critical Area (LCWS-CA)-WS-IV-CA*\nLovills Creek Watershed Protected Area (LCWS-PA)-WS-IV-PA*\nStewarts Creek Watershed Critical Area (SCWS-CA)-WS-IV-CA*\nCreated: 2024-05-20 14:11:47 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 31)\nPage 39 of 250\n"}, {"page": "40", "text": "Stewarts Creek Watershed Protected Area (SCWS-PA)-WS-IV-PA*\n*\nWater Supply Watershed classification as assigned to the Water Supply Watershed by the North\nCarolina Environmental Management Commission pursuant to North Carolina General\nStatutes 143-214.5.\nC.\nHistoric Landmarks and Preservation Overlay District.

General Provisions.\nA.\nPurpose. These sign regulations are adopted under the zoning authority of the City of Mount Airy\nin furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in this Article. The purpose of these sign\nregulations are:\n1.\nTo encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication while preserving the\nrights of free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n2.\nTo maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the City's ability to attract sources\nof economic development and growth;\n3.\nTo enhance the viability of local commerce with effective, fair and reasonable sign\nrestrictions;\n4.\nTo improve pedestrian and traffic safety;\n5.\nTo minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; and\n6.\nTo enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions.\nB.\nApplicability. A sign may be constructed, erected, placed, established, painted, created, or\nmaintained in the City's zoning jurisdiction only in conformance with the standards, procedures,\nexemptions, and other requirements of this Article. The effect of this Article as more specifically\nset forth herein is:\n1.\nTo establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial and industrial\nzones, and a limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards and the permit\nprocedures of this Article;\n2.\nTo allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the\nrespective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this\nArticle, but without a requirement for permits;\n3.\nTo prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Article; and\n4.\nTo provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this Article.\nC.\nAlteration of Signs.

The area of a sign face shall be computed by\nmeans of the smallest square or rectangle, that will encompass the extreme limits of the\nwriting, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color\nforming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign\nfrom the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting\nframework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets\nzoning Ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.\n2.\nComputation of Area of Multi-Faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one (1)\nface shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one\npoint. When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back-to-back, so that both faces cannot\nbe viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same\nsign structure and not more than forty-two (42\") inches apart, the sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces.\nFigure 9-1-Measurement of a Sign Face\nCreated: 2024-05-20 14:11:49 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 31)\nPage 142 of 250\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "SIGN\nWidth\n3.\nComputation of Height.
