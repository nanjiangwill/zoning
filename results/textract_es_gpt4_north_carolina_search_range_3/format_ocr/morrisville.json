Purpose\nThe Transit-Oriented Development District provides for transit-supportive development types\nand intensities within convenient walking distance of a transit station. The district is intended\nto create a vibrant, well-designed center of activity, expand transportation choices, provide\nworkforce housing, and promote economic development. The district is also intended to\naccommodate compact and pedestrian-friendly development that: Includes a well-integrated\nmix of complementary high-activity uses, including transit-supportive commercial, residential,\ncivic, and employment uses; Provides multiple, direct, and safe vehicular, bicycle, and\npedestrian connections between the transit station and the surrounding uses, with sufficient-\nbut not excessive-parking to accommodate transit users and district visitors and residents;\nIncludes distinctive, attractive, and engaging public spaces that help create a sense of place\nfor the station area; Includes a range of housing choices for households of different incomes;\nand Is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. All development shall have a mix of uses,\nincluding uses from at least two of the following three groups as found in the Principal Use\nTable: Residential, Institutional, or Commercial. All buildings fronting a street must dedicate\nfifty (50) percent of the total length of the ground floor facing said streets for uses allowed\nin the TOD District and identified in the Principal Use Table's Use Category as Health Care,\nEating and Drinking Establishment, Entertainment, Retail Sales and Service, or Visitor\nAccommodation.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS\n3.7.1. General\nA. General Purposes of Planned Development Districts\nThe Planned Development (PD) districts are established and intended to encourage innovative land\nplanning and site design concepts that support a high quality of life and achieve a high quality of\ndevelopment, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other Town goals and objectives by:\n1.\nReducing or diminishing the inflexibility or uniform design that sometimes results from strict\napplication of zoning and development standards designed primarily for individual lots;\n2.\nAllowing greater freedom in selecting the means of providing access, open space, and design\namenities;\n3.\nAllowing greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and nonresidential land\nuses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities;\n4.\nAllowing more efficient use of land, with smaller networks of streets and utilities, and thereby\nlowering development and housing costs; and\n5. Promoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development that respects surrounding\nestablished land use character and respects and takes advantage of a site's natural and man-\nmade features, such as trees, wetlands, floodplains, and historic features.\nB. Classification of Planned Development Districts\nLand shall be classified into a PD district only in accordance with the procedures and requirements set\nforth in Section 2.5.3, Rezoning, and this section.\nC.

Findings and Purpose\n1.\nThe flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town are subject to periodic inundation. The\ncumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains cause increases in flood heights and velocities and\nthe occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods increase the likelihood of loss of\nlife, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,\nextraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,\nall of which could adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\n2.\nThe purpose of the Floodplain Overlay District is to minimize these risks and losses by provisions\ndesigned to:\na. Protect human life and health;\nb. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\nC.\nMinimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\nd. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\ne.\nMinimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone,\ncable and sewer lines, streets and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\nf.\nHelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nprone areas; and\ng. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area or\nFuture Conditions Flood Hazard Area.\nB. Applicability\n1.\nThe Floodplain Overlay (FO) District applies to all land within any Special Flood Hazard Area or\na Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction\nof the Town of Morrisville. Special Flood Hazard Areas and Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas\nshall be as determined under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement between the State\nof North Carolina and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) using the most recent\nversion of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Wake County and associated DFIRM panels, which\nare adopted by reference as part of this Ordinance. Future revisions to the FIS or DFIRM panels\nthat do not change flood hazard data within the jurisdiction of Morrisville are also adopted by\nreference as part of this Ordinance.\nMorrisville, NC\nJune 13, 2023\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 3-58\n"}, {"page": "161", "text": "2.\nWithin the Floodplain Overlay (FO) District, no structure shall be located, extended, converted, or\naltered, and no development activity shall occur, in any way except after approval of a Floodplain\nDevelopment Permit in accordance with 2.5.9, Floodplain Development Permit, and in full\ncompliance with the provisions of Section 5.6, Floodplain Management.\n3.\nThe degree of flood protection required by the Floodplain Overlay District is considered\nreasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration.\nLarger floods can and will occur.

Findings and Purpose\nThe Gateway Overlay (GO) District was designed to implement the Morrisville Land Use Plan. To that\nend, the Town of Morrisville has found it necessary to enact additional code language that addresses\nspecific design considerations.\nProperties located in this area have been placed in the Gateway Overlay District, which regulates the\nform and arrangement of all development. These regulations have been designed to enhance any\nunderlying base Zoning District by complementing a variety of uses with high-quality, pedestrian-friendly\ndesign. In order to better manage the wide array of possible underlying uses, a set of development\nguidelines has been established to regulate buildings and their relationship to public streets and open\nspace.\nB. Applicability\n1. The regulations found in this section shall apply to the Gateway Overlay (GO) District.\n2. The Gateway Overlay (GO) District is intended only for properties adjacent to or in close\nproximity of major thoroughfares.\n3.

ORGANIZATION\nSection 4.2, Principal Uses, identifies land uses allowed as the principal uses in the various zoning districts\nand sets out the special standards that apply to a number of the allowable principal uses. Section 4.3,\nAccessory Uses and Structures, identifies land uses and structures commonly allowed as accessory to principal\nuses, sets out general standards applicable to all accessory uses and structures, and sets out special standards\nthat apply to particular accessory uses and structures. Section 4.4, Temporary Uses and Structures, identifies\nland uses or structures allowed on a temporary basis, sets out general standards applicable to all temporary\nuses and structures, and sets out special standards that apply to particular temporary uses and structures.\nSECTION 4.2. PRINCIPAL USES\n4.2.1. Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to authorize the establishment and continuation of land uses that are allowed\nas the primary use(s) of a parcel-i.e., principal uses. This section identifies the zoning districts in which such\nprincipal uses are allowed, identifies what type of permit or review is required to establish them, and\nsets\nout any special standards applicable to particular principal uses. This section is also intended to establish a\nhierarchy for organizing principal uses that reflects functional relationships among the various principal uses\nand that in conjunction with Section 11.3, Use Classifications and Interpretation, makes it easier to determine\nwhether a particular proposed use is allowable as a principal use in a particular zoning district.\n4.2.2.\nOrganization and Applicability\nSection 4.2.3, Classification of Principal Uses, identifies the hierarchy of use classifications, use categories,\nand use types by which principal uses are organized in this section's Principal Use Table and use-specific\nstandards. Section 4.2.4, Principal Use Table, contains a table listing allowable principal uses and showing\nwhether each use is permitted or prohibited within the various zoning districts, as well as the type of permit\nor approval by which the use may be allowed. Section 4.2.5, Principal Use-Specific Standards, sets forth\nstandards applicable to specific principal uses regardless of the zoning district in which they are allowed or\nthe review procedure by which they are approved, unless expressly stated to the contrary. These standards\nmay be modified by other applicable requirements in this Ordinance.\n4.2.3.\nClassification of Principal Uses\nA. The following hierarchy of use classifications, use categories, and use types is used to organize allowable\nuses listed in Section 4.2.4, Principal Use Table, and the use-specific standards set out in Section 4.2.5,\nPrincipal Use-Specific Standards, Descriptions of this classification system and hierarchy are contained\nin Section 11.3, Use Classifications and Interpretation.\n1.\nUse Classifications\nUse Classifications are very broad and general (e.g., Agricultural Uses, Residential Uses,\nInstitutional Uses, Commercial Uses, and Industrial Uses).\n2.\nUse Categories\nUse Categories represent major subgroups of the use classifications that have common functional,\nproduct, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, type of occupants or\nusers/customers, or operational characteristics. For example, the Commercial Use Classification is\ndivided into multiple use categories, including Eating or Drinking Uses and Visitor Accommodation\nUses.\nMorrisville, NC\nJune 13, 2023\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 4-1\n"}, {"page": "167", "text": "Article 4: Use Standards\nSection 4.2. Principal Uses\n4.2.4. Principal Use Table\n3. Use Types\nUse Types identify specific principal land uses whose characteristics are considered to fall within\nthe various use categories. For example, bars, lounges, brewpubs, and restaurants are use types\nwithin the Eating and Drinking Use Category. Each use type is defined in Section 11.5, Terms and\nUses Defined. While the Residential and Institutional use classifications tend to include relatively\nspecific and well-defined use types, the Commercial and Industrial use classifications tend to include\nbroader uses types, reflecting the wider range and ever-growing variety of commercial and\nindustrial uses existing in the community.\nB. Classifying principal uses in this manner provides a systematic basis for determining whether a particular\nland use not expressly listed should be considered a form or example of a listed principal use, and for\naddressing future additions to the Principal Use Tables.

This section\nalso identifies the zoning districts in which such accessory uses and structures are allowed, identifies what\ntype of permit or review is required to establish them, sets out general standards applicable to all accessory\nuses and structures, and sets out any special standards applicable to particular accessory uses and structures.\nThis section is intended to allow a broad range of accessory uses and structures, SO long as they are located\non the same site as the principal use and comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce\npotentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands.\nThe purpose of the mural installation is to activate and enhance the connectivity and vitality of the Town\nthrough engaging artwork and creative placemaking, while providing an opportunity for community\nengagements through the creation of murals that are colorful and inspiring for residents and visitors. These\nmurals should reflect the unique characteristics of Morrisville.\n4.3.2.\nOrganization and Applicability\nSection 4.3.3, General Standards for All Accessory Uses and Structures, establishes general standards that\napply\nto all allowed accessory uses and structures. Section 4.3.4, Accessory Use/Structure Table, shows\nwhether a particular type of accessory use or structure is permitted or prohibited within the various zoning\ndistricts. It is not intended to limit allowable accessory uses and structures to those listed in the Accessory\nUse/Structure Table. Section 4.3.5, Accessory Use-Specific Standards, sets forth standards for all accessory\nuses and structures for which a reference to this section is provided in the \"Use-Specific Standards\" column\nof the Accessory Use/Structure Table for a particular type of accessory use or structure regardless of the\nzoning district in which they are allowed or the review procedure by which they are approved, unless\nexpressly stated to the contrary.

Relationship to Principal Use or Structure\n1.\nExcept as otherwise expressly allowed in this Ordinance, an accessory use or structure shall not be\nestablished or constructed before the establishment or construction of the principal use or structure.\n2.\nIf the principal use or structure is destroyed or removed, the accessory use or structure shall no\nlonger be allowed.\n3. Except as otherwise expressly allowed in this Ordinance, the total floor area of non-habitable\naccessory structures to a residential use shall not exceed 50 percent of the heated floor area of\nthe principal structure(s) on the lot. See Section 4.3.5.B.1, Accessory Apartment for habitable\naccessory structure standards.\n4.\nExcept where otherwise expressly allowed in this Ordinance, the total floor area of buildings\naccessory to a nonresidential use shall not exceed the lesser of 2,000 square feet or 10 percent\nof the floor area of the principal building(s) on the lot.\nB.

PURPOSE\nThe purpose of the standards in this section is to protect water quality in the Upper Neuse River Basin and\nthe Jordan Lake watershed, including water supplies throughout the Neuse River Basin and Jordan Lake\nwatershed. Specifically, it is intended to protect and preserve existing riparian buffers in accordance with\nState riparian buffer rules. Vegetative buffers adjacent to surface waters provide multiple environmental\nprotection and resource management benefits. Forested buffers enhance and protect the natural ecology of\nstream systems, as well as water quality through bank stabilization, shading, and nutrient removal. They also\nhelp minimize flood damage in flood prone areas. Well-vegetated riparian buffers help remove nitrogen\nand prevent sediment and sediment-bound pollutants such as phosphorus from reaching the waters. The\nriparian buffer standards in this article are intended to achieve these important benefits.\nSECTION 6.2. GENERAL\n6.2.1. Authority\nThis article is enacted and administered pursuant to the Town's general authority to regulate development\n(see Section 1.1.2, Authority) and the local delegation or assignment of authority for the protection and\nmaintenance of riparian buffers granted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission in\naccordance with 15A NCAC 2B .0241 (Neuse River Basin: Nutrient Sensitive Waters Management Strategy:\nDelegation of Authority for the Protection And Maintenance of Riparian Buffers) and 15A NCAC 02B .0267\n(Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Protection of Existing Riparian Buffers).\n6.2.2.\nApplicability\nA.

GENERAL PROVISIONS\n7.1.1.\nFindings\nA. It is hereby determined that:\n1.\nDevelopment and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases\nstormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and\npoint source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater\nrecharge;\n2.\nThese changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants\nand alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural\nenvironment; and\n3.\nThese effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned\ncontrols to manage stormwater runoff from development and redevelopment sites.\nB. It is further determined that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (\"Clean Water Act\") and\nfederal Phase Il Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina\nEnvironmental Management Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase Il requirements,\ncompel certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as\nthose included in this Ordinance.\nC. Additionally, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission has identified B. Everett Jordan\nreservoir, a water supply reservoir, as nutrient sensitive waters; has identified all or a portion of the\nreservoir as impaired waters under the federal Clean Water Act due to exceedances of the chlorophyll\na standard; and has promulgated rules that have been amended and affirmed by the North Carolina\nGeneral Assembly (the \"Jordan Rules\") to reduce the average annual loads of nitrogen and phosphorus\ndelivered to Jordan Reservoir from all point and nonpoint sources of these nutrients located within its\nwatershed, including stormwater from new development in this jurisdiction;\nD. Therefore, the Morrisville Town Council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to\nmeet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge\nfor development and redevelopment.\n7.1.2.\nPurpose\nA. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment, and\ngeneral welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of:\nincreased post-development stormwater runoff, nitrogen; phosphorus, and total suspended solids in\nstormwater runoff; nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and\nredevelopment; and illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems. It has been determined that\nproper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater runoff will: minimize\ndamage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare; and protect water and aquatic resources.\nB. This article seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means:\n1.\nEstablishing decision-making processes for development and redevelopment that protects the\nintegrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources;\n2. Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic\nresponse in their post-development state for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding,\nstreambank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and increases in stream temperature, and\nto maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;\nMorrisville, NC\nJune 13, 2023\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 7-1\n"}, {"page": "429", "text": "Article 7: Stormwater Management\nSection 7.1.

USE CLASSIFICATIONS AND INTERPRETATION\n11.3.1. Principal Use Classification System\nA. Purpose\nThis section is intended to provide a systematic framework for identifying, describing, categorizing,\nconsolidating, and distinguishing land uses in a way that makes it easier to determine whether a\nparticular use, activity, or combination of activities is allowable as a principal use in a particular zoning\ndistrict in accordance with the use tables in Article 4: Use Standards, or is subject to other use-specific\nprovisions in this Ordinance. This section is also intended to guide interpretations of how a particular\nunlisted use should be categorized and to address future additions to the use tables.\nB. Structure of Principal Use Classification System\nThe principal use classification system described in this section groups uses into three levels: use\nclassifications, use categories, and use types.\n1.\nUse Classifications\nThe use classifications identify broad general classifications of land use and include agricultural\nand extraction uses, residential uses, institutional uses, commercial uses, and industrial uses. Use\nclassifications are further broken down into a series of general \"use categories.\"\n2.\nUse Categories\na. The use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications, and are\nbased on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount\nof activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and\nsite conditions. For example, the Residential Uses Classification is divided into the Household\nLiving and Group Living use categories.\nb. Each use category is described in terms of the common characteristics of included uses (including\ncommon or typical accessory uses), examples of common use types included in the category,\nMorrisville, NC\nJune 13, 2023\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 11-3\n"}, {"page": "480", "text": "Article 11: Interpretation and Definitions\nSection 11.3. Use Classifications and Interpretation\n11.3.1. Principal Use Classification System\nand, for a number of use categories, exceptions-i.e., those uses that might appear to fall\nwithin the use category, but are included in another use category.\n3.\nUse Types\nThe specific use types included in each use category identify specific principal uses that are\nconsidered to possess the characteristics identified for the use category. For example, single-family\ndetached dwellings, duplex dwellings, single-family attached dwellings, multifamily dwellings,\nand\nmanufactured home dwellings are use types in the Household Living use category.\nC. Development with Multiple Principal Use Types\nA development may include multiple principal uses, provided each principal use is a principal use type\nallowed in the applicable zoning district and the development complies with any use-specific standards\napplicable to each of the included use types. If a use within a development is determined to be an\naccessory use to a principal use in the development, such accessory use shall be subject to the accessory\nuse standards in Section 4.3, Accessory Uses and Structures.\nD. Agricultural and Animal Related Uses Classification\n1.\nAgriculture Uses\nThe Agriculture Uses category is characterized by activities related to the production of field crops,\nfruits, vegetables, ornamental and flowering plants, and the breeding, raising, or keeping of\nlivestock, poultry, swine, or other animals for food or other marketable products. The Agriculture\nUses category also includes silvicultural activities related to the planting, management, protection,\nand harvesting of trees for timber or other forest products. Example use types include farms,\nforestry, and greenhouse and nursery production. Also included are garden centers, and community\ngardens. This use category does not include the processing of animal or plant products for\nwholesale or retail sale purposes, which is generally considered an industrial manufacturing use\ntype. Accessory uses may include offices, storage areas, barns, irrigation systems, and repair\nfacilities related to the agricultural activities.\n2.\nAnimal Related Uses\nThe Animal Related Uses category includes use types that provide services, general care, and\nboarding services for domestic animals. Example use types include stables, kennels, and veterinary\nclinics. Accessory uses may include offices, storage areas, stables, outdoor exercise pens or runs,\nand limited retail sales.\nE. Residential Uses Classification\n1.\nHousehold Living Uses\nThe Household Living Uses category includes use types providing for the residential occupancy of\na dwelling unit by a single family. Tenancy is generally arranged on a month-to-month or longer\nbasis. Example use types include single-family detached dwellings, duplex dwellings, single-family\nattached dwellings, multifamily dwellings, bungalow court, pocket neighborhood, and\nmanufactured home dwellings. In accordance with State law, dwelling units providing a single\nhousekeeping environment for groups of six or fewer persons with physical, emotional, or mental\ndisabilities are treated as any other household living use, and not as a group living use. This use\ncategory does not include residential use types that generally involve some level of managed\npersonal care for a larger number of residents (e.g., congregate living facilities), which are\ncategorized as group living uses. It also does not include use types where persons generally occupy\nliving units for periods of less than 30 days (e.g., hotel/motel), which are categorized as visitor\naccommodation uses. Accessory uses common to household living uses include recreational activities,\nraising of domestic pets, hobbies, swimming pools, and parking of the occupants' vehicles. Some\naccessory uses (e.g., home occupations and accessory dwelling units) are subject to additional\nregulations (see Section 4.3, Accessory Uses and Structures).\nMorrisville, NC\nJune 13, 2023\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 11-4\n"}, {"page": "481", "text": "Article 11: Interpretation and Definitions\nSection 11.3. Use Classifications and Interpretation\n11.3.1. Principal Use Classification System\n2.\nGroup Living Uses\nThe Group Living Uses category includes use types providing for the residential occupancy of a\ngroup of living units by persons who do not constitute a single family and may receive some level\nof personal care. Individual living units often consist of a single room or group of rooms without\ncooking and eating facilities, but unlike a hotel/motel, are generally occupied on a monthly or\nlonger basis. Example use types include congregate living facilities, and rooming houses. Although\ncontinuing care retirement communities include household living uses (e.g., dwellings) and health\ncare uses (e.g., nursing homes), they are categorized as a group living use because of their focus\non the present or future provision of personal care to senior citizens and their integration of various\nuses as a single cohesive development. This use category does not include use types where persons\ngenerally occupy living units for periods of less than 30 days (e.g., hotel/motels), which are\ncategorized as visitor accommodation uses. It also does not include use types where residents or\ninpatients are routinely provided more than minor health care services (e.g., nursing homes), which\nare categorized as health care uses. Accessory uses common to group living uses include\nrecreational facilities, administrative offices, and food preparation and dining facilities.\nF. Institutional Uses Classification\n1.\nCommunity and Government Service Uses\nThe Community and Government Service Uses category includes use types of a public, nonprofit,\nor charitable nature providing a local service (e.g., cultural, recreational, counseling, education,\ntraining, religious) directly to people of the community. Generally, such uses provide ongoing\ncontinued service on-site or have employees at the site on a regular basis. The category does not\ninclude uses with a residential component. Example use types include clubs or lodges of community-\noriented associations, colleges and universities, community centers, day care centers, emergency\nservices, administrative government services, government maintenance/storage/distribution\nfacilities, places of worship, public cultural facilities (e.g. libraries, museums), public parks and\nrecreation facilities, and schools. This use category does not include private or commercial health\nclubs or recreational facilities (categorized as recreation/entertainment uses), or counseling in an\noffice setting (categorized as an office use), or passenger terminals for public transportation\nservices, park and ride terminals, or water, wastewater, gas, electric, or other infrastructure services\n(categorized as transportation, communication, and utility uses).

Procedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses\nThe Planning Director may interpret a particular principal use or accessory use or structure not expressly\nlisted in Article 4: Use Standards, as allowed in a particular zoning district-as a permitted principal\nuse, a Special Use, or a permitted accessory use or structure-based on the standards in subsection B\nor C below, as appropriate.\nB. Criteria for Allowing Unlisted Principal Uses\nThe Planning Director shall interpret an unlisted principal use as an allowed permitted use or a Special\nUse in a particular zoning district only after finding that the nature, function, and duration of the use and\nthe impact of allowing it in the zoning district are so similar to those of a use type or use category that\nis allowed in the zoning district that the unlisted use should be deemed allowed in the same manner (i.e.,\nas a permitted use or a Special Use) as the similar use type or use category and subject to the same\nuse-specific standards. In making such interpretation, the Planning Director shall consider the relevant\ncharacteristics of the unlisted use relevant to the those of listed and defined use types and/or of the use\ncategories described in this section, the purpose and intent statements in this Ordinance concerning the\nzoning district (Article 3: Zoning Districts), and the character of use types allowable in the district. The\nrelevant characteristics of the unlisted use that should be considered in making this interpretation include,\nbut are not limited to, the following:\n1.\nActual or projected characteristics of each activity likely to occur at the unlisted use;\n2.\nThe type, size, orientation, and nature of buildings, and structures devoted to each activity;\nMorrisville, NC\nJune 13, 2023\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 11-8\n"}, {"page": "485", "text": "Article 11: Interpretation and Definitions\nSection 11.3.

The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited to\nnoise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes;\n11. Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use type, including but not limited\nto water supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or\nrecommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and\n12. The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type, which should not be greater than\nthat of other use types allowed in the zoning district.\nC. Criteria for Allowing Unlisted Accessory Uses and Structures\nThe Planning Director shall interpret an unlisted use or structure as an allowable accessory use or structure\nto a principal use allowed in a particular zoning district only after finding that:\n1.\nThe use or structure is accessory to the principal use, in accordance with the definitions of \"accessory\nuse\" and \"accessory structure\" in Section 11.5, Terms and Uses Defined, and the example accessory\nuses listed in Section 11.5's definition of the principal use or in this section's description of the\nrelevant use category;\n2.\nThe nature, function, and potential impacts of the use or structure are SO similar to those of uses or\nstructures that are accessory to the principal use, or of accessory uses allowable in the zoning\ndistrict, that the unlisted use or structure should be deemed allowable in the same manner as the\nsimilar accessory uses or structures;\n3.\nThe use or structure is compatible with the character of principal and accessory uses allowable in\nthe district; and\n4.\nAllowing the use or structure as an accessory use or structure is consistent with the purpose and\nintent statements in this Ordinance concerning the zoning district (see Article 3: Zoning Districts).\nD. Effect of Allowing Unlisted Uses as Permitted Use or Special Use\nOn interpreting an unlisted use or structure as allowed in a zoning district, and finding that the use or\nstructure is likely to be common or would lead to confusion if it remains unlisted, the Planning Director\nmay initiate an application for a text amendment to this Ordinance in accordance with Section 2.5.2,\nText Amendment, to list the use or structure in Article 4 as a permitted principal use, a Special Use, or a\npermitted accessory use or structure, as appropriate. Until final action is taken on the text amendment\napplication, the interpretation of the Planning Director shall be binding.\nMorrisville, NC\nJune 13, 2023\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 11-9\n"}, {"page": "486", "text": "Article 11: Interpretation and Definitions\nSection 11.4.
