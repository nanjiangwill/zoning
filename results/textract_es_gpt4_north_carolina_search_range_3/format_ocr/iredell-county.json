Where the applicant for rezoning desires\nproperty to be rezoned to such a district in such situations, the Conditional Zoning\nDistrict is a means by which such special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance\nof the purpose of this Ordinance. The Conditional Zoning District classification will be\nconsidered for rezoning only upon request of a property owner or authorized agent.\nTherefore, the following Conditional Zoning Districts (CD) which correspond to each of\nthe districts authorized by this ordinance are established: AC-CD, RA-CD, RU-R-CD, R-R-\nCD, R-20-CD, R-12-CD, R-8-CD, R-O-CD, O-I-CD, N-B-CD, H-B-CD, G-B-CD, M-1-CD, M-2-\nCD, and CB-CD.\nSection 2.18.2 Uses\nWithin a CD, only those uses authorized as permitted uses in the zoning district with\nwhich the CD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the\ncorresponding district shall be met as minimum standards. The CB-CD districts that were\napproved prior to the adoption of this ordinance shall comply with the HB district uses\nunless otherwise stated in the conditions. All Conditional Use Districts approved prior to\nJanuary 15, 2008 shall hereby be replaced by a comparable Conditional District. For\ninstance, a pre-existing GB-CUD designation will be changed to a GB-CD designation,\nincluding any associated conditions. All conditions and approvals shall continue to\napply; however, changes to that district shall be handled through the conditional\ndistrict process. Nothing in this section should be interpreted to invalidate any CUD or\nCD which was legally adopted.\nSection 2.19 Overlay Districts\nSection 2.19.1 Purpose\nOverlay districts are created to provide additional development standards for specially\nidentified areas. Overlay districts combine with the regulatory provisions of the\nunderlying base zoning district to provide additional or supplementary standards. The\nfollowing overlay districts are created for this purpose:\nA. Airport Overlay\nThe Airport Overlay is designed to protect approach zones for the Statesville\nRegional Airport from structures and landscaping whose height may be detrimental\nto incoming and outgoing flights.\nB. Floodplain Overlay\nThe purpose of Floodplain Overlay is to promote public health, safety, and general\nwelfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within\nflood prone areas by provisions designed to: restrict or prohibit uses that are\ndangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that\nIredell County Land Development Code\n2-36\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; require that uses\nvulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against\nflood damage at the time of initial construction; control the alteration of natural\nfloodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in\nthe accommodation of floodwaters; control filling, grading, dredging, and all other\ndevelopment that may increase erosion or flood damage; and prevent or regulate\nthe construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which\nmay increase flood hazards to other lands.\nC. Municipal Growth Overlay\nThe Municipal Growth Overlay has been developed to accommodate\ndevelopment that is located within the County's zoning jurisdiction but will likely be\ndeveloped under one of the local municipality's regulations. This development\npattern will likely be predicated by the fact that annexation may occur in the future\nor that municipal utilities are, or soon will be, available and is meant to create a\n\"seamless\" development pattern between urban and rural uses.\nD. Watershed Overlay\nThe Watershed Overlay is intended to protect local water sources from any activity\nthat would pose a threat to water quality. This is done by limiting lot sizes for single-\nfamily uses, limiting hard surface or impervious area for all other uses, and buffering\nwater sources to protect from pollutants.\nDevelopment regulations for each overlay district can be found in Chapter 4.\n(amended 9/18/18, TA-2018-01)\nSection 2.20 Permitted Uses\nSection 2.20.1 Purpose\nThe Table of Permitted and Special Uses which follows contains a listing of uses which\nmay be permitted in one or more of the various Zoning Districts established by this\nOrdinance. Uses are listed in alphabetical order in five functional categories. The\ncategories in the order of listing are:\nAgricultural and Residential Uses\nRecreational, Educational and Institutional Uses\nCommercial Uses\nManufacturing and Industrial Uses\nPublic Works Facilities, Utilities and Infrastructure\nSection 2.20.2 Entries\nThe District or Districts in which a particular listed use may be permitted is indicated by\nan \"X\", \"R\", or \"S\" in the District column(s) opposite the listed use.\nSection 2.20.3 Meaning of Entries\nThe meaning of the entries in the Table are as follows:\nA. \"X\" indicates the use is permitted by right and a zoning permit may be obtained.\nIredell County Land Development Code\n2-37\n"}, {"page": "58", "text": "B. \"R\" indicates that a use is permitted but has additional Performance Requirements\nthat the use must meet. The column on the far right labeled \"R\" indicates the\nnumber associated with the Performance Requirement. These requirements are\ncontained in Chapter 3.\nC. \"S\" indicates the use requires approval of a Special Use Permit in accordance with\nthe procedures in Section 12.2.4. All of these uses have additional Performance\nRequirements which are identified in the column on the far right labeled \"R\". The\nPerformance Requirement shall represent the minimum conditions for issuance of a\nSpecial Use Permit.\nD. The listing of a use in the Table of Permitted Uses and Special Uses in no way relieves\nthat use of having to meet all local, State and Federal laws pertaining to the\nestablishment and operation of that use.\nSection 2.20.4 Determining Permitted Uses, Principal Uses and Mixed Uses\nThe listings of Permitted Uses in the various Districts in this Ordinance are considered to\nbe specific in regard to the types of uses intended for each of the various Districts. In\ndetermining proposed uses, the Zoning Administrator shall refer to the latest edition of\nthe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). When a proposed use is NOT\nspecifically listed in the Table of Permitted Uses, the Zoning Administrator shall use NAICS\nto determine if the use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use in form and\nfunction. If the Zoning Administrator finds that the proposed use is the same as, or\nmanifestly similar to, a listed use, he shall classify the proposed use as the listed use. If\nthe Zoning Administrator finds that a proposed use is NOT the same as, or is NOT\nmanifestly similar to, a listed use, he shall classify the proposed use as NOT permitted. In\neach case, the Zoning Administrator shall maintain a written record of such\ndeterminations.\nIn determining what is a principal use, the principal use shall be considered as the\nprimary purpose or function that a lot or structure serves or is proposed to serve. An\naccessory use shall be considered a structure or use that:\nA. Is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with a principal building\nor use;\nB. Is subordinate to and serves a principal building or a principal use;\nC. Is subordinate in area, extent, or purpose to the principal building or principal use\nserved;\nD. Contributes to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of occupants, business, or\nindustry in the principal building or principal use served; and\nE. Is located on the same lot and zoned the same as the principal building or use\nserved.\nIredell County Land Development Code\n2-38\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "Two or more principal uses may, in some

Purpose\nThis section is used to specifically address certain land uses and provide requirements\non an individual basis for certain uses. With certain land uses there is the need to have\na set of requirements to govern that particular type of use. This section standardizes\nthe requirements that a use must meet and groups these uses based on similarities.\nSection 3.1.1 Notes to the Table of Permitted and Special Uses\nThe Table of Permitted and Special Uses in Chapter 2 contains a column on the far right\nlabeled \"R\" for Performance Requirements.

These areas have been developed with the assistance of the Towns of\nTroutman and Mooresville and the City of Statesville. The USA boundaries have been\nestablished based on the assumption that the municipalities will grow within these areas\nand utilities will be extended either voluntarily or upon request. These boundaries are\nnot static; they are based on the ability of the municipalities to deliver utilities and\nservices. Therefore, the USAs are subject to change.\nThe USA boundaries will serve as the basis for three (3) primary functions to facilitate and\naddress future growth:\n1.

Determining\nwhether an area can be reasonably served by utilities within a given amount of time\n(5 years by this arrangement) must be resolved prior to a decision to release county\njurisdiction.\nC. Existing ETJ\nWhen a municipality requests additional ETJ, the municipality must demonstrate its\nprogress in annexing and supplying municipal services, especially water and sewer\nwithin existing ETJ areas.\nD. Special Standards\nWhen evaluating an ETJ expansion request, the municipality's application of special\nregulations to its existing ETJ, such as transportation improvements along significant\ncorridors, should be considered as evidence of its willingness to apply these special\nregulations. The municipality must also demonstrate a willingness to adopt such or\nsimilar regulations for new areas under consideration for ETJ expansion. If the county\nhas developed area-specific standards such as corridor protection overlays or\nperennial stream buffers it will be important to continue those protections.\nE. Municipal Utilities\nThe municipality should show how the area proposed for ETJ expansion will be\nserved by water and sewer service within five (5) years of the effective date of ETJ\nexpansion. The systems should be designed with adequate treatment capacity and\nadequately sized major trunk line extensions to service the area proposed for ETJ\nexpansion. The municipality should include needed improvements above and\nbeyond those proposed in relation to a specific project in its capital improvements\nprogram. If the municipality will be required to make improvements or adjustments\n(generally oversizing) to utilities that will be attributed to a specific project they must\nbe documented in the ETJ request.\nF.

Prior to the initiation of any work on a parcel of land, a zoning permit must be\nobtained from the Department of Planning and Development, through the Zoning\nPermit Clerk. If the work is non-residential (or multi-family residential) in nature, a\nnon-residential site plan must be submitted.\nB. To begin the site plan process it is recommended that the applicant meet with the\nZoning Administrator to discuss the regulations found in the Land Development\nCode that pertain to the project (Sections 8.2 and 8.3).\nStep 2. Site Plan Development and Other Submittals\nThe applicant shall develop the site plan to meet the requirements detailed in Section\n9.2. In addition, if an Erosion Control Plan is required, it may be submitted to the Erosion\nControl Administrator at this time.\nStep 3. Review and Necessary Changes\nZoning Administrator reviews site plan and requests any needed changes. In the event\nof a sign permit, the Administrator may visit the site to verify setbacks and other sign\nlocations.\nStep 4. Zoning Permit and Environmental Health\nA. Upon receipt of any necessary changes the Zoning Administrator shall issue a Zoning\nPermit and Grading Permit for the project.\nB. If necessary, the applicant must then visit the Environmental Health Division to\ndiscuss the project and set up a site visit. If sanitary sewer is to be used in lieu of a\nseptic system, the applicant must furnish at the time of the permit application a\nletter from the entity owning or controlling the sewer granting approval to connect\nto the system.\nStep 5. Environmental Health Inspection\nA. The Environmental Health Division will make a site inspection and develop a septic\ntank layout for the site. This will be made based on the topography, location of any\nstructures and site improvements, the well, and other site features.\nB. If there is a problem with the layout and a system cannot be designed based on the\nconstruction that is being proposed, the applicant may need to make changes to\nthe Zoning Permit, which will require contacting the Planning and Development\nDepartment.\nIredell County Land Development Code\n8-28\n"}, {"page": "211", "text": "C.

They are broken into two categories, legislative and quasi-\njudicial.\nA. Legislative Decisions\nThese types of decisions set general policies. Decisions to adopt, amend, or repeal an\nordinance (including the zoning map) fall into this category. There are detailed\nstatutory procedural requirements for legislative decisions, however the decision itself is\noften discretionary. A public hearing is required to make a legislative decision, with the\nintent being to gain public opinion on the decision being made. The only site plan that\nmay require a legislative decision is a Conditional Zoning or Expansion of a Non-\nConforming Use.\n1. Conditional Zoning:\nAll Conditional Zoning applications may include a conceptual site plan, drawn\nto scale, and supporting text that, if approved, will become part of the\namendment. The site plan must include any supporting information and text that\nspecifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules,\nregulations, and conditions that in addition to all predetermined ordinance\nrequirements, will govern the development and use of the property. In addition,\nif only rezoning a portion of a parcel, a plat must be provided, drawn to scale,\nshowing the bearings and distances of the portion requested. The site plan,\nincluding the information detailed below shall constitute part of the petition for\nrezoning to a conditional zoning district.\n2. Expansion of a Non-Conforming Use:\nThe applicant must submit a site plan, drawn to scale, that will provide an\nadequate amount of information to make a determination on the viability of the\nexpansion request. It is recommended that the applicant provide a site plan\nthat includes the items listed in 9.2.1, therefore if the request is approved it can\nthen move forward to permitting.\nB. Quasi-Judicial Decisions\nThese decisions include the application of specific policies to individual situations rather\nthan the adoption of new policies and are generally heard by the Board of Adjustment.\nThese decisions contain two key elements, the finding of facts regarding a specific\nproposal and the exercise of judgment or discretion in applying the policies of this\nordinance.\n1. Special Use Permits:\nAll applications must include a site plan, drawn to scale, and supporting text\nthat, if approved, will become part of the permit. The applicant shall, at a\nminimum, include each of the items listed in Section 9.2.1. Additionally, the site\nplan must include any supporting information and text that specifies the actual\nuse or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations, and conditions\nthat in addition to all predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the\nIredell County Land Development Code\n9-4\n"}, {"page": "221", "text": "development and use of the property.
