A nonconforming use shall be any land use or type of residential use that was\nlegally established but has become a prohibited use in the district in which it exists.\nB.\nNONCONFORMING LOT. A nonconforming lot shall be any legally established parcel that does not conform\nto the current area or dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.\nC.\nNONCONFORMING IMPROVEMENT OR STRUCTURE.

In order to reduce the\nnecessity of resulting multiple similar zoning variance actions, certain minor nonconforming\nelements may be determined to be exempt from strict compliance through the following:\na.\nAny existing development which meets the setback and rear yard requirements of its\nzoning district prior to amendment but will exceed front setback and/or rear yard\nminimums in the proposed new zoning district, up to twenty feet (20'), will be considered\nto be in conformance to the new zoning district provisions.\nb.\nAny existing development which meets the side yard requirements of its zoning district\nprior to amendment but will exceed one or more side yard minimums in the proposed\nnew zoning district, up to ten feet (10'), will be considered to be in conformance to the\nnew zoning district provisions.\nC.\nAny existing development which meets the minimum parking requirements of its zoning\ndistrict prior to amendment but will be deficient in required parking by up to ten percent\n(10%) for parcels up to two (2) acres in size, or will be deficient by up to fifteen percent\n(15%) for parcels greater than two (2) acres, will be considered to be in conformance to\nthe new zoning district provisions.\nd.\nAny existing development which did not have to meet any minimum landscape\nregulations prior to amendment but will be deficient in some required landscaping in the\nproposed new zoning district will be exempt from installation of new landscaping to meet\ncurrent standards.\nPage 4 - 2\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ne.\nAny existing development which meets the landscaping requirement imposed on it at the\ntime of the last successful zoning action on the site but would not be in compliance in the\nproposed new zoning district, will be considered to be in conformance to the new zoning\ndistrict provisions.\nf.\nAny existing development which meets the signage provisions imposed on it at the time\nof the last successful zoning action on the site but would not be in compliance in the\nproposed new zoning district, will be considered to be in conformance with the new\nzoning district provisions if both: any single sign on the site is no more than twenty\npercent (20%) greater in sign area than what would be allowed in the proposed zoning\ndistrict; and the total signs on the site are not in aggregate more than fifteen percent\n(15%) greater in sign area and number than would be allowed under the proposed zoning\ndistrict.\n2.\nAny site which has existing development and utilizes one or more of the exemptions listed in \u00a7\n155.401.1.I.1, above, may continue in active use and may change from one land use to another\nunder the exemptions listed above.

This Title identifies multiple residential, nonresidential, and mixed use zoning districts that may\nbe assigned to parcels within the Town's jurisdiction. There are certain uses or site design layouts which\nbecause of their nature or scale have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a\nwhole. Development of these uses and situations may benefit the community, but their unique aspects and\nneeds cannot be predetermined within the confines of general district regulations. In addition,\ncircumstances often arise when a general district designation would not be appropriate for a certain\nproperty, but a specific use or group of uses permitted under the district would be consistent with the\nobjectives of this Title. To accommodate these specific situations, Parallel Traditional and Conditional-\nOnly districts (conditional districts) may be employed.\nB.\nPARALLEL TRADITIONAL DISTRICTS. The Parallel Traditional district process is established to address those\nsituations when a particular use may be acceptable but the Traditional classification which would allow that\nuse would not be acceptable. It allows the Board of Commissioners to approve a proposal for a specific use\nor group of uses with reasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of the use(s) with surrounding\nproperties. Any use permitted under this process must also conform to the development regulations for the\ncorresponding Traditional zoning district. This is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm\ndevelopment proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals which\nmay not be undertaken for some time, unless a condition is included to have all development go through a\nsubsequent site plan and/or elevation plan review and approval by the Board of Commissioners.\n1.\nPotential uses which may be considered for a Parallel Traditional district are restricted to those\nuses permitted in the corresponding Traditional zoning district. Uses permitted in Parallel\nTraditional districts are subject to all applicable development standards and requirements for that\nuse listed in the corresponding Traditional zoning district.\n2.\nThe application for a Parallel Traditional district must contain information and/or site plans which\nwill indicate all of the principal and accessory uses which are proposed to be developed on the\nPage 4-8\n"}, {"page": "63", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nsite. Subsequent to the approval of a Parallel Traditional district, only those principal and accessory\nuses indicated on the approved plan may be constructed on the site. Any modifications to an\napproved plan or any changes in the permitted principal or accessory uses must comply with the\nprovisions of \u00a7 155.401. [formerly \u00a7 153.202]\nC.\nCONDITIONAL-ONLY DISTRICTS. The Conditional-Only district process allows certain uses to be\nestablished in accordance with specific development standards for each use. The categories listed at \u00a7\n155.501.3.B may be utilized only through the Conditional-Only district process. The standards for these\ndistricts are provided in Chapter 5.\nD.\nAPPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCESS. The following process applies to both the Parallel Traditional\nand\nConditional-Only districts. For simplicity the term conditional district shall be used in this section to refer\nto both types of districts unless otherwise noted.\n1.\nAPPLICATION.

A conditional district classification shall be considered only if the application is made by\nthe owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. All applications must include a schematic\nplan drawn to scale and supporting text which will become part of the ordinance amendment. The\napplicant should include at least the items listed below:\na.\nA boundary survey showing the total acreage, present zoning classifications, date, and\nnorth arrow.\nb.\nThe owners' names, addresses, and the tax parcel numbers of all adjoining properties.\nc.\nAll existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way, and all yards required for the\nzoning district(s) requested.\nd.\nProposed use of land and structures. A site plan drawing, to scale, shall be submitted\nshowing the outline of each building, related parking and vehicular circulation, pedestrian\nfacilities, storage, service and loading facilities, vehicular queuing plans where\nappropriate for the use, storm water improvements, recreational facilities, required\nlandscape screening and buffers, and all other planned improvements to the site. When\nthis level of detail design has not yet been prepared, the applicant may choose to submit a\ngeneralized site plan document showing overall proposed land use by location, vehicular\nand non-vehicular circulation patterns, preserved natural or historic features, and required\nlandscape screening and buffers. This generalized site plan must include a written\ncondition that all development on the site will go through a subsequent site plan and/or\nelevation plan review and approval by the Board of Commissioners. In addition, general\ninformation on the intended density and intensity of development at build-out must be\nincluded on the site plan. For residential uses this should include the number of units and\nan outline of the area where the structures will be located. For nonresidential uses this\nshould include the approximate square footage of all structures and an outline of the area\nwhere such structures will be located. For applications for Early Designation to an\napplicable Condition-Only district, a lesser level of detail is necessary. A site map\nshowing land area in the requested zoning action is minimally required, along with\nadditional written and/or graphic conditions matching the adopted small area plan or\ngeneral development plan for the geographic area, and conditions indicating any\nproposed refinement of design standards of the proposed Conditional-Only district.\ne.\nTraffic, parking, and circulation plans, showing the proposed locations and arrangement\nof parking spaces and access points to adjacent streets, all sidewalks, bicycle facilities,\nand multi-modal pathways for non-motorized transportation. For Early Designation\napplications, general motor vehicle and pedestrian/bicycle circulation plans, in written\nand/or graphic format, shall be submitted, sufficient to show compliance with any small\narea plan or general development plan for the geographic area.\n2.\nADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS. When dealing with the conditional district process, it may be desirable\nto request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the\nsurrounding area. Therefore the Planning Director, Planning Board and/or the Board of\nCommissioners may request additional information as they deem necessary. This information\nmay include but is not limited to the items listed below.\nPage 4-9\n"}, {"page": "64", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\na.\nProposed screening, including walls, fences, or planting areas as well as treatment of any\nexisting natural features.\nb.\nDelineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on official Flood Hazard\nBoundary Maps for Mecklenburg County.\nc.\nExisting and proposed topography at four foot (4') contour intervals or less.\nd.\nGeneralized information on the number, height, size, or location of structures.\ne.\nProposed number and location of signs.\nf.\nApproximate completion time of the project and proposed phasing, if any.\n3.\nREVIEW AND APPROVAL.\na.\nIn considering an application for the establishment of a conditional district, the Board of\nCommissioners may request conditions that exceed the minimum regulations set forth in\nthe Unified Development Ordinance. Any conditions should exhibit the relationship of\nthe proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, and other matters that the Board may find appropriate or the applicant may\npropose. The applicant will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any\nsuch requirements prior to final action by the Board of Commissioners.

If an application is approved, the conditional district established and all\nconditions attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and\nuse of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. The intent of\nthis type of zoning is to provide an alternative procedure for specific development proposals. It is\nintended that all property be zoned only in accordance with firm plans to develop. Therefore,\nthree years from approval, the Planning Board will examine the progress made to develop in\naccordance with approved plans to determine if active efforts are proceeding. If it is determined\nby the Planning Board that active efforts to comply with the approved plan are not proceeding, a\nreport will be forwarded to the Board of Commissioners which may recommend that action be\ninitiated to remove the conditional district in accordance with the amendment procedures outlined\nin \u00a7 155.401.1 and \u00a7 155.401.4.\n5.\nZONING MAP DESIGNATION. Following Board of Commissioners approval of a conditional district,\nthe property in question will be identified on the zoning map by the appropriate Parallel Traditional\nor Conditional-Only district designation. [formerly \u00a7 153.201]\n155.401.7\nUse of Flexible Design Standards\nA.\nOPPORTUNITY TO APPLY. Certain conditional zoning districts are intended to allow flexibility in overall\ndesign through the use of Flexible Design Provisions. Because it is not always possible to anticipate\nvariations or improvements in the development types or to accommodate changes with broad, all-\nencompassing regulations which could create good quality of life opportunities, these provisions allow the\nBoard of Commissioners to consider and evaluate new and flexible design concepts in a specially designated\nand controlled setting.\nPage 4 10\n"}, {"page": "65", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n1.\nThe R-VS SRN, C-MF, MUD, TS, and ENT Conditional-Only districts provide such a setting.\nTherefore, the opportunity for flexible design standards may be included as an integral part of\nproposals for these districts.\n2.\nThe Cottage Cluster Housing alternative in the residential districts provide such a setting.\nTherefore, the opportunity for flexible design standards may be included as an integral part of\nproposals for Cottage Cluster Housing within any of the single-family zoning districts when\nrequested through a Parallel Traditional district process.\n3.\nVarious permitted uses within the CrC district may apply flexible design standards.\nB.\nPURPOSE. It is the objective of these flexible design standards to encourage development proposals that\nexhibit such special qualities or concepts that they may deviate from standard ordinance requirements.\nThese regulations are established in order that a flexible design proposal will be evaluated on its own\nmerits. It is recognized that some proposals or concepts will be more successful than others, and the\napproval of a specific proposal in one situation does not mean that a similar proposal would be acceptable\nin other circumstances. These provisions are purely optional and are a voluntary means by which land may\nbe developed outside of the standard ordinance requirements. These provisions are designed to evaluate\nonly those flexible design concepts that propose to meet a community need that would not otherwise be\nmet. Finally, it should be emphasized that these provisions should not be confused with or take the place of\nthe normal zoning and subdivision variance procedures established either in \u00a7 155.403 or \u00a7 155.712.\nC.\nCERTAIN ZONING DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS MAY BE MODIFIED.

Small Residential Neighborhood District (SRN)\nA.\nThe Small Residential Neighborhood (SRN) District is established to provide an alternative residential\nenvironment from a traditional single-family detached subdivision pattern which incorporates various styles\nof housing intermingled and at differing densities, with an overall density averaging under twenty (20)\nPage 5 21\n"}, {"page": "110", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ndwellings per acre. Improved open space, wooded natural areas, common gardening space, and non-street\nwalking and biking connections are all encouraged to be interwoven into the neighborhood design. A limited\namount of nonresidential uses may be incorporated into the proposed development when it can clearly serve\nthe residents within the SRN site through employment opportunities, or by providing civic uses or needed\nroutine services, such as day care or dry cleaners, but not predominately the sale of merchandise. The map\nsymbol and short name for the Small Residential Neighborhood District shall be \"SRN\".\nConsideration of SRN district designation may result from the creation and adoption of a general concept\nplan or small area plan which becomes an appendix in the Matthews Land Use Plan. Such a small area plan\nmay include all the area of one SRN proposed district, or may include a larger geographic location. Any\nsmall area plan which is used as a basis for designation of an SRN district will identify the need for alternative\nstyles and higher density residential development in the vicinity of the proposed location, and show existing\nor future pedestrian connectivity to a proposed SRN site. The small area plan may include required elements\nsuch as minimum required street and pedestrian main networks to assure connectivity to a mix of other uses\nwithin a walkable distance.\nAs a Conditional-Only District, parcels of land may be zoned to this category following the procedures\nexplained at \u00a7 155.501.3.C. and D., at the time a specific development project is submitted for consideration,\nor parcels may receive early designation as outlined in \u00a7 155.501.3.I., prior to any specific plan due to their\nlocation as an area identified by the Matthews Board of Commissioners for this zoning designation, with the\ncondition that prior to any land disturbing activity, a site specific plan for development shall be approved\nthrough the site plan approval process as described at \u00a7 155.401.5.B.\nB.\nLot development and design standards, as outlined in \u00a7 155.605, and dimensional standards of \u00a7 155.604.3,\napply to the SRN District.

Supplementary standards which may be applicable to certain uses within the SRN district are\nlisted at \u00a7 155.506. Except where the standards given within this subsection \u00a7 155.503.3 specifically for the\nSRN district differ, the parking provisions at \u00a7 155.607, the sign provisions at \u00a7 155.608, and the lighting\nprovisions at \u00a7 155.609 apply to the SRN district.\nC.\nOTHER STANDARDS UNIQUE TO THE SRN DISTRICT.

Where the provisions in this \u00a7 155.503.3 conflict with the provisions of other\nSections of this Title, except for Overlay district requirements, this Section shall prevail.\nD.\nEARLY DESIGNATION. Where a parcel has received the designation of SRN prior to a full development\nproposal on it, as outlined at \u00a7 155.501.3.I, sufficient drawings and documents to clearly prove compliance\nto the design elements listed in \u00a7 155.503.3.E through G below shall be submitted to the Matthews Planning\noffice for review and recommendation in the same way as a rezoning application is handled by Town staff.\nUpon completion of review, Town staff and applicants shall meet to review staff findings. Applicants shall\nprovide additional or revised documents as determined necessary to show compliance to all standards.\nSubmission of a request for site plan and/or elevation plan approval shall then be forwarded to the Matthews\nBoard of Commissioners.

Alleys are encouraged to provide vehicular access to off-street parking for\nindividual dwellings in the SRN district. Alley entrances should generally align, but\ninternal deflections or variations in the alley network to prevent excessive lengths or\nmonotonous views of the rear of structures are encouraged. All alleys shall be identified\nas either public or private, and any public alley shall be dedicated to the public as provided\nfor in Chapter 7.\nh.\nA thematic and cohesive streetscape planting and lighting plan shall be prepared for the\nSRN district at time of initial designation. The streetscape plan shall incorporate street\ntrees to provide both form (canopy) and comfort (shade) to the street. Street trees give\nspecial character and coherence to each street. Lighting shall be incorporated to provide\nnight-time illumination under the tree canopy for safety and ambiance for pedestrians, and\nadequate illumination for vehicular traffic.\ni.\nFRONTS AND REARS. Building facades are the public \"face\" of every building. Owners and\noccupants are encouraged to utilize planters and window boxes filled with colorful plants\nalong each fa\u00e7ade that fronts a public street.

The SRN district establishes minimum standards for development and design. Those\nstandards however might not always be appropriate to the particular development. Accordingly,\nnew\ndevelopment concepts, innovative design, unique circumstances or public/private ventures may require the\nuse of alternative development or design standards. In such cases, the development requirements specified\nhere for the SRN district in \u00a7 155.503.43 may be modified through the Flexible Design provisions of \u00a7\n155.401.7 of this Title.\n155.503.4.\nConcentrated Multi-Family District (C-MF)\nA.\nThe Concentrated Multi-Family District is established to provide for a variety of multi-family residential uses\nat considerably higher densities and within an urban setting not traditionally found in Matthews. This district\nis intended primarily for housing in the form of attached units, individual multi-family buildings, and planned\nmulti-family complexes with front entrances located close to public streets, and in close proximity to existing\nor planned transit stops, arterial streets, or the downtown. The district is intended to be employed either as\nsmall scattered locations or in larger tracts, but any location shall be designed to accommodate a minimum\naverage of twelve (12) dwelling units per acre with no maximum density established by this code. Location\nand number of parking spaces is based on various standards that can be met by the development site and its\nsurroundings. Provision and improvement of public and/or private recreational space is based on location\nand number of dwelling units created. Certain nonresidential uses of a public or semi-public nature are also\npermitted and strongly encouraged to be incorporated in the overall design. The map symbol and short name\nfor the Concentrated Multi-Family District shall be \"C-MF\".\nConsideration of C-MF district designation may result from the creation and adoption of a general concept\nplan or small area plan which becomes an appendix in the Matthews Land Use Plan. Such a small area plan\nmay include all the area of one C-MF proposed district, or may include a larger geographic location. Any\nsmall area plan which is used to encourage the designation of a C-MF district shall identify the need for\nhigher density residential development in the vicinity of the proposed location, and show existing or future\nPage 5 24\n"}, {"page": "113", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\npedestrian connectivity to a proposed C-MF site.

Street stubs must be provided to adjoining undeveloped\nareas to accommodate future street connectivity.\nb.\nStreets do not have to form a rectangular grid, but may curve or bend to connect to other\nstreets. Intersections between arterials and collectors must have centerline offsets of at\nleast one hundred fifty feet (150'). This requirement does not apply to intersections\nbetween alleys and local streets.\nc.\nThe proposed street network should respect topography and designated environmental\nresources and be modified accordingly to avoid damages to such resources.\nd.\nSidewalks and street trees must be provided on both sides of all streets. Street trees may be\nomitted where arcades are provided which would restrict adequate space for natural tree\ncanopy growth.\ne.\nPermanent dead-end streets are not permitted except where physical conditions such as\nlimited access highways, sensitive natural resources, or unusual topography provide no\npractical connection alternatives. Each dead end must be detailed as a circular turn-around,\na close, a hammerhead, or a \"Y\" turn-around and should provide pedestrian connectivity\nto the maximum extent practicable.\nf.\nPrivate streets and gated streets are prohibited. All streets must be dedicated to the public,\nalthough alleys may be private.\ng.\nALLEYS AND SERVICE ACCESS. A clearly-defined network of rear and side alleys is\nencouraged to provide vehicular access to off-street parking and service/loading facilities\nfor individual lots in the MUD District. Alley entrances should generally align SO as to\nprovide ease of ingress for service vehicles, but internal deflections or variations in the\nalley network are encouraged to prevent excessive or monotonous views of the rear of\nPage 5 35\n"}, {"page": "124", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nstructures resulting from long stretches of alleys.

A thematic and cohesive streetscape planting and lighting plan shall\nbe prepared for the MUD district at time of initial designation. The streetscape plan shall\nincorporate street trees to provide both form (canopy) and comfort (shade) to the street.\nStreet trees give special character and coherence to each street. Lighting shall be\nincorporated to provide night-time illumination under the tree canopy for safety and\nambiance for pedestrians, and adequate illumination for vehicular traffic.\ni.\nFRONTS AND REARS. Building facades are the public \"face\" of every building. Owners and\noccupants are encouraged to utilize planters and window boxes filled with colorful plants\nalong each fa\u00e7ade that fronts a public street, plaza, parking lot, or similar public use realm.\nThe private, interior portions of the lots (toward the alley) allow commercial operators to\nutilize these spaces as efficient working environments unseen by the public and allow\nresidents to have private and semi-private (for apartment and condominium buildings)\ngardens and courtyards.\n3.\nBLOCKS. Except as otherwise provided, block perimeters may not exceed eight hundred (800) lineal\nfeet as measured along the edges of each street right-of-way forming the block. Blocks may\nalternatively be broken by a civic space provided that lot is at least fifty feet (50') wide and will\nprovide perpetual pedestrian access between the blocks and to any lots that front the civic space.\nSmaller blocks are encouraged to promote walkability.\nBlock perimeters may exceed this limit, up to a maximum of four thousand (4,000) lineal feet, only\nif one or more of the following conditions apply:\na.\nThe block has at least one block face on an arterial street; or\nb.\nThe block face contains valuable natural features or significant historic resources that\nshould not be crossed by a street.\n4.\nPARKING. While public street cross sections may include on-street parking on many streets and\nparking requirements may be reduced within the MUD district, a substantial amount of required\nparking will need to be provided on private property, either on the same parcel as the associated use\nor on a nearby parcel.\na.\nMINIMUM VEHICULAR PARKING STANDARDS. The following minimum requirements are\nestablished in the MUD district:\ni.\nNonresidential uses: 1 space per 300 square feet of gross floor area.\nii.\nPlanned multiple-family development:\niii.\nAll other residential uses as permitted in the MUD District are required to provide\noff-street motor vehicle parking in accordance with the minimum standards set\nforth in \u00a7 155.607.2 of this Title.\nb.\nBICYCLE PARKING.

Cross access is required between\nadjoining rear/side parking lots.\nd.\nThe required minimum number of off-street parking spaces may be provided in any\nlocation within the MUD District project area. However, each construction phase of the\nMUD project must comply with the off-street parking requirements of this \u00a7 155.503.5.\ne.\nSHARED PARKING.\ni.\nShared location of cumulative required spaces. Owners and developers are\nencouraged to design a shared parking system for part or all of a MUD District to\ndistribute the daily and twenty four (24) hour parking load in a joint effort in\nshared parking lots or structures. Shared internal parking facilities increase\nbuilding and public use coverage fronting streets within the district. Shared off-\nsite parking facilities may initially be surface lots that may be converted to\nstructured parking if and when intensity of development within the district reaches\na level where structured parking becomes economically viable to the surrounding\nuses. A written agreement between property owners explaining what parcel or\nparcels shall utilize structured parking, and which will remain binding on future\nowners and land uses, shall be signed and recorded with the Mecklenburg County\nRegister of Deeds office. Conversion of surface parking to structured parking\nshall provide documentation that minimum required spaces continue to be\nprovided for all included properties.\nii.\nShared use of same spaces. Shared parking of required parking spaces may be\npermitted with approval from the Planning Director as provided in \u00a7\n155.607.2.G.6 of this Title.\nf.\nWhere on-street or public parking lot spaces are located within four hundred feet (400') of\na building entrance, up to a twenty five percent (25%) reduction to required on-site parking\nmay be allowed for new construction.\ng.\nNew on-street parking spaces developed adjacent to and in conjunction with a new building\nmay be counted toward the minimum on-site parking requirements for that building. Any\nsuch on-street parking spaces may only be attributed to meeting minimum parking\nrequirements for one new building.\nh.\nPARKING STRUCTURES. Parking structures are encouraged to create shared parking\nopportunities and to reduce the footprint of surface lots. Single-use parking structures must\nbe located behind other buildings. Structured parking is permitted and encouraged in\nmixed use buildings. Structured parking may extend below grade and may contain multiple\nlevels of parking above grade. Parking structures may contain other uses above the parking\nlevels provided the entire building does not exceed the height allowed in the MUD District.\nPartially enclosed parking spaces may be created with habitable space cantilevered over\nthem at the rear of a building, or along the side of a building when a solid wall blocks view\nof parked vehicles from any public street or pedestrian pathway.\n5.\nUSES UNABLE TO UTILIZE STREETFRONT FENESTRATION. When certain uses such as a theater\nor\nplanetarium cannot comply with the required door and window standards for primary facades, then\nthey may be constructed in a manner that they will be separated from adjacent streets by a use or\nuses that will create the necessary openings in the exterior wall surface.\na.\nIndoor public assembly space may be created when appropriate for the related use, such as\na ticket and concessions area and customer lobby for a theater, or an exhibition and display\nspace for a museum. Adequate windows and door openings would be required in this space\nalong the exterior wall, allowing view from the public realm to an occupied and active\ninterior space.\nb.\nLiner buildings may be used. When designed to provide visual enclosure for a particular\nuse from a public street or public use area, they may be detached from or attached to the\nPage 5 37\n"}, {"page": "126", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nbuilding(s) they are concealing.

When a wide building is placed directly across a street from significantly\nnarrower lots or buildings, the principal fa\u00e7ade on the wide building must be varied with a change\nof architectural expression that reflects the widths of the narrower lots. These changes in expression\nmay be a vertical element running from sidewalk to roof, a change in fenestration or style, color, or\ntexture, or a break in fa\u00e7ade plane or roof line. These changes may be subtle or significant, but must\nsoften the visual effect of very wide buildings directly across the street from narrower buildings.\nG.\nBUILDING DESIGN GUIDELINES.\n1.\nGENERAL BUILDING DESIGN PRINCIPLES. The principles listed at \u00a7 155.603 shall be adhered to when\ndesigning any development within the MUD district. All buildings within the MUD District project\nmust be architecturally compatible in appearance and quality through the use of similar building\nmaterials, colors, architectural features and styles. An identified set of architectural styles or specific\narchitectural elements may be utilized to create an overall design theme.\n2.\nEXTERIOR BUILDING WALLS.\na.\nPrimary exterior wall materials, which shall cover at least seventy five percent (75%) of\neach fa\u00e7ade, excluding any glazed areas, shall consist of brick, other masonry, or native\nstone (or synthetic equivalent).\nb.\nSecondary materials, which may cover up to twenty five percent (25%) of each fa\u00e7ade,\nexcluding any glazed areas, may include hardiboard siding, wood siding, and stucco.\nc.\nAccent materials and trim may cover up to ten percent (10%) of each fa\u00e7ade excluding any\nglazed areas. Such accents and trim materials may include pre-cast masonry (for trim and\ncornice elements only), Gypsum Reinforced Fiber Concrete (GFRC-for trim elements\nonly), metal (for beams, lintels, trim elements and ornamentation only), and split-faced\nblock (only for piers, foundation walls and chimneys). All accent and trim materials shall\nbe identified on elevation plans.\nd.\nColors of all non-glazing exterior materials on any building shall be limited to no more\nthan three (3), unless the building is both larger in overall size than sixty thousand (60,000)\nsquare feet and at least three (3) stories in height. Such larger buildings may employ up to\nfive (5) distinct colors on its exterior facades. For the purpose of this standard, the term\ncolor shall also refer to two (2) clearly different shades of the same color, such as a light\ngreen and a dark green, or a pastel pink and a burgundy red.\ne.\nAlternative percentages of listed materials or types of materials may be requested by the\nFlexible Design Provisions at \u00a7 155.503.5.H. at the time of initial district designation, or\nthrough the Administrative Amendment process for an individual building after it has\nreceived site plan and elevation plan approval.\n3.\nCONFIGURATIONS AND TECHNIQUES FOR EXTERIOR WALLS: The following configurations and\ntechniques are permitted.\na.\nWALLS\nb.\nWOOD SIDING AND WOOD SIMULATION MATERIALS\ni.\nLap siding (horizontal) configuration\nii.\nSmooth or rough-sawn finish (no faux wood grain)\nPage 5 38\nCELL (1, 1): \ni.\nCELL (1, 2): \nThe horizontal dimension of the wall opening shall not exceed the vertical\ndimension except where otherwise prescribed in this Title.\nCELL (2, 1): \nii.\nCELL (2, 2): \nWall openings shall not span vertically more than one (1) story.\nCELL (3, 1): \niii.\nCELL (3, 2): \nWall openings shall correspond to interior space and shall not span across building\nstructure such as the floor structural and mechanical thickness.\nCELL (4, 1): \niv.\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaterial changes shall be made within a constructional logic-as where an\naddition (of a different material) is built onto the original building.\n"}, {"page": "127", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nc.\nBRICK,\nBLOCK AND STONE.

The MUD District establishes minimum standards for development and design. Those\nstandards however might not always be appropriate to the particular development. Accordingly, new\ndevelopment concepts, innovative design, unique circumstances or public/private ventures may require the\nuse of alternative development or design standards. In such cases, the development requirements specified\nhere for the MUD district in \u00a7 155.503.5 may be modified through the Flexible Design provisions of \u00a7\n155.401.7 of this Title.\n155.503.6.\nTransit-Supportive District (TS)\nA.\nThe Transit-Supportive District is established to create beneficial new mixed-use development opportunities\nat higher densities and intensities of use not customarily found in Matthews specifically to provide a\npedestrian-oriented physical environment that reduces vehicle miles traveled within the district and\naccommodates the physical needs of public transit services. This district is intended to be established within\none thousand three hundred (1,300') to two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') of a transit station or park\nand ride facility and may be established in advance of public transit service if located in accordance with the\nMatthews Land Use Plan along an existing, planned or proposed transit service corridor. The Transit-\nSupportive District is characterized by density and a diversity of land uses in mixed-use buildings with off-\nstreet parking in parking structures, wide sidewalks, on-street parking, and public plazas. The map symbol\nand short name for the Transit-Supportive District shall be \"TS District\".\nA general concept plan will be created and adopted for each identified transit station location, and will\nbecome an appendix in the Matthews Land Use Plan. Each transit station small area plan may offer unique\nfocus elements based on the specific character of the surrounding land uses and transportation network.\nElements anticipated in all transit station small area plans include placing the densest uses that will generate\nthe most walkable interfaces closest to the stations, with primary entrances to commercial and service uses\nhighly accessible to transit passengers as well as neighborhood residents. These transit station general\nconcept plans may include required elements if the build-out may be phased over time, such as initial required\nstreet and pedestrian main networks to assure connectivity, or a minimum/maximum amount of certain types\nPage 5 43\n"}, {"page": "132", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nof land uses to guarantee a full range mix of uses. The suggested maximum boundaries of each distinct TS\ndistrict location may be identified in the station general concept plans.\nAs a Conditional-Only District, parcels of land may be zoned to this category at the time a specific\ndevelopment project is submitted for consideration, or parcels may receive early designation as outlined at\n155.501.3.I to this category prior to any specific plans due to their proximity to an identified existing or future\ntransit station or park and ride facility, with the condition that prior to any land disturbing activity, a site\nspecific plan for development shall be approved through the site plan approval process as described at \u00a7\n155.401.5.B.\nB.\nLot development and design standards, as outlined in \u00a7 155.605, and dimensional standards of \u00a7 155.604.3,\napply to the TS district.

Supplementary standards which may be applicable to certain uses within the TS district are listed\nat \u00a7 155.506. Except where the standards given within this subsection \u00a7 155.503.6 specifically for the TS\ndistrict differ, the parking provisions at \u00a7 155.607, the sign provisions at \u00a7 155.608, and the lighting\nprovisions at \u00a7 155.609 apply to the TS district.\nC.\nADDITIONAL STANDARDS UNIQUE TO THE TRANSIT-SUPPORTIVE DISTRICT. In addition to the requirements\nof other sections of this Title, development and improvements in the Transit-Supportive District (\"TS\nDistrict\") shall comply with the following requirements. Where the provisions in this Section conflict with\nthe provisions of other Sections of this Title, this Section shall prevail.\n1.\nLOCATION REQUIREMENTS. The TS District must have frontage on an existing or proposed public\ntransit route and be located within a ten (10) minute walk (two thousand five hundred feet [2,500'])\nof an existing or approved future transit stop or station. A parcel not adjacent to the public transit\ncorridor but within a ten (10) minute walking distance of an existing improved transit stop or station\nmay also qualify for designation to the TS District. No development may occur on a parcel zoned\nTS until a general concept plan for the nearby transit station area is approved.\n2.\nMINIMUM TOTAL PROJECT AREA: There is no minimum project area.\n3.\nEXTERIOR PROJECT EDGE. Because the TS District is established to provide and enhance\nconnectivity between a transit stop or station and its environs and because the edge of the District\nshould be a seamless transition with adjoining districts, an exterior project edge is not required.\nHowever, land uses and building typologies in the TS District shall closely mimic the land uses and\nbuilding typologies on adjacent property or land uses shown on the Matthews Land Use Plan on\nadjacent property.\n4.\nDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. Development permitted within the TS District shall comply with the\nstandards for building typologies permitted in the TS District as provided in \u00a7 155.605 of this Title,\nand the urban design principles in \u00a7 155.503.6.F and G. below.\nD.\nEARLY DESIGNATION PROCESS. Where a parcel has received the designation of TS prior to a full development\nproposal on it, as outlined at \u00a7 155.501.3.I, sufficient drawings and documents to clearly prove compliance\nto the design elements listed in \u00a7 155.503.6.E through G below shall be submitted to the Matthews Planning\noffice for review and recommendation in the same way as a rezoning application is handled by Town staff.\nUpon completion of review, Town staff and applicants shall meet to review staff findings. Applicants shall\nprovide additional or revised documents as determined necessary to show compliance to all standards.\nSubmission of a request for site plan and/or elevation plan approval shall then be forwarded to the Matthews\nBoard of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners shall receive a report with recommendations from\nTown Planning staff on how well the proposal meets the intent of the district and the design criteria listed\nbelow, and determine when the proposal meets the requirements and can be approved.\nE.\nREVIEW CRITERIA. Proposals for transit-supportive development may be eligible for rezoning to the TS\nDistrict only if they incorporate the principles of transit-supportive design, including:\n1.\nA highly interconnected street network, dispersing traffic and providing safe convenient routes for\npedestrians and bicyclists.\n2.\nHigh-quality public spaces, with all building facades having windows and doors facing tree-lined\nstreets, plazas, squares, or neighborhood parks.\n3.\nCompact development, creating a walkable urban environment and conserving land and energy\nthrough reduced automobile usage and advanced techniques such as stormwater infiltration.\n4.\nDiversity not homogeneity, with a variety of building types, street types, open spaces, and land uses\nPage 5 44\n"}, {"page": "133", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nproviding for people of all ages and every form of mobility.\n5.\nResilient and sustainable neighborhoods, adaptable over time to improved public transit and to\nchanging economic conditions.\nF.\nSITE PLAN LAYOUT GENERAL DESIGN.\n1.\nGENERAL URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES.

Street stubs must be provided to adjoining undeveloped\nareas to accommodate future street connectivity.\nb.\nStreets do not have to form a rectangular grid, but may curve or bend to connect to other\nstreets. Intersections between arterials and collectors must have centerline offsets of at\nleast one hundred fifty feet (150'). This requirement does not apply to intersections\nbetween alleys and local streets.\nc.\nThe proposed street network should respect topography and designated environmental\nresources and be modified accordingly to avoid damages to such resources.\nd.\nSidewalks and street trees must be provided on both sides of all streets. Street trees may be\nomitted where arcades are provided which would restrict adequate space for natural tree\ncanopy growth.\ne.\nPermanent dead-end streets are not permitted except where physical conditions such as\nlimited access highways, sensitive natural resources, or unusual topography provide no\npractical connection alternatives. Each dead end must be detailed as a circular turn-around,\na close, a hammerhead, or a \"Y\" turn-around and should provide pedestrian connectivity\nto the maximum extent practicable.\nf.\nPrivate streets and gated streets are prohibited. All streets must be dedicated to the public.\ng.\nALLEYS AND SERVICE ACCESS. A continuous network of rear and side alleys must provide\nvehicular access to off-street parking and service/loading facilities for individual lots in the\nTS District. Alley entrances should generally align SO as to provide ease of ingress for\nservice vehicles, but internal deflections or variations in the alley network are encouraged\nto prevent excessive or monotonous views of the rear of structures resulting from long\nstretches of alleys. All alleys shall be identified as either public or private, and any public\nalley shall be dedicated to the public as provided for in Chapter 7.\nh.\nTHE STREETSCAPE. A streetscape planting and lighting plan shall be prepared for each\nblock face of each public street as any adjacent parcel is designated into the TS district.\nThe streetscape plan shall incorporate street trees to provide both form (canopy) and\ncomfort (shade) to the street. Street trees give special character and coherence to each\nstreet. Lighting shall be incorporated to provide night-time illumination under the tree\ncanopy for safety and ambiance for pedestrians, and adequate illumination for vehicular\ntraffic.\nPage 5 45\n"}, {"page": "134", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ni.\nFRONTS AND REARS. Building facades are the public \"face\" of every building. Owners and\noccupants are encouraged to utilize planters and window boxes filled with colorful plants\nalong each fa\u00e7ade that fronts a public street, plaza, parking lot, or similar public use realm.\nThe private, interior portions of the lots (toward the alley) allow commercial operators to\nutilize these spaces as efficient working environments unseen by the public and allow\nresidents to have private and semi-private (for apartment and condominium buildings)\ngardens and courtyards.\n3.\nBLOCKS. Except as otherwise provided, block perimeters may not exceed eight hundred (800) lineal\nfeet as measured along the edges of each street right-of-way forming the block. Blocks may\nalternatively be broken by a civic space provided that lot is at least fifty feet (50') wide and will\nprovide perpetual pedestrian access between the blocks and to any lots that front the civic space.\nSmaller blocks are encouraged to promote walkability.\na.\nBlock perimeters may exceed this limit, up to a maximum of four thousand (4,000) lineal\nfeet, only if one or more of the following conditions apply:\ni.\nThe block has at least one block face on an arterial street; or\nii.\nThe block face contains valuable natural features or significant historic resources\nthat should not be crossed by a street.\nb.\nAny single block face wider than six hundred feet (600') must include a publicly dedicated\nsidewalk, passage, or trail at least twelve feet (12') in width that connects to another street.\n4.\nOFF-STREET PARKING. While public street cross sections may include on-street parking on many\nstreets and parking requirements may be reduced within the TS district, a substantial amount of\nrequired parking will need to be provided on private property, either on the same parcel as the\nassociated use or on a nearby parcel.\na.\nPARK-ONCE SYSTEM. An owner/developer is encouraged to implement a park-once system\nof shared parking for part or all of a TS District to distribute the commercial parking load\nbetween on-street parking and shared parking lots or structures. An extensive park-once\nsystem may be submitted for approval as an alternative parking plan.\nIn order to reduce the amount of separate surface parking lots which can visually and\nspatially dominate development and therefore adversely affect desired density of build-out,\nvehicle parking shall have both a short-term and a long-term plan. Any development\nproject proposed in the TS District shall show how it can provide for its share of parking\nneeds when initially constructed, as well as a longer-term future demand. Off-site parking\nwithin shared parking facilities shall be allowed and is encouraged in order to increase\nbuilding and/or public use coverage fronting streets within the district. At the time of initial\napproval, a development proposal shall identify whether the project will include one or\nmore of the following, either upon initial construction or at a later phase: twenty (20) or\nmore residential units; six thousand (6,000) square feet or more of business or retail space;\nfifty (50) or more seating accommodations in a restaurant; or any public assembly or\nrecreational use facility that can accommodate fifty (50) or more persons (participants or\nattendees). Any proposed development meeting any of the given categories shall agree to\nparticipation in the district-wide shared parking program. This shared parking program\nmay allow multiple separate buildings or development projects to allocate a certain\npercentage of their required parking to a shared off-site parking facility, and may require\nproperty owners to participate in a special assessment process to build structured parking\nwhen certain district build-out levels are reached. Shared off-site parking facilities may\ninitially be surface lots that shall be converted to structured parking when district density\nlevels are reached. A written agreement between property owners explaining what parcel\nor parcels may utilize parking on a separate parcel, now and/or in the future, and which\nwill remain binding on future owners and land uses, shall be signed and recorded with the\nMecklenburg County Register of Deeds office prior to any land disturbing activity or any\npermit being issued for a parcel that requires off-site parking to meet minimum parking\nstandards.\nb.\nLOCATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING. To the maximum extent practicable, off-street\nparking spaces must be located within buildings or behind buildings SO that buildings\nPage 5 46\n"}, {"page": "135", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nscreen parking areas from sidewalks and streets. In no case may parking be located in the\nsetback or yard in front of a building. Parking lots in non-streetside (interior of block) side\nyards may be allowed provided these lots are placed a minimum of twenty feet (20') from\nlot lines adjoining rights-of-way, excluding alleys. Parking in shared off-site lots shall be\nwithin one thousand feet (1,000') of the property.\nC.\nACCESS TO OFF-STREET PARKING. Alleys must be the primary source of vehicular access\nto off-street parking. Parking along alleys or lanes may be 90 degree, angled, or parallel,\nand must be of sufficient depth to assure parked vehicles will not impede traffic movement\nin the alley. Where 90 degree or angled spaces are provided, they must be a minimum of\ntwenty feet (20') in length, and where parallel spaces are provided they must be a minimum\nof eight feet (8') in width. Any alley with parking spaces immediately adjacent must be\npaved a minimum of twenty feet (20') in width, with no obstructions such as doors,\ndumpsters, planters, bollards, mechanical equipment, street light poles, etc., that could\nrestrict the full width use of the pavement for vehicular maneuvering in and out of\ndesignated parking spaces. Cross access is required between adjoining rear/side parking\nlots.\nd.\nPARKING STRUCTURES. Parking structures are encouraged to create shared parking\nopportunities and to reduce the footprint of surface lots. Single-use parking structures must\nbe located behind other buildings. Structured parking is permitted and encouraged on liner\nbuildings and mixed use buildings. Structured parking may extend below grade and may\ncontain multiple levels of parking above grade. Parking structures may contain other uses\nabove the parking levels provided the entire building does not exceed the height allowed\nin the TS District. Partially enclosed parking spaces may be created with habitable space\ncantilevered over them at the rear of a building, or along the side of a building when a solid\nwall blocks view of parked vehicles from any public street or pedestrian pathway.\n5.\nUSES UNABLE TO UTILIZE STREETFRONT FENESTRATION. When certain uses such as a theater,\nparking, or planetarium cannot comply with the required door and window standards for primary\nfacades, then they may be constructed in a manner that they will be separated from adjacent streets\nby liner buildings.\na.\nLiner buildings must be at least two (2) stories in height with not less than twenty feet (20')\nin depth.\nb.\nLiner buildings may be detached from or attached to the building(s) they are concealing.\nc.\nLiner buildings may be used for any purpose allowed on the lot on which they are located\nexcept exclusively for parking.\nd.\nLiner buildings must meet the primary fa\u00e7ade transparency requirements in \u00a7 155.503.6.G.\n6.\nWIDE BUILDINGS. When a wide building is placed directly across a street from significantly\nnarrower lots or buildings, the principal facade on the wide building must be varied with a change\nof architectural expression that reflects the widths of the narrower lots. These changes in expression\nmay be a vertical element running from sidewalk to roof, a change in fenestration or style, color, or\ntexture, or a break in facade plane or roof line. These changes may be subtle or significant, but must\nsoften the visual effect of very wide buildings directly across the street from narrower buildings.\na.\nSTORY HEIGHT. The ground story of nonresidential and mixed-use buildings must be from\ntwelve feet (12') to eighteen feet (18') tall. The ground story of residential buildings shall\nbe a minimum of ten feet (10') tall. Each story above the ground story shall be at least\neight feet (8') tall. Any upper story taller than twelve feet (12') will count as two (2)\nstories. Story heights are measured from the floor to the bottom of the lowest structural\nmember that supports the story above.\nb.\nFIRST FLOOR ELEVATION ENTRANCES. Nonresidential and mixed use buildings shall have\ntheir primary public walk-in entrances level with, to no greater than six inches (6\") above\nthe adjacent walkway. When a nonresidential or mixed use building has more than one\nprimary public entrance and more than a one foot (1') difference in finished grade at\nvarious doorways, then the entrance adjacent to a public street shall meet this requirement.\nResidential buildings shall have their first habitable story at least eighteen inches (18\")\nabove the adjacent public walkway. Residential buildings with multiple doors shall meet\nPage 5 47\n"}, {"page": "136", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nthese height standards for doors facing public streets. Exceptions may be allowed through\na site plan review, when a written explanation is provided to indicate the basis for alternate\ndesign.\nc.\nLINER BUILDINGS. The character of some uses of land, such as theaters and parking\nstructures, would preclude their buildings from complying with the door and window\nrequirements for primary facades. Such buildings may be constructed in a manner that they\nwill be separated from adjacent streets (but not alleys) by liner buildings. Liner buildings:\nG.\nGENERAL BUILDING DESIGN PRINCIPLES.\n1.\nThe principles listed at \u00a7 155.603 shall be adhered to when designing any development within the\nTS district. An identified set of architectural styles or specific architectural elements may be utilized\nto create an overall design theme.\n2.\nEXTERIOR BUILDING WALLS\na.\nPrimary materials, which shall cover at least seventy five percent (75%) of each fa\u00e7ade,\nexcluding any glazed areas, shall consist of brick, other masonry, or native stone (or\nsynthetic equivalent).\nb.\nSecondary materials, which may cover up to twenty five percent (25%) of each fa\u00e7ade,\nexcluding any glazed areas, may include hardiboard siding, wood siding, and stucco.\nC.\nAccent materials and trim may cover up to ten percent (10%) of each fa\u00e7ade excluding any\nglazed areas. Such accents and trim materials may include pre-cast masonry (for trim and\ncornice elements only), Gypsum Reinforced Fiber Concrete (GFRC-for trim elements\nonly), metal (for beams, lintels, trim elements and ornamentation only), and split-faced\nblock (only for piers, foundation walls and chimneys). All accent and trim materials shall\nbe identified on elevation plans.\nd.\nColors of all non-glazing exterior materials on any building shall be limited to no more\nthan three, unless the building is both larger in overall size than sixty thousand (60,000)\nsquare feet and at least three (3) stories in height. Such larger buildings may employ up to\nfive (5) distinct colors on its exterior facades. For the purpose of this standard, the term\ncolor shall also refer to two (2) clearly different shades of the same color, such as a light\ngreen and a dark green, or a pastel pink and a burgundy red.\ne.\nAlternative percentages of listed materials or types of materials may be requested by the\nFlexible Design Provisions at \u00a7 155.503.6.H. at the time of initial district designation, or\nthrough the Administrative Amendment process for an individual building after it has\nreceived site plan and elevation plan approval.\n3.\nCONFIGURATIONS AND TECHNIQUES FOR EXTERIOR WALLS: The following configurations and\ntechniques are permitted.\na.\nWALLS\ni.\nThe horizontal dimension of the wall opening shall not exceed the vertical\ndimension except where otherwise prescribed in this Title.\nii.\nWall openings shall not span vertically more than one (1) story.\niii.\nWall openings shall correspond to interior space and shall not span across building\nstructure such as the floor structural and mechanical thickness.\niv.\nMaterial changes shall be made within a constructional logic-as where an\naddition (of a different material) is built onto the original building.\nPage 5 48\nCELL (1, 1): \ni.\nCELL (1, 2): \nMust be at least two (2) stories in height with not less than twenty feet (20') in\ndepth;\nCELL (2, 1): \nii.\nCELL (2, 2): \nMay be detached from or attached to the buildings they are concealing;\nCELL (3, 1): \niii.\nCELL (3, 2): \nMay be used for any purpose allowed on the lot on which they are located except\nfor parking; and\nCELL (4, 1): \niv.\nCELL (4, 2): \nMust meet the primary facade transparency requirements in the preceding\nsubsection.\n"}, {"page": "137", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nb.\nWOOD SIDING AND WOOD SIMULATION MATERIALS\ni.\nLap siding (horizontal) configuration\nii.\nSmooth or rough-sawn finish (no faux wood grain)\nc.\nBRICK, BLOCK AND STONE.

Roofs and parapets should demonstrate a commonsense recognition of the\nclimate by utilizing appropriate pitch, drainage, and materials in order to provide visual coherence\nto the Station Area. The design standards for roofs and parapets are as follows:\na.\nROOF MATERIALS. The following materials are permitted.\nb.\nParapets shall generally not extend above the top of a flat or single pitch (shed) roof more\nthan six feet (6') )fronting a public street. Parapets may be used to visually screen roof-top\nmechanical equipment, and a utilitarian penthouse structure may be attached to the interior\nside of a parapet extension in order to screen equipment. Parapets shall appear from the\nexterior as part of the exterior wall, and as such shall be composed of the same materials\nand limited to the same colors and finishes as the materials of the exterior walls. When a\nparapet also serves as a security railing for any activity on a rooftop, a parapet not facing a\npublic street may incorporate different materials than the exterior wall from which it\nextends, such as glass, metal mesh, and poles. When a parapet faces a public street and\nalso serves as a security railing for a rooftop activity, such as a green roof or open air\ndining, then the parapet may be designed such that it has openings in its vertical surface to\nallow visibility through it. Such openings shall not be lower than three feet (3') from the\nroof surface nor exceed eighteen inches (18\") in width.\n5.\nCONFIGURATIONS AND TECHNIQUES. The following configurations and techniques are permitted:\na.\nPITCHED ROOFS. Pitch is exclusive of roofs concealed behind parapets.\ni.\nSimple hip and gable roofs shall be symmetrically pitched between 4:12 and\n10:12.\nii.\nShed roofs, attached to the main structure, shall be pitched between 3:12 and 8:12.\niii.\nEaves, when provided, must overhang eighteen (18) to thirty inches (30\") on a\nprincipal building for the initial four (4) stories. For each additional story; six\ninches (6\") shall be added to the minimum and twelve inches (12\") shall be added\nto the maximum, up to a maximum projection of seven feet (7').\niv.\nEaves on accessory buildings, dormers, and other smaller structures must\noverhang at least eight inches (8\").\nV.\nTimber leaves and balcony brackets must be a minimum of four-by-four inches\n(4\" X 4\") in dimension.\nb.\nPARAPET, CORNICE AND COPING STANDARDS.\ni.\nAllowed only for sites where the roof material is not visible from any adjacent\nstreet.\nii.\nBuildings without visible roof surfaces and overhanging leaves may create an\noverhang with a cornice projecting horizontally between six (6\") and twelve\ninches (12\") beyond the building walls for the on the primary structure for the\nPage 5 49\nCELL (1, 1): \ni.\nCELL (1, 2): \nClay or concrete (faux clay)\nCELL (2, 1): \nii.\nCELL (2, 2): \nTile (barrel or flat roman)\nCELL (3, 1): \niii.\nCELL (3, 2): \nSlate (equivalent synthetic or better)\nCELL (4, 1): \niv.\nCELL (4, 2): \nMetal (standing seam, equivalent or better)\nCELL (5, 1): \nV.\nCELL (5, 2): \nDimensional Asphalt shingles\nCELL (6, 1): \nvi.\nCELL (6, 2): \nCedar Shingles\nCELL (7, 1): \nvii.\nCELL (7, 2): \nCornices and soffits may be a combination of wood, vinyl, and/or metal.\n"}, {"page": "138", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ninitial four (4) stories. For each additional story; six inches (6\") shall be added to\nthe minimum and twelve inches (12\") shall be added to the maximum, up to a\nmaximum projection of six feet (6').\niii.\nSKYLIGHTS, ROOF VENTS, MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT, AND SIMILAR UTILITARIAN\nITEMS. Skylights, roof vents, stacks, mechanical equipment, plumbing apparatus\nfor green roofs, and other mechanical or utility equipment with permanent\nplacement on the roof of a building shall be screened from view from any public\nstreet or public use area. Screening may be accomplished by parapet walls,\nutilitarian penthouse structures attached to the interior of a parapet extension,\nequipment covers, or similar. These items may also be set back from the edge of\na building at least ten feet (10') and camouflaged by color matching the roof when\nthey do not exceed two feet (2') in height.\n6.\nWINDOWS AND DOORS. The placement, type, and size of windows and doors help to establish the\nscale and vitality of the public realm. For nonresidential and mixed use buildings, they allow\ninterplay between the business interiors and the street or public realm space. For residential\nbuildings, they foster \"eyes on the street\" surveillance which provides for security and safety in the\narea. Windows should be divided by multiple panes of glass. This helps the window \"hold\" the\nsurface of the fa\u00e7ade, rather than appearing like a \"hole\" in the wall, an effect produced by a large\nsingle sheet of glass. The standards for windows and doors are as follows:\na.\nWindows shall be of anodized aluminum, wood, clad wood, vinyl, or steel.\nb.\nWindow glass shall be clear or lightly-tinted and non-reflective, with light transmission at\nthe ground story at least ninety percent (90%) and for the upper stories at least seventy five\npercent (75%), with modification as necessary to meet any applicable building and energy\ncode requirements.\nC.\nSpecialty windows, with a maximum of one per thirty (30) lineal feet along any fa\u00e7ade\nfacing any public street or public use realm, per story is allowed. A specialty window may\nutilize stained, opalescent, or translucent glass, or glass block, and shall not exceed forty\neight (48) square feet in area. Mirrored glass shall not be used on any ground story fa\u00e7ade\nor on any story when visible from any public street or public use realm.\nd.\nOperable windows and doors onto patios and balconies are allowed for residential units on\nany story, and for nonresidential and mixed use buildings above the ground story.\ne.\nWindow screens shall be black or gray. Screen frames shall match window frame material\nor be dark anodized.\nf.\nDoors designed primarily for pedestrian use shall be of wood, clad wood, or steel and may\ninclude glass panes. Doors designed for vehicular use may be of any material and style\nconsistent with the architectural detail of the building.\n7.\nCONFIGURATIONS AND TECHNIQUES FOR DOORS AND WINDOWS. The following are permitted:\na.\nThe horizontal dimension of the opening shall not exceed the vertical dimension except\nwhere otherwise prescribed in this Title.\nb.\nWindows may be ganged horizontally (maximum five [5] per group) if each grouping is\nseparated by a mullion, column, pier or wall section that is at least seven inches (7\") wide.\nc.\nWindows shall be no closer than thirty inches (30\") to building corners (excluding bay\nwindows).\nd.\nExterior shutters, if applied, shall be sized and mounted appropriately for the window at\none-half the width, even if inoperable.\ne.\nWindows on any story above the ground story may be double-hung, single-hung, awning,\nor casement windows. Fixed windows are permitted only as specialty windows or when a\ncomponent of a system including an operable window within a single wall opening.\nf.\nResidential buildings or residential floors of mixed use buildings shall have panes of glass\nno larger than thirty six inches (36\") vertical by thirty inches (30\") horizontal. The\nmaximum pane size for office uses is forty eight inches (48\") vertical by forty (40\")\nhorizontal. When necessary to meet building codes for egress purposes windows may\nPage 5 50\n"}, {"page": "139", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nexceed the dimensions given here.\ng.\nNonresidential windows and doors at the street level shall not have individual panes of\nglass larger than eight feet (8') in height by four feet (4') wide.\nh.\nAll window pane surface area of ground story nonresidential buildings shall allow views\ninto the building interior for a depth of at least eight feet (8') where the interior space is\nretail, restaurant, office, or similar area accessible to the public. This shall not include\nrestrooms, or restricted employee-only accessed areas, such as a kitchen, inventory storage,\nor loading dock. Windows shall not be made opaque by window treatments except for\noperable sunscreen devices within the conditioned space.\ni.\nGarage doors or operable coverings over vehicle use (service/loading) wall openings shall\nnot face the primary public street unless they are set back from the building fa\u00e7ade and\nfrom the public right-of-way at least twenty feet (20').\nj.\nDouble-height entryways (those that span more than one [1] story) are not allowed.\nk.\nDoors shall not be recessed more than three feet (3') behind the shop-front windows and,\nin any case, shall have a clear view and path to a forty five degree (45\u00b0) angle past the\nperpendicular from each side of the door.\n1.\nArcades, awnings, and canopies are encouraged along the front of buildings facing public\nstreets and the public use realm.\n8.\nSIGNAGE. Signs within the TS district commercial frontages should be clear, informative to the\npublic and should weather well. Signage is desirable for advertising shops and offices, and as\ndecoration. Signs should be scaled to the nature of the district, which is a mixed-use, pedestrian-\noriented environment centered by a heavily trafficked motor vehicle corridor. Signage that is glaring\nor too large creates distraction, intrudes into and lessens the urban environment pedestrian\nexperience, and creates visual clutter. The standards for signs are as follows:\na.\nWhere a building is designed to house multiple businesses or uses, each capable of desiring\nidentification signage, the building shall provide a master sign plan prior to receiving a\nCertificate of Occupancy. The master sign plan shall be reviewed and approved by the\nTown Board of Commissioners as provided at \u00a7 155.608.9. It shall include a designated\nhorizontal sign band for all uses on the ground or street level story, and designated locations\nfor identification of businesses in upper level stories and for identifying the building name\nitself. The sign band for the ground story level shall not be higher than sixteen feet (16')\nor lower than nine feet (9') above the adjacent public sidewalk, street or public use realm.\nb.\nIndividual letters placed within the designated first floor sign band shall not exceed\neighteen inches (18\") in height or width and three inches (3\") in relief for any buildings\nplaced at, or within ten feet (10') of the adjacent public street. Company logos and other\nnon-word elements may be placed within the sign band. All words, logos, and related\nelements used within the sign band to identify a business shall be arranged SO that together\nthey fit within a rectangular area up to sixty (60) square feet per business enterprise.\nc.\nCompany logos or names may be placed or painted within ground floor or second story\noffice windows.\nd.\nAttached signs for buildings designed and used as a single business enterprise or a multi-\nfamily residential building:\ni.\nAny combination of letters, logos, and other elements shall be considered one (1)\nsign for any building up to sixty thousand (60,000) square feet GFA and/or up to\nthree (3) stories. This sign shall fit within a rectangular area not to exceed one\nhundred (100) square feet, and not to exceed ten feet (10') in height. This single\nsign is allowed per each building fa\u00e7ade that is at an eighty (80) or greater degree\nangle from an adjacent building fa\u00e7ade.\nii.\nAny combination of letters, logos, and other elements shall be considered one sign\nfor any building equal to or greater than sixty thousand (60,000) square feet GFA\nand more than three (3) stories. This sign shall fit within a rectangular area not to\nexceed two hundred fifty (250) square feet, and not to exceed sixteen feet (16') in\nheight.\nPage 5 51\n"}, {"page": "140", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ne.\nA masonry or bronze plaque bearing the building name may be placed in the building's\nparapet wall or under the leaves, and above the upper story windows. The building name\nidentification may alternatively be sculpted into the building fa\u00e7ade. Any such plaque or\nsculpted material shall not exceed eighteen (18) square feet and shall be limited to the\nfa\u00e7ade incorporating the primary pedestrian entrance. The building name may also be\ndisplayed on a separate masonry or bronze plaque or sculpted into the building wall\nmaterial at the ground story level and shall not exceed four (4) square feet.\nf.\nProjecting signs placed perpendicular to the building facade and identifying a business\nenterprise or residential use within the building may be placed within ten feet (10') of an\nassociated street level door in the designated first story sign band or on exterior walls of\nthe second story, not to exceed twenty four feet (24') in height. Projecting signs shall not\nexceed twenty four (24) square feet in area or extend further than four feet (4') from the\nfa\u00e7ade, and shall have a minimum of seven feet six inches (7'6\") clear height above any\nsidewalk, plaza, or public use realm.\ng.\nBecause all buildings are expected to be at or close to the public street, sidewalk, or a public\nuse realm, no freestanding signs are anticipated for individual buildings. Freestanding\nsigns may be employed as gateway identification markers to various subareas at the\nexterior boundaries of and within the TS District as locations are determined by the\napproved general concept plan.\n9.\nAWNINGS AND CANOPIES: When an awning or canopy is incorporated into a building, the following\nrequirements shall apply:\na.\nA minimum of ten feet (10') clear height shall be provided for any awning or canopy above\nany sidewalk, plaza, or public use realm.\nb.\nAwnings may extend from the front fa\u00e7ade of the building up to one-half (1/2) of the width\nof the sidewalk area below, not to exceed nine feet (9'), whichever is less. If this extension\nreaches into the public right-of-way, an encroachment agreement with the Town or State\nis required. In no case shall an awning interfere with the placement, natural growth, and\nmaintenance of any street trees, street signs, or lighting.\nc.\nCanopies may extend from the front fa\u00e7ade of the building up to the full width of the\nsidewalk area below. If this extension reaches into the public right-of-way, an\nencroachment agreement from the Town or State is required. In no case shall a canopy\ninterfere with the placement, natural growth, and maintenance of any street trees, street\nsigns, or lighting.\nd.\nAwnings may be made of canvas or treated canvas material, may be designed to retract\nagainst the wall of the building, and shall not include any shiny or reflective materials.\ne.\nCanopies may be made of wood, metal, or glass, or a combination of these or similar\npermanent rigid materials, and shall not include any shiny or reflective materials.\nf.\nNo internal illumination shall be projected through an awning or canopy.\n10.\nMECHANICAL EQUIPMENT AND STORAGE ITEMS. The following shall be placed behind\nand away from any front or corner side building line, not be stored or located within any street, and\nbe screened from view from the public use realm:\na.\nAir compressors, mechanical pumps, exterior water heaters, water softeners, utility and\ntelephone company transformers, meters or boxes, storage tanks, garbage dumpsters and\ncompressors, and similar equipment shall not be installed or placed within any area\nconsidered public use realm.\nb.\nBackflow preventers as required by the public utility company shall not be located within\nthe public use realm, and shall be covered or screened from view.\nc.\nGarbage and recycling containers, and similar items which must be stored and then moved\non an ongoing schedule for servicing shall be stored in a location that is completely\nscreened from view from the public realm to a minimum height of six feet (6') through the\nuse of a fence, wall, or other visual block.\nd.\nUtility meters for individual residential or nonresidential uses that are installed on or near\nPage 5 52\n"}, {"page": "141", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\na building wall and must be regularly accessed for data collection shall be screened from\nview from the public realm through the use of a fence, wall, evergreen landscape materials,\nor other visual block.\ne.\nRoof mounted equipment shall be placed behind and away from any front or corner side\nbuilding line and be screened from view from the public realm.\nH.\nFLEXIBLE DESIGN. The TS district establishes minimum standards for development and design. Those\nstandards however may not always be appropriate to a particular segment or building within the development.\nAccordingly, new development concepts, innovative design, unique circumstances or public/private ventures\nmay require the use of alternative development or design standards. In such cases, the development\nrequirements specified here for the TS district (in \u00a7 155.503.6) may be modified through the Flexible Design\nprovisions of \u00a7 155.401.7 of this Title.\n155.503.7.\nShopping Center District (B-1SCD)\nA.\nThe Shopping Center District is established to provide for the development and efficient operation of\nintegrated shopping centers or retail sales establishments which exceed one hundred thousand (100,000)\nsquare feet of total floor area. \"Retail\" for this district shall include predominately the sale of merchandise\nand prepared food and drink. This district requires locations with easy vehicular access and high visibility\nto draw visitors from a wide geographic area, while providing adequate treatment of district edges to ensure\nthese developments are not detrimental to adjacent uses or the orderly and well-planned development of the\ncommunity. All development of land within the Shopping Center district shall comply with a site plan\napproved at the time of district designation. The Shopping Center District is primarily intended for properties\nthat already have been developed as predominately or exclusively retail complexes. Where new sites are\nconsidered for this zoning district, it is anticipated they will be designed with multi-story structures and be\nlocated in conjunction with higher density residential and mixed use developments. The map symbol and\nshort name for the Shopping Center District shall be \"B-1SCD\".\nB.\nLot development and design standards, as outlined in \u00a7 155.605, and dimensional standards of \u00a7 155.604.3,\napply to the B-1SCD District.

All streets must be dedicated to the public,\nalthough alleys may be private.\ng.\nALLEYS AND SERVICE ACCESS. A clearly-defined network of rear and side alleys is\nencouraged to provide vehicular access to off-street parking and service/loading facilities\nfor individual buildings. Alley entrances should generally align SO as to provide ease of\ningress for service vehicles, but internal deflections or variations in the alley network are\nencouraged to prevent excessive or monotonous views of the rear of structures resulting\nfrom long stretches of alleys. All alleys shall be identified as either public or private, and\nany public alley shall be dedicated to the public as provided for in Chapter 7.\nh.\nTHE STREETSCAPE. A thematic and cohesive streetscape planting and lighting plan shall\nPage 5 54\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nbe prepared for the B-1SCD district at time of initial designation. The streetscape plan\nshall incorporate street trees to provide both form (canopy) and comfort (shade) to the\nstreet. Street trees give special character and coherence to each street. Lighting shall be\nincorporated to provide night-time illumination under the tree canopy for safety and\nambiance for pedestrians, and adequate illumination for vehicular traffic.\ni.\nFRONTS AND REARS. Building facades are the public \"face\" of every building. Owners and\noccupants are encouraged to utilize planters and window boxes filled with colorful plants\nalong each fa\u00e7ade that fronts a public street, plaza, parking lot, or similar public use realm.\n3.\nBLOCKS. When a B-1SCD designation will create new streets or extend streets, the block lengths\nshall meet the standards provided in Chapter 7.\n4.\nPARKING. While public street cross sections may include on-street parking, a substantial amount of\nrequired parking will need to be provided on private property, generally require on the same parcel\nas the associated.\na.\nLOCATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING. Off-street parking spaces must be located on the\nsame parcel as the associated use, except where shared parking as outlined in this\nsubsection is involved. In no case may required minimum parking be located in the\ntransitional setback or yard of arterial streets subject to future expansion. Parking shall not\nbe located within the streetscape planting area adjacent to any street, or a required perimeter\nplanting area or landscape screening area at the outer edge of a property. Access to off-\nstreet parking shall be provided by private driveways or shared alleys. Parking along alleys\nis allowed, may be at ninety degree (90\u00b0), angled, or parallel, and must be of sufficient\ndepth to assure parked vehicles will not impede traffic movement in the alley. Where ninety\ndegree (90\u00b0), or angled spaces are provided, they must be a minimum of twenty feet (20')\nin length, and where parallel spaces are provided they must be a minimum of eight feet (8')\nin width. Any alley with parking spaces immediately adjacent must be paved a minimum\nof twenty feet (20') in width, with no obstructions such as doors, dumpsters, planters,\nbollards, mechanical equipment, street light poles, etc., that could restrict the full width use\nof the pavement for vehicular maneuvering in and out of designated parking spaces. Cross\naccess is required between adjoining parking lots.\nb.\nSHARED PARKING.\ni.\nShared location of cumulative required spaces. Owners and developers are\nencouraged to design a shared parking system for part or all of a B-1SCD district\nin shared parking lots or structures. A written agreement between property\nowners explaining what parcel or parcels shall utilize shared parking, and which\nwill remain binding on future owners and land uses, shall be signed and recorded\nwith the Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds office.\nii.\nShared use of same spaces. Shared parking of required parking spaces may be\npermitted with approval from the Planning Director as provided in \u00a7\n155.607.2.G.6 of this Title.\nc.\nPARKING STRUCTURES. Parking structures are encouraged to create shared parking\nopportunities and to reduce the footprint of surface lots. Single-use parking structures must\nbe located behind other buildings or internal to the district. Structured parking is permitted\nand encouraged in mixed use buildings. Structured parking may extend below grade and\nmay contain multiple levels of parking above grade. Parking structures may contain other\nuses above the parking levels provided the entire building does not exceed the height\nallowed in the B-1SCD district. Partially enclosed parking spaces may be created with\nhabitable space cantilevered over them at the rear of a building, or along the side of a\nbuilding when a solid wall blocks view of parked vehicles from any public street or\npedestrian pathway.\nG.\nBUILDING DESIGN GUIDELINES.\n1.\nGENERAL BUILDING DESIGN PRINCIPLES.

Due to the nature of the Sportsplex as a public park, density and structural build-\nout related criteria included below would not logically apply to the Sportsplex portion of the overall\nneighborhood. Where such urban design standards would conflict with the open space and protected forested\nportions within the public Sportsplex itself, they shall not apply within the Sportplex portion of the overall\nneighborhood, and the specific design criteria of the approved park plans shall prevail.\n"}, {"page": "149", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n1.\nLOCATION. The ENT District shall only be applied within the geographic area designated by\nMatthews Board of Commissioners as the regional Sportsplex and adjacent new mixed use\nneighborhood. This area is roughly bounded by Matthews-Mint Hill Road, Independence\nBoulevard, I-485, and Tank Town Road/Crestdale neighborhood.\n2.\nEXTERIOR PROJECT EDGE. The ENT District is established to provide and enhance both daily\nliving activities and recreational opportunities for local residents and visitors within a distinct and\nlimited geographic area, as well as enabling easy and logical connections to surrounding and nearby\ndevelopment. Therefore, clearly defined gateway entrances to the ENT neighborhood are\nappropriate. All development within the ENT district and along Matthews-Mint Hill Road frontage\nshall be designed to be visually complementary to existing or planned development across the street.\nAll development within the ENT District and adjacent to the Crestdale neighborhood shall be\ndesigned to be visually complementary and shall incorporate uses that do not adversely impact the\npredominantly residential nature of the Crestdale community. Height and bulk of buildings shall be\ndesigned SO they do not visually overwhelm adjacent single story scale development. This may be\naccomplished through stepped back building heights, relatively narrow building extensions toward\nthe adjacent properties, landscaped buffers, greenway trails, public plazas, and/or other design\nelements.\n3.\nOVERALL ARCHITECTURAL THEME AND DESIGN. Because the ENT District creates an\nopportunity for a concentrated location of development unlike any other site within the Town, an\noverall set of architectural elements and site design amenities to \"brand\" the area may be\nappropriate. The specific elements shall be determined by the Town Board of Commissioners prior\nto construction of any buildings or improvements. Details may include specific exterior building\nmaterials to be incorporated within structures, maximum dimensions of surface parking lots, street\nlighting and other street furniture, landscape species and hardscape elements, placement of public\nart, gateway and internal directory signage design, greenway and pedestrian trail cross sections,\nmandatory inclusion/location of pedestrian connectivity, street cross sections, and similar public\narea amenities that may benefit from being internally consistent. Exterior boundary pedestrian\namenities extending to surrounding locations may also be incorporated into the required design\nthemes for the ENT District.\nD.\nEARLY DESIGNATION PROCESS. Where a parcel has received designation of ENT district prior to a full\ndevelopment proposal on it, as outlined at \u00a7 155.501.3.I, sufficient drawings and documents to clearly prove\ncompliance to the design elements listed in \u00a7 155.503.8.E through G below shall be submitted to the\nMatthews Planning Office for review and recommendation in the same way as a rezoning application is\nhandled by Town staff. Upon completion of review, Town staff and applicants shall meet to review staff\nfindings. Applicants shall provide additional or revised documents as determined necessary to show\ncompliance to all standards. Submission of a request for site plan and/or elevation plan approval shall then\nbe forwarded to the Matthews Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners shall receive a report\nwith recommendations from Town Planning staff on how well the proposal meets the intent of the district\nand the design criteria listed below, and determine when the proposal meets the requirements and can be\napproved.\nE.\nREVIEW CRITERIA. Proposals for development in the ENT District shall be approved only if they conform to\nthe adopted overall concept plan for the area and incorporate adopted desired elements of a mixed use\nentertainment focused neighborhood, including:\n1.\nA highly interconnected street network, dispersing traffic while providing safe and convenient\nroutes for pedestrians and bicyclists.\n2.\nHigh-quality public spaces, with all building facades which face such public spaces having windows\nand doors facing tree-lined streets, plazas, squares, or neighborhood parks.\n3.\nCompact development, creating a walkable urban environment and conserving land and energy\nthrough reduced automobile usage and advanced techniques such as stormwater infiltration.\n4.\nDiversity not homogeneity, with a variety of building types, street types, open spaces, and land uses\nproviding for people of all ages and every form of mobility.\n5.\nResilient and sustainable mix of residential, business, service, and recreational land uses that will\nbe adaptable over time to improved public transit and to changing economic conditions.\n6.\nVertical and horizontal mix of uses to maximize the opportunities for a safe and active\nPage 5 61\n"}, {"page": "150", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nneighborhood.\n7.\nParking plans that address both short-term and long-term needs, with strategies for future shared\nstructured parking within the overall neighborhood.

While public street cross sections should include on-street parking on\nmany streets within the overall neighborhood, the majority of required parking spaces will be\nprovided on private property, either on the same parcel as the associated use or on a nearby parcel.\na.\nSHARED PARKING PROGRAM. An owner/developer is expected to design and implement a\npark-once system of shared parking to distribute the commercial parking load between on-\nstreet spaces and shared parking lots or structures. In order to reduce the amount of\nseparate surface parking lots which can visually and spatially dominate development and\ntherefore adversely affect desired density of build-out, vehicle parking shall have both a\nshort-term and a long-term plan. Any development project proposed in the ENT District\nshall show how it can provide for its share of parking needs when initially constructed, as\nwell as a longer-term future demand. Off-site parking within shared parking facilities shall\nbe allowed and is encouraged in order to increase building and/or public use coverage\nfronting streets within the district. At the time of initial approval, a development proposal\nshall identify whether the project will include one or more of the following, either upon\ninitial construction or at a later phase: twenty (20) or more residential units; six thousand\n(6,000) square feet or more of business or retail space; fifty (50) or more seating\naccommodations in a restaurant; or any public assembly or recreational use facility that can\naccommodate fifty (50) or more persons (participants or attendees). Any proposed\ndevelopment meeting any of the given categories shall agree to participation in the\nneighborhood-wide shared parking program. This shared parking program may allow\nmultiple separate buildings or development projects to allocate a certain percentage of their\nrequired parking to a shared off-site parking facility, and may require property owners to\nparticipate in a special assessment process to build structured parking when certain\nneighborhood build-out levels are reached. Shared off-site parking facilities may initially\nbe surface lots that shall be converted to structured parking when neighborhood density\nlevels are reached. A written agreement between property owners explaining what parcel\nor parcels may utilize parking on a separate parcel, now and/or in the future, and which\nwill remain binding on future owners and land uses, shall be signed and recorded with the\nMecklenburg County Register of Deeds office prior to any land disturbing activity or any\npermit being issued for a parcel that requires off-site parking to meet minimum parking\nstandards.\nb.\nTo the maximum extent possible, off-street parking spaces must be located within buildings\nor behind buildings SO that buildings screen parking areas from sidewalks and streets. In\nno case shall parking be located in the setback or yard in front of a building. Parking lots\nin non-streetside (interior of block) side yards may be allowed provided these lots are\nplaced a minimum of twenty feet (20') from lot lines adjoining rights-of-way, excluding\nalleys.\nC.\nAccess to off-street parking spaces shall be provided by one- or two-way private drives or\nPage 5 63\nCELL (1, 1): \ni.\nCELL (1, 2): \nThe block has at least one block face on a numbered state or federal highway or\nexpressway/freeway.\nCELL (2, 1): \nii.\nCELL (2, 2): \nThe block has at least a portion of its block face partially within the Sportsplex\npublic park property.\nCELL (3, 1): \niii.\nCELL (3, 2): \nThe block face contains valuable natural features which should not be crossed by\na street.\nCELL (4, 1): \niv.\nCELL (4, 2): \nThe block face cannot have buildings on one side due to utility easement\nrestrictions.\n"}, {"page": "152", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\npublic alleys. Parking spaces immediately adjacent to drives or alleys may be ninety degree\n(90\u00b0), angled, or parallel, and must be of sufficient depth to assure parked vehicles will not\nimpede traffic movement in the drive or alley. Where ninety degree (90\u00b0) or angle spaces\nare provided, they must be a minimum of twenty feet (20') in length, and where parallel\nspaces are provided they must be a minimum of eight feet (8') in width. Any drive or alley\nwith parking spaces immediately adjacent must be paved a minimum of twenty feet (20')\nin width, with no obstructions, such as doors, dumpsters, planters, bollards, mechanical\nequipment, street light poles, etc., that could restrict the full width use of the pavement for\nvehicular maneuvering in and out of the designated parking spaces. Cross access is\nrequired between adjoining rear/side parking lots.\nd.\nParking structures are encouraged to create shared parking opportunities and to reduce the\nfootprint of surface lots. Single-use parking structures must be located behind other\nbuildings. Structured parking is permitted and encouraged on liner buildings and mixed\nuse buildings. Structured parking may extend below grade and may contain multiple levels\nof parking above grade. Parking structures may contain other uses above the parking levels\nprovided the entire building does not exceed the height allowed in the ENT District.\nPartially enclosed parking spaces may be created with habitable space cantilevered over\nthem at the rear of a building, or along the side of a building when a solid wall blocks view\nof parked vehicles from any public street or pedestrian pathway.\n5.\nUSES UNABLE TO UTILIZE STOREFRONT FENESTRATION. When certain uses such as a\ntheater, parking, or planetarium cannot comply with the required door and window standards for\nprimary facades, then they may be constructed in a manner that they will be separated from adjacent\nstreets (but not alleys) by liner buildings. Liner buildings:\na.\nMust be at least two stories in height with not less than twenty feet (20') in depth.\nb.\nMay be detached from or attached to the building(s) they are concealing.\nc.\nMay be used for any purpose allowed on the lot on which they are located except for\nparking.\nd.\nMust meet the primary fa\u00e7ade transparency requirements in \u00a7 155.503.8.G. below.\n6.\nWIDE BUILDINGS. When a wide building is placed directly across a street from substantially\nnarrower lots or buildings, the principal fa\u00e7ade of wide buildings must be varied with a change of\narchitectural expression that reflects the widths of the narrower lots. These changes in expression\nmay be a vertical element running from the sidewalk to the roof, a change in fenestration or style,\ncolor, or texture, or a break in fa\u00e7ade plane or roof line. These changes must be of sufficient visual\nimpact to soften the perception of a single wide building.\n7.\nBUILDING STORIES AND STORY HEIGHT. All buildings shall be a minimum of two (2) stories\nin height within the ENT District, except when a single story structure has a ground floor at least\ntwenty feet (20') tall. The ground story of nonresidential and mixed use buildings shall be from\ntwelve (12') to eighteen feet (18') tall. The ground floor of residential buildings shall be a minimum\nof ten feet (10') tall. Each story above the ground floor in residential, nonresidential, and mixed use\nbuildings shall be at least eight feet (8') tall. Story heights are measured from the floor to the bottom\nof the lowest structural member that supports the story above.\n8.\nFIRST FLOOR ELEVATION ENTRANCES. Nonresidential and mixed use buildings shall have\ntheir primary public walk-in entrances level with, to no greater than six inches (6\") above, the\nadjacent public walkway. When a nonresidential or mixed use building has more than one (1)\nprimary public entrance and has more than a one foot (1') difference in finished grade at the various\ndoorways, then the entrance adjacent to a public street shall meet this requirement. Residential\nbuildings shall have their first habitable story at least eighteen inches (18\") above the adjacent public\nwalkway. Residential buildings with multiple doors shall meet this height standard for doorways\nfacing public streets. Exceptions may be allowed through a site plan review, when a written\nexplanation is provided to indicate the basis for alternate design.\nG.\nBUILDING AND STRUCTURE DESIGN PRINCIPLES.\n1.\nGENERAL BUILDING DESIGN PRINCIPLES. These principles favor an aesthetic that allows a\ncontemporary influence within a more traditional framework. They call for a determination of an\nPage 5 64\n"}, {"page": "153", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\noverall visual or architectural theme and selection of exterior materials that are appropriate for the\nregion. Structures may exhibit unique details and should not utilize a standard or corporate facade\nthat is repeated, or intended to be repeated, in multiple communities. While structures within the\nENT district may be initially built to house a specific use, the buildings shall be designed to\naccommodate future alternative uses. These building design principles concentrate on the views\nfrom the public realm, including public streets, public sidewalks or walkways, parks, plazas, civic\ngreens, squares, and unrestricted parking areas (those not reserved solely for residents/employees).\nThe general building design principles listed at \u00a7 155.603 shall be utilized when designing any site\nwithin the ENT district. While only materials, techniques, and product types are prescribed here,\nequivalent or better practices and products are encouraged when appropriate. When requested, they\nmust be submitted to the Town Planning office either for Administrative Amendment as explained\nat 155.401.5 or Flexible Design as explained at \u00a7 155.401.7., whichever applies.\n2.\nEXTERIOR BUILDING WALLS. Exterior walls of buildings shall generally reflect a unified\ndesign and set of materials (all-sided architecture). They should express the construction techniques\nand structural constraints to assure long-lasting buildings. Extensive use of glass or glazing,\nparticularly at ground floor level and facing any public use areas is strongly encouraged and\nexpected.\na.\nPrimary materials, which shall cover at least sixty percent (60%) of each fa\u00e7ade, excluding\nany glazed areas, shall consist of brick, other masonry, native stone or synthetic equivalent,\nor cementicious materials with a distinct dimensional surface.\nb.\nSecondary materials, which may cover up to forty percent (40%) of each fa\u00e7ade excluding\nany glazed areas, may include hardiboard siding, wood siding, stucco, and metal.\nc.\nAccent materials and trim may cover up to ten percent (10%) of each fa\u00e7ade excluding any\nglazed areas. Such accents and trim materials shall be identified on elevation plans.\nd.\nColors of all non-glazing exterior materials on any building shall be limited to no more\nthan three, unless the building is both larger in overall size than sixty thousand (60,000)\nsquare feet and at least three (3) stories in height. Such larger buildings may employ up to\nfive (5) distinct colors on its exterior facades. For the purpose of this standard, the term\ncolor shall also refer to two (2) clearly different shades of the same color, such as a light\ngreen and a dark green, or a pastel pink and a burgundy red.\ne.\nAlternative percentages of listed materials or types of materials may be requested by the\nFlexible Design Provisions at \u00a7 155.503.8.H. at the time of initial district designation, or\nthrough the Administrative Amendment process for an individual building after it has\nreceived site plan and elevation plan approval.\n3.\nCONFIGURATIONS AND TECHNIQUES FOR EXTERIOR WALLS. The following\nare\npermitted:\na.\nDOORWAYS AND WALL OPENINGS.\ni.\nPedestrian use doors to nonresidential uses from a public street shall not be\nrecessed more than three feet (3') behind the building fa\u00e7ade and shall have a clear\nview and path to a forty five degree (45\u00b0) angle past the perpendicular from each\nside of the door.\nii.\nThe horizontal dimension of a door or wall opening shall not exceed the vertical\ndimension except where required for a specific purpose such as loading, or vehicle\nentrance/exit. When a wall opening has its horizontal dimension exceeding its\nvertical measurement, it shall not directly face a public pedestrian use area.\nWhere a garage door or vehicular service opening with an operable covering is\nlocated, the garage door or covering shall be recessed at least two feet (2') in from\nthe vertical plane of the surrounding wall.\niii.\nDoorways and wall openings shall not span vertically more than one (1) story.\niv.\nDoorways and wall openings shall correspond to interior space.\nV.\nChanges from one material to another shall have a logical placement from a\nconstruction viewpoint, SO that the placement of a separate material is visually\nand structurally appropriate.\nPage 5 65\n"}, {"page": "154", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nb.\nWOOD AND WOOD-LOOK.\ni.\nHorizontal lap siding of wood or simulated wood material is allowed.\nii.\nWood or wood-look products used as an exterior wall covering and placed in any\nother configuration than horizontal lap siding shall be identified on elevation\nplans.\niii.\nWood or wood-look products may have a smooth or rough-sawn appearance.\nc.\nBrick, other masonry, and stone must be used in an appropriate load-bearing configuration.\nGenerally heavier masonry and stone materials shall be utilized at the base of a building\nand support lighter-weight materials such as wood. All masonry materials shall have a\ndistinct dimensional surface.\nd.\nStucco and other cementicous finish materials may be rough or sand finish, but shall have\na distinct dimensional surface.\ne.\nMetal materials may have a smooth or flat finish, and may be protected to preserve a shine\nor satin appearance, or may be intended to weather to a dull finish. Metal materials may\nalso have a three-dimensional surface with embossing or sculptural elements embedded\nwithin it.\nf.\nAny requested deviations from these standards for exterior walls shall be submitted for\nconsideration during the elevation plan approval process. If the elevation plan has been\napproved and a building permit has been issued, a request for Administrative Amendment\nmay be submitted which shall automatically require Town Board final determination.\n4.\nROOFS AND PARAPETS. Roofs and parapets should demonstrate a commonsense recognition of\nthe climate by utilizing appropriate pitch, drainage, color, and materials in order to provide visual\ncoherence to the district's overall aesthetic theme. Specific design standards for roofs and parapets\nare as follows:\na.\nROOF MATERIALS. The following roofing materials are permitted:\nb.\nParapets shall generally not extend above the top of a flat or single pitch (shed) roof more\nthan six feet (6') fronting a public street. Parapets may be used to visually screen roof-top\nmechanical equipment, and a utilitarian penthouse structure may be attached to the interior\nside of a parapet extension in order to screen equipment. Parapets shall appear from the\nexterior as part of the exterior wall, and as such shall be composed of the same materials\nand limited to the same colors and finishes as the materials of the exterior walls. When a\nparapet also serves as a security railing for any activity on a rooftop, a parapet not facing a\npublic street may incorporate different materials than the exterior wall from which it\nextends, such as glass, metal mesh, and poles. When a parapet faces a public street and\nalso serves as a security railing for a rooftop activity, such as a green roof or open air\ndining, then the parapet may be designed such that it has openings in its vertical surface to\nallow visibility through it. Such openings shall not be lower than three feet (3') from the\nroof surface nor exceed eighteen inches (18\") in width.\n5.\nCONFIGURATIONS AND TECHNIQUES FOR ROOFS AND PARAPETS. The following are\npermitted:\na.\nPITCHED ROOFS. Pitch is exclusive of roofs concealed behind parapets.\nPage 5 66\nCELL (1, 1): \ni.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional asphalt shingles.\nCELL (2, 1): \nii.\nCELL (2, 2): \nCedar shingles.\nCELL (3, 1): \niii.\nCELL (3, 2): \nMetal - standing seam, equivalent or better.\nCELL (4, 1): \niv.\nCELL (4, 2): \nSlate - natural, synthetic equivalent or better.\nCELL (5, 1): \nV.\nCELL (5, 2): \nTile.\nCELL (6, 1): \nvi.\nCELL (6, 2): \nClay, natural or faux, or concrete.\nCELL (7, 1): \nvii.\nCELL (7, 2): \nCornices and soffits may be a combination of wood vinyl, and/or metal.\nCELL (8, 1): \nviii.\nCELL (8, 2): \nAlternative \"green roof\" materials that provide adequate support for live\nplantings and surrounding walking/maintenance space are encouraged.\n"}, {"page": "155", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ni.\nSimple hip and gable roofs shall be symmetrically pitched between 4:12 and\n10:12.\nii.\nSingle pitch shed roofs, attached to the main structure, shall be pitched between\n3:12 and 8:12.\niii.\nEaves, when provided, must overhang eighteen (18) to thirty (30) inches on\na\nprincipal building for the initial four (4) stories.

The placement, type, and size of windows and doors help establish\nscale and vitality. For nonresidential and mixed use buildings, they allow interplay between\nbusiness interior and the adjacent street or public realm space. For residential buildings, they foster\n\"eyes on the street\" surveillance which provides for security and safety in the vicinity. Windows\nshould be divided by multiple panes of glass. This helps retain the consistency of the vertical surface\nof the building fa\u00e7ade, rather than appearing like a \"hole\" in the wall, an effect which can be\nproduced by a large single sheet of glass. Standards are as follows:\na.\nWindows shall be of anodized aluminum, wood, clad wood, vinyl, or steel.\nb.\nWindow glass shall be clear or lightly-tinted and non-reflective, with light transmission at\nleast sixty percent (60%), with modification as necessary to meet any applicable building\nand energy code requirements.\nC.\nSpecialty windows, with a maximum of one per thirty (30) lineal feet along any fa\u00e7ade\nfacing any public street or public use realm, per story, is allowed. A specialty window may\nutilize stained, opalescent, or translucent glass, or glass block, and shall not exceed forty\neight (48) square feet in area. Mirrored glass shall not be used on any ground story fa\u00e7ade\nor on any story when visible from any public street or public use realm.\nd.\nOperable windows and doors onto patios or balconies are allowed for residential units on\nany story, and for nonresidential and mixed use buildings above the ground story.\ne.\nWindow screens shall be black or gray. Screen frames shall match window frame material\nor be dark anodized aluminum.\nPage 5 67\n"}, {"page": "156", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nf.\nDoors designed primarily for pedestrian use shall be of wood, clad wood, or steel and may\ninclude glass panes. Doors designed for vehicular use may be of any material and style\nconsistent with the architectural detail of the building.\n7.\nCONFIGURATIONS AND TECHNIQUES FOR DOORS AND WINDOWS. The following are\npermitted:\n8.\nSIGNAGE. Signs within the ENT Entertainment District should be clear and informative to the\npublic and should weather well. Signage should be scaled to the nature of the district, which is a\nmixed use, pedestrian-oriented environment with slower-moving vehicular traffic. Signage that is\nglaring or too large creates distraction, intrudes into and lessens the Entertainment District\nexperience, and creates visual clutter. In addition to the regulations in the Signs subchapter at \u00a7\n155.608, standards for signs in the ENT District are as follows:\na.\nWhere a building is designed to house multiple businesses or uses, each capable of desiring\nidentification signage:\ni.\nThe building shall provide a master sign plan prior to receiving a Certificate of\nOccupancy.

The ENT district establishes minimum standards for development and design. Those\nstandards however may not always be appropriate to a particular segment or building within the development.\nAccordingly, new development concepts, innovative design, unique circumstances or public/private ventures\nmay require the use of alternative development or design standards. In such cases, the development\nrequirements specified here for the ENT district (as shown in ENT section text above) may be modified\nthrough the Flexible Design provisions of \u00a7 155.401.7 of this Title.\n155.503.9.\nAdult Use District (AU)\nA.\nThe Adult Use District is established to provide areas in which adult entertainment or sexually oriented\nbusiness may be established. Adult establishments, because of their very nature, are recognized as having\nserious objectionable operational characteristics upon adjacent neighborhoods and residential or institutional\nuses. It has been demonstrated that the establishment of adult businesses often creates problems for law\nenforcement agencies, by the very nature of these businesses and the difficulty often experienced in trying to\ndetermine if the operations are of a legal nature. Special regulation of these establishments is necessary to\nensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to a de facto downgrading or blighting of surrounding\nneighborhoods and uses. It is the intent of this District to restrict the concentration of these uses and to\nseparate these uses from residential and institutional uses or areas. All development of land within the Adult\nUses district shall comply with a site plan approved at the time of district designation. The map symbol and\nshort name for the Adult Use District shall be \"AU\".

The Downtown Overlay District is established to implement the policies,\nrecommendations and standards of the Downtown Master Plan and any related adopted Design Guidelines\nand Streetscape which together create a framework for preserving, revitalizing, and expanding on the social,\ncultural and architectural heritage of the downtown area of the Town of Matthews. The Downtown Master\nPlan was developed after thorough study of the downtown's characteristics and its history. The Downtown\nOverlay District is created to continue to focus on the concentrated central business area of Matthews to\nprotect its unique position in the community, and to acknowledge the downtown's role in economic viability\nand general welfare of the Town as a whole. The historic downtown and its fringe areas are anticipated to\ndevelop and redevelop in the near future due to increased population and demand for more urban services\nnearby. The Downtown Overlay District includes both the existing historic core and proposed extensions of\nthe commercial hub in order to direct new expansion in a compatible development approach to the existing\nurban core. This district stresses sensitivity to the pedestrian environment; urban design; urban open space;\npedestrian scale signs, street furniture and amenities; and, urban landscaping in both the existing historic\nbusiness core and in fringe areas anticipated to receive development pressure/opportunities over time. The\nDowntown Master Plan is hereby adopted by reference. Development and improvement of property in the\nDowntown Overlay District shall comply with the requirements of \u00a7 155.504.1. The map symbol and short\nname for the Downtown Overlay District shall be \"DO District.\" [formerly known as \u00a7 153.064.A]\nB.\nDOWNTOWN OVERLAY DISTRICT. In addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s),\ndevelopment and improvements in the DO District shall comply with the following requirements, and where\nthe regulations in this Section are in conflict with the regulations of the underlying zoning district, the\nregulations in this Section shall prevail:\n1.\nPERMITTED USES. Permitted uses, uses permitted subject to specific conditions, and accessory uses\nwithin the DO District shall be determined by the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s).\n2.\nLive/work units are permitted in the DO District provided they comply with the requirements of \u00a7\n155.503.2.W\n3.\nAREA, YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS. Area, yard, and height regulations shall be determined by\nthe requirements of the underlying zoning district, except that:\na.\nCommunications antenna, wireless facility, or tower height within the DO District shall\nnot exceed thirty-five feet (35');\nb.\nOnly wireless stealth applications are allowed in the 100 block of N Trade Street because\nit\nis a designated National Historic Commercial District. These wireless facilities shall\ncomply with the requirements in \u00a7 155.506.41. (Am. Ord. 2280A, passed 2-12-18)\nC.\nForming the Unique Character of the Overlay District. The Downtown Master Plan provides general concepts\nand policies for future development in the downtown area. Design Guidelines and Streetscape Improvements,\nas may be amended from time to time, and adopted by the Board of Commissioners, are incorporated here\nby reference.\n1.\nCREATION OF STREETSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS. The relationship between a building and areas for\npedestrian or vehicular circulation must be carefully planned in order to avoid negative impacts of\none upon the other. The Downtown Master Plan illustrates design standards for the public rights-\nof-way for the majority of existing streets within the DO District. New streets shall be assigned a\nstreet type category as they are proposed, in order to assure consistency in development of the public\nrights-of-way. All buildings and uses developed in the DO District must meet the following\nPage 5 72\n"}, {"page": "161", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nminimum standards.\na.\nPAVING. Paving systems in the public rights of- way must conform to the standards of the\nDowntown Master Plan and/or adopted standards in Chapter 7 of this Title. The paving\nsystems used on private plazas, walkways, drives, and parking areas not in the public right-\nof-way may be different in color, material, and texture from those specified for public\nproperties. The paving systems must be of a compatible pattern and scale to provide a\ntransition into the paving system on public property.\nb.\nSTREET FURNITURE AND AMENITIES. Walking surfaces, street furniture, light fixtures,\ninformation signs, and kiosks constructed in the public right-of-way or required\nsetback/minimum build-to line must be consistent with the Downtown Master Plan.\nExterior lighting used on private plazas and walkways must be complementary in design\nmotif to that specified in the Streetscape Improvements.\nc.\nSTREET TREES. Street trees in public right-of-way shall be installed as properties are\ndeveloped or separate from adjacent private property activity in accordance with the\nDowntown Master Plan. Above ground planters shall not be used to fulfill the street tree\nrequirement. As new streets are proposed, the streetscape design shall be developed\nconsistent with the class of street type assigned to it.\n2.\nGENERAL URBAN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES. The harmonious relationship between\nland uses and their environment requires that certain areas be addressed during project planning.\nThese relationships deal with the streetscape, historic buildings and places, and open spaces.\nDevelopment or redevelopment subject to these provisions shall be built in accordance with the\nminimum urban design standards set forth in this Section. The purpose of this Section is to define\nthe minimum urban design standards for development in the DO District in order to preserve the\nsmall-town character while encouraging revitalization and expansion. It is not the intent or\nexpectation that new development should replicate a previous time period, but the general design\nprinciples in place when the majority of the current historic core was developed are being recreated\nhere for consistency in context for those buildings constructed between 1900 and 1940. The guiding\ngeneral principles are as follows:\na.\nBuildings should address the street.\ni.\nEntrances should face the street and be accessible from the sidewalk via an\noperable door designed SO that it functions as a primary entrance to the building.\nii.\nSite layout should place the building generally at or near the front of the lot as\nindicated in the Streetscape Improvements, with parking to the side and/or rear of\nthe building.\nb.\nBuildings should be designed to be compatible with the context of the neighborhood.\ni.\nScale of new buildings should be in harmony with existing structures.\nii.\nMaterials, colors, and styles should be compatible with existing structures.\nc.\nBuilding styles should be traditional, or styles adapted from local and regional\ninterpretations of traditional architecture\ni.\nBuilding style should be appropriate to the intended use.\nii.\nChoice of building materials, elements, and details should be consistent with\nchosen architectural style. Elements that are obviously of another style should be\navoided.\nd.\nOverall design, use of materials, and ornamentation should be kept simple and in harmony\nwith the scale of the building. Additional illustrative detail on how urban design standards\nmay be satisfied is provided in the Downtown Master Plan.\n3.\nSTRUCTURE DESIGN GUIDELINES\na.\nBUILD-TO LINES REQUIRED. Build-to lines are established for most existing streets in the\nDO District. As new streets are proposed, they will be assigned a street type category and\nbuild-to lines shall be assigned. Any new construction in the 100 block of North Trade\nStreet, because it contains the majority of historic commercial structures set at or near the\nsidewalk, shall not exceed ten feet (10') setback from the right-of-way, except for outdoor\nPage 5 73\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ncaf\u00e9-type or other outdoor uses when a fence or wall is carried across the right-of-way to\ncontinue the visual continuity of building faces.\nb.\nc.\nPage 5 74\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nBUILDING BULK AND MASSING. Building bulk is categorized in width-to-height or height-\nto-width ratio and by a percentage of lot width coverage. All new buildings or additions\nto existing structures shall fall within a width-to-height or height-to width ratio between\n1:1.5 to 1:1. New nonresidential or mixed use construction located within the DO District\nshall utilize a design in which the building coverage of the lot facing the street at the street\nentrance level shall be at least seventy five percent (75%) of the total frontage of the lot at\nthe established setback. Where no vehicular use area separates the structure from the street,\nportions of the building up to 20 feet behind the established setback may also make up the\n75% lot frontage coverage. Required landscape areas, and up to twenty-five feet (25') of\ndriveway width, may be excluded from the lot frontage calculation. Where several new\nbuildings are proposed to be developed adjacent to each other along the same side of a\nstreet front, the percentage for drive openings may be combined and averaged within that\nblock face, in order to allow one (1) or two (2) driveways or loading areas for all the\nadjacent buildings.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nBUILDING DESIGN. Street walls and entrances must be designed to encourage and\ncomplement pedestrian-scale activity. Building design should not be conceived in\nisolation, as a singular entity, but should consider the structures at either side and in the\nneighborhood in general. It is intended that this be accomplished principally by the use of\narchitectural criteria such as building materials, roof styles, attachments to buildings, and\nwindows and doors arranged SO that the uses are visible from and/or accessible to the street\non at least fifty percent (50%) of the length of the ground level street frontage.\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \ni.\nWINDOWS. Where windows are used, multi-paned shop front windows are\npreferred and no single glass pane shall be greater than twelve (12) square feet.\nWindows of up to 20 square feet shall be allowed when mullions or other\ndecorative features are incorporated. Windows shall have clear or lightly tinted\nnon-reflective glass with a visible light transmission percentage 60% or higher, as\nverified by manufacturer or installer. Double hung windows with a height-to-\nwidth proportion of 2:1 are preferred for upper stories. Casements for windows\nshall be of wood, vinyl, or painted metal and may have stone, brick, or cast\nconcrete lintels and sills. Window glass shall always be set back from the building\nface rather than flush. Shop front windows shall not be lower than two feet (2')\nfrom the ground plane at front wall. Windows on the front of a building facing a\nstreet shall be at least fifteen (15) square feet and up to forty percent (40%) of the\ntotal street front first floor facade in Precinct 1 (described in the Downtown\nMaster Plan) and up to sixty percent (60%) of the total street front first floor\nfacade in Precinct 2 (described in the Downtown Master Plan).\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nii.\nBLANK WALLS. Expanses of solid wall facing a pedestrian use area, which may\ninclude a street, plaza, park, or parking lot, are not permitted to exceed ten (10)\nlinear feet. A blank exterior wall, when necessary, shall be broken or interrupted\nby one or more of the following:\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nA public doorway made of transparent materials;\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nA doorway made of opaque materials and recessed at least three feet (3') and\nnot more than five feet (5');\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nA public stairway directly available at street/plaza/park/parking lot level, but\nnot fire escapes or false stairways;\nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \nA window of at least fifteen (15) square feet in area and no more than four\nfeet (4') above the ground surface.\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \niii.\nBUILDING MATERIALS. Building materials should repeat and/or complement the\ntypes found in existing downtown buildings. Brick or wood shall be the\npredominant building materials of any wall facing a public street or pedestrian use\narea. Predominant shall mean no less than seventy five percent (75%) of the non-\nglassed wall surface facing the street or pedestrian use area. Materials used for\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nawnings and canopies are exempt from this provision and shall not be included in\nthe calculation. Other acceptable materials include stone, concrete-based stucco,\nconcrete, horizontal wood siding or wood shingle. Brick may be painted or\nunpainted. Trim shall be stone, cast stone, cast concrete, or painted wood.\niv.\nROOF STYLES. Roof styles shall reflect those generally found in the downtown\nand fringe areas. Due to the concentration of flat-roofed commercial buildings on\nthe 100 block of North Trade Street, any new development there shall use a flat\nroof. Elsewhere in the DO District flat roofs may be used if appropriate to the\noverall building style and to neighboring structures. Other acceptable roof styles\ninclude hipped, gables, or cross gabled. Roof pitch shall be between 5:12 and\n10:12. Single pitch shed roofs are not allowed except as a minor attachment to the\nrear of a structure, with minor defined as less than ten percent (10%) of the\nbuilding footprint. Mansard-style roofs or mansard attachments to a building wall\nare not permitted.\nV.\nDOORWAYS. Recessed doorways at street fronts are required and at non-street\npedestrian use areas are encouraged. This provides a sense of entry and adds\nsubtle variety to the streetscape. All structures shall have a street front entryway\nof at least one (1) square foot for each five hundred (500) square feet of floor area\nwith a ten (10) square foot minimum. When a structure will provide off-street\nparking to the side or rear in a separate or combined lot, then the same doorway\nsize requirements apply to the side or rear of the building. The maximum distance\nof recess from the exterior wall plan is five feet (5'). Doors shall be of wood,\npainted metal, or simulated wood material, or a combination of one of the above\nmaterials and glass. No glass shall be positioned lower than two feet (2') above\nground level at door entrance unless the door is of a traditional style with multiple\nglass panes.\nvi.\nCOLORS. Colors of buildings shall follow the Design Guidelines, including the\nnumber of main and trim colors and the combinations of light and dark shades.\nColors of adjacent structures shall be considered in choosing color schemes for\ncompatibility.\nvii.\nEXTERIOR SURFACES. Reflectivity of exterior surfaces, except for painted wood\nsiding, shall not exceed a reflectivity value of thirty six percent (36%), as\nmeasured under the applicable provisions of Federal Specifications DD-G-451d\n1977.\nviii.\nPROTECTED BUILDING ENTRANCES. The entrances to buildings and shop front\nwindows are permitted to have canopies and awnings made of canvas or treated\ncanvas material. Vinyl or metal awnings are not permitted. Flat, suspended, metal\ncanopies may be used on newly constructed buildings if consistent with the\narchitectural style of the building.

The Compliance Plan shall be submitted together with the proposed development Site Plan to the\nPlanning & Development Department and is subject to review by the Planning & Development Director. (Ord\n2434, Passed 9-9-19)\n155.505.\nTables of Allowed Uses\nUse of a building, structure or land shall be allowed only in the zoning districts indicated and for the purposes specified\nin the following Tables of Allowed Uses. Each use is mutually exclusive and does not encompass other uses listed in\nthe Tables. If a use is listed for one or more districts as an allowed use, then it is only allowed in that or those districts,\nand shall not be allowed within any district which does not indicate it is allowed.\nWhile most land uses will be assumed to be eligible to be located within one or more zoning districts within the Town\nlimits, some land uses may not be listed on these tables. Occasionally a new land use category may become viable,\nor a new combination of activities prompts a new land use type designation, and amendments may be made to this\nTitle to incorporate new land use categories as the need arises. When a specific use category is not clearly and directly\nrelated to a listed use category, and therefore cannot be determined to be considered essentially the same as a listed\nuse, then it is not allowed in the Town without amendment to this Chapter. The Zoning Administrator will interpret\nwhether a land use category fits within a listed category. Criteria for interpretations on land uses are given at\n155.203.C.\nSome land use activities have been determined by the Town to not be appropriate for overall community public health\nand safety, or may create adverse environmental impacts to surrounding properties, such as hazardous waste\nincinerators. Some unlisted uses have been determined to be injurious or not beneficial to the Town's economic\nviability, such as billboards that detract from the visual aesthetics of the community. Some uses may be of a density\nor intensity of development, create a level of noise, lights, odors, or vibrations, or generate inappropriate amounts of\ntraffic that would not be consistent with the land use policies, long range visions, and community values for the Town.\nA principal use listed in the Tables in any district denoted by the letter \"P\" is permitted by right provided all other\nrequirements of state law, this Title, and all other applicable ordinances and regulations of the Town of Matthews\nhave been satisfied. A principal use listed in the Tables of Allowed Uses in any district denoted by the letters PC\"\nis an allowed use with prescribed conditions and is only allowed subject to the provisions of \u00a7 155.506. An accessory\nuse listed in the Tables of Allowed Uses in any district denoted by the letters \"Acc\" is allowed only when a permitted\nprincipal use exists on the same property, and shall not be allowed without the accompanying permitted use. A use\nof building, structure or land not indicated by either \"P\", \"PC\", or \"Acc\" is not allowed in that district.

The cottage cluster housing development concept is intended to fill a niche in\nthe Matthews residential market and for that reason this style is intended to fit within established single-\nfamily zoning district classifications as an alternative use of land through infill or redevelopment. It is also\nintended to allow flexible new design of neighborhoods in other residential districts. As small dwelling units,\nthe\ncottages are anticipated to appeal to one (1) and two (2) person adult households which reduce the\npotential intensity of use within the general surrounding residential area. These developments are designed\nto provide residents with privacy and personal space of a detached house, significantly reduced outdoor\nmaintenance responsibilities, and the opportunity for community interaction within a contained set of closely\nspaced dwelling units. Each cottage cluster housing development must have its own architectural theme or\nset of unifying design elements which shall govern individual house units and common buildings, accessory\nstructures and common spaces. Individual cottages may be located on separate platted lots, or on undivided,\ncommonly-owned land. Common land may be designed in one (1) or more parcels per overall development\nsite, and different locations may have different amenities. Owners and residents within the development\nshare the use and maintenance responsibilities of common land, including parking, driveways, storage areas,\nmail and utility installations, and other improvements.

When a parcel of land to be developed as a cottage cluster\nhousing development includes an existing structure, it may remain and be incorporated into\nthe overall layout, when the extent of any nonconformity is not increased. Any existing\ndwelling unit intended to remain as a single-family dwelling shall be included in the\nmaximum permitted density and shall be located within a group of dwellings. An existing\ndwelling may be converted to a common building and be located adjacent to a cluster of\ndwellings or separate from other structures. Any existing accessory building or structure,\nsuch as a garage, storage shed, or swimming pool, may remain when located outside of any\nrequired setbacks and yards and meets the overall development's design theme.\nc.\nROOF LINES AND BUILDING HEIGHT. Because building separation is less than in a typical\nsingle-family subdivision configuration, the design of the overall development must create\nan adequate opportunity for each unit to receive sunlight and have a sense of privacy. The\npitch of roof lines, skylights, roof decks, and a variety of one (1), one and one-half 1/2),\nand two (2) story house plans within each group of dwellings are methods that may be used\nto accomplish this. No more than three (3) houses may be located immediately adjacent to\neach other with the same building height. Minimum roof pitch shall generally be no less\nthan 4:1, and flat or shed roofs shall generally be used only over covered porches or patios\nor outside access storage closets.\nd.\nEXTERIOR BUILDING MATERIALS. Exterior walls of dwelling units and common buildings\nshall utilize complementary materials. No more than three (3) materials (excluding\nwindows, doors, and trim) shall be used per individual building and they shall generally be\ncarried around all sides of the structure. Preferred materials include masonry, horizontal\nwood siding, cementicious siding, blocks or panels, and stucco/simulated stucco. Roof\nleaves are encouraged to create a sense of dimension and to provide shade from summer\nsun. Gutters or other methods of diverting rain water to the ground away from door\nentranceways shall be incorporated into the dwelling architectural elements.\ne.\nFACADES FACING INTERIOR COMMON SPACE. Each dwelling unit shall have a covered\nraised porch or at-grade patio, generally oriented toward the common space for the separate\ncluster of homes. Where a door entry to a dwelling faces a common space and is not\naccessed via the porch or patio, then that doorway shall have its own overhang or weather\nprotection a minimum of five feet (5') wide in length and width. An open air deck or patio\nmay also be included adjacent to a dwelling facing any common land area, whether in the\nprivate use portion of the fenced area between house and common space, or at a side or\nrear door access to a dwelling adjacent to common area used for parking, public services\nand utilities, or other community purposes.

A communications antenna is considered a principal use or a\nsecondary principal use on any site, except when it is either incidental to a business use on the same lot and\nused by that business for its operational communications. They are permitted as a secondary principal use in\nresidential districts (R-20, R-15, R-12, R-9, R-MH, R-VS, and CrC) where a permitted nonresidential\nprincipal use exists.\nB.\nSITING HIERARCHY PREFERENCES\nThe following list indicates the Town's preferences for communications facility locations, in descending\norder of preference:\nAntenna mounted on/in an existing stealth (concealed) structure or building\nAntenna mounted on/in an existing building/structure\nAntenna mounted on an existing utility or light pole\nCollocation on existing communications tower\nNew freestanding stealth structure\nSlick stick\nNew non-stealth monopole\nThese preferences are intended as guidance for development of an application for communication facilities.\nC.\nSTANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATION TOWERS.\n1.\nRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. Antennas may be located in stealth applications on supporting structures\nwhich are or will be the principal use or a permitted accessory structure to the principal use of the\nsite in any residential district, and shall not be more than eighty feet (80') in overall height (antenna\nand supporting structure). Where structures which existed as of June 9, 1997 exceed eighty feet\n(80') in height, such as electric transmission towers, these structures may also be used for antenna\nlocations. When an existing stealth structure is used, communications antennas may not increase\nthe stealth structure's height by more than twenty feet (20') per antenna, up to forty feet (40')\nadditional in height, and only when such location shall not require the antenna to be lighted.\n2.\nMULTI-FAMILY DISTRICTS. Antennas may be located on buildings or in stealth applications on\nsupporting structures in the R-15MF, R-12MF, SRN, and C-MF districts, and shall not be more than\neighty feet (80') in overall height (antenna and supporting structure). Where structures which\nexisted as of June 9, 1997 exceed eighty feet (80') in height, such as electric transmission towers,\nthese structures may also be used for antenna locations. Because these districts typically have multi-\nstory construction, location of antennas on building walls and rooftops is the preferred application.\nMaximum heights are given in the table below.\n3.\nMIXED USE AND NONRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS. Antennas may be located on towers or other\nsupporting structures in the R/I district (except as given in table below), and all mixed use or\nnonresidential districts except the HUC and AU districts up to the overall heights listed below.\n4.\nDOWNTOWN OVERLAY DISTRICT.

There are many advantages in the implementation of these types of wireless\ncommunications systems. These systems can be adopted and used in residential, suburban, and urban areas\nwhere sufficient wireless coverage is lacking. These are relatively small structures that can be easily\nconcealed or placed SO that they are not visually obvious or prominent. DAS and Small Cell Sites may be\nplaced within any zoning districts. Certain criteria apply when placing DAS and Small Cell Sites within\nspecific districts.\nThese standards apply to applications on private property and Town maintained right-of-way.\n1.\nLOCATIONS OF WIRELESS FACILITIES.\na.\nAdhering to the siting hierarchy in $155.506.41.B, wireless facilities are encouraged to\ncollocate on existing utility and street light poles whenever possible in order to reduce the\nproliferation of poles in right-of-way.\nb.\nNo new utility pole may be installed for the principal use of wireless facilities if a pole\nPage 5 123\n"}, {"page": "245", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nexists within twenty feet (20') of a desired location. If a pole exists within twenty feet (20')\nof the proposed location but cannot meet the height or load bearing demands for the\nwireless facility installation, that existing pole can be replaced with an appropriate new\npole, not increasing in height more than ten feet (10')\nC.\nAlong town maintained street rights-of-way where there are no existing utility poles (all\nunderground utilities), wireless facilities may be attached to street lights in the public right-\nof-way. An encroachment agreement (permit) must be issued by the Public Works Director\nbefore installation. Approval from the owner of the light pole must be submitted with the\neasement agreement. Equipment cabinet(s) for systems placed on light poles in the rear\nof private property in utility easements shall be located underground, at the base or on the\ncorresponding light pole.\n2.\nWIRELESS FACILITIES STANDARDS\na.\nWhen antennas are placed on top of a building in the Downtown Overlay, wireless facilities\nmust be located within an equipment penthouse, or on top of a building behind the parapet\nSO as not to be seen from the public realm, occupied window, or occupied rooftop when\ninstalled. Wireless facilities will be limited to three feet (3') in height above the parapet\nand must be seventy-five (75) to one hundred (100) percent concealed. Wireless facilities\ncannot be visible from the public realm and must blend in with the look and design of\nwhere they are being located.\nb.\nEquipment cabinet(s) shall be located at the rear or non-street side of a building not visible\nto pedestrians. Equipment cabinet(s) for systems placed on utility poles or street lights shall\nbe located underground. Equipment cabinets can be placed on the utility pole ten feet (10')\nabove ground level or at the base of the corresponding utility pole or street light only when\nthe applicant can show proof that underground placement is not feasible. All supporting\nequipment (meters, switches, ground equipment and the like) must be no more than 28\ncubic feet, ten feet (10') from back edge of sidewalk and no more than five feet (5') in\nheight. Sealed drawings shall be provided indicating that the utility pole or street light can\nphysically accommodate the equipment.\nc.\nWithin the Highway Overlay district, wireless facilities can be placed on existing buildings\nor structures including utility poles. New poles for the sole purpose of wireless facilities\nshall only be placed in the existing driveway locations. Where tree clearing has occurred,\nit must remain open. They may not be placed in HO buffer except for existing cleared area\nof driveway or interior to the site. If wireless facilities are placed on top of an existing\nbuilding, they shall be placed within an equipment penthouse, or behind the parapet. Roof\ntop applications shall be limited to no more than three feet (3') in height above the parapet,\nconcealed from the public realm, and must blend in with the look and design of where they\nare being located.\nd.\nOutside of overlay districts, wireless facilities may be placed on existing utility poles\nlocated within the public right-of-way, on buildings or on other structures which can be\nshown to meet structural integrity. An encroachment agreement (permit) must be issued by\nthe Public Works Director before installation. If wireless facilities are placed on top of an\nexisting building, they shall be placed within an equipment penthouse, or behind the\nparapet. Roof top applications shall be limited to no more than three feet (3') in height\nabove the parapet, concealed from the public realm, and must blend in with the look and\ndesign of where they are being located.\n3.\nCOLLOCATION\nThe Town encourages the installation of wireless facilities on existing structures to avoid\nunnecessary duplication of supporting structures (poles, towers, etc). Collocated facilities and\nequipment may be separately owned and used by more than one entity.\na.\nAll new wireless facilities that require the use of support structure shall be designed and\nconstructed to provide opportunity for collocation and utilize neutral host equipment\ncapable of use by multiple additional wireless communication providers.\nb.\nAs a condition of installing a new pole or facility for wireless communication services,\nthe owner of a new pole shall reasonably consent to allowing future requests for\nPage 5 124\n"}, {"page": "246", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\ncollocation by other providers of personal wireless services on reasonable terms and\nconditions that do not discriminate between similarly situated providers of wireless\ncommunication services.\nc.\nNew wireless facilities that cannot be collocated on an existing wireless facility or utility\npole must be separated by a minimum of 400 linear feet from any existing wireless facility.\nE.\nINSTALLATIONS OF NEW POLES IN SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\n1.\nThe minimum distance of a new pole from any residential structure shall be at least 150% of the\npole height and shall not be located directly in front of any residential structure located in a single\nfamily zoning district.

A\nseries of such collectors are often placed in close proximity to each other for cumulative energy production\nand transmission. Such installations may be located as an accessory use, such as in a residential environment\nto power household utilities or to provide heat for potable water or enclosed spaces on individual properties,\nor may be concentrated on a site as a principal use primarily to generate power which is transmitted off-site.\nAccessory solar collector installations for individual dwellings or personal and direct use by the occupant\nof\nthe structure are allowed in any district. Larger installations for energy generation may be allowed in most\nnonresidential and mixed use districts as provided below. Design of a solar collector installation shall take\ninto account the existing restriction and/or potential future loss of solar access as a result of any trees,\nlandscaping, buildings, other structures, and topography in existence at the time the solar collector installation\nreceived permits from Mecklenburg LUESA to be installed.

The following general\nprinciples are encouraged to be applied throughout the Town in all zoning districts, and must be followed when\nConditional-Only zoning designation is requested for the SRN, C-MF, MUD, TS, and ENT districts:\nBuildings form the public realm that is primarily streets and pedestrian pathways.\nThe street is a coherent space, with consistent building form. This agreement of buildings\nfacing across the public realm contributes to a clear public space and identity.\nBuildings oversee the street with active fronts. This overview of the public realm\ncontributes to vital and safe public space.\nLand should be clearly public or private-in public view and under surveillance or private\nand protected.\nBuildings are designed for communal encounters, and must be designed for the urban\nsituation within the Town. Views are directed to the public space as much as possible.\nVehicle storage/parking, (not including on-street parking), garbage storage and collection,\nand mechanical equipment are kept away from the public realm.\n155.602.2\nCivic Use Areas.\nWithin the various Conditional-Only district there may be appropriate locations for improvements and structures\navailable to the general public. Their design can significantly enhance the ambiance of the public realm.\nA.\nCIVIC BUILDINGS. Civic buildings contain public or civic uses of special significance to residents, employees,\nor visitors. Civic buildings are used for the following purposes: community services, day care, education,\ngovernment, places of worship, or social services. Civic buildings must be designed to physically express\ntheir community prominence, which means they should generally be sited adjoining or surrounded by civic\nspaces or where they provide a visual landmark by being placed at the axial termination of a street.\nB.\nCIVIC OUTDOOR SPACES. Civic greens, squares and plazas shall be designed, planted and maintained\naccording to the following requirements. Squares and plazas are generally intended to be active pedestrian\ncenters and should be designed appropriate to their high foot traffic level with a higher percentage of paved\nsurface area and should provide scattered short-interval seating accommodations. Civic greens are spaces\nintended for less intensive foot traffic and visitors may stay for a longer duration. Use of pervious paving\nmaterials is encouraged to allow oxygen to reach tree roots.\n1.\nTrees planted within civic spaces provide a landscape and civic architecture that complement the\nsurrounding building architecture. A clear view through the public space between two (2') to eight\nfeet (8') in height is important for safety and urban design purposes. The foliage of newly planted\ntrees may intrude below the eight foot (8') clear vision level for up to four (4) growing seasons, and\nlow hanging branches of large maturing preserved trees may encroach into the eight foot (8') clear\nvision space when not extending over a paved walkway.\n2.\nMaterials and Configurations.\na.\nStreet trees shall be planted along the perimeter of the square or civic green at an average\nspacing not greater than forty feet (40') on center.

The principles also specify certain details, such as window\nproportions, roof or parapet configurations, shop fronts, and overhang features. The intent behind these urban design\nprinciples is to foster a unique image while utilizing regionally appropriate elements. While materials, techniques,\nand product types are identified in this Title as allowed, use of equivalent or better practices and products are\nencouraged. They shall be submitted to the Town Planning office either for Administrative Amendment as explained\nat \u00a7 155.401.5 or Flexible Design as explained at \u00a7 155.401.7., whichever applies. Many of the principles apply only\nin conditions where the building elements are clearly visible from the public use realm, including streets, shared\nparking areas, and civic spaces. These urban design principles therefore concentrate on the views from the public\nrealm and minimize interference in the private realm. For example, an architectural element that is visible only through\nan opening in the street wall is not clearly visible from the public realm. The following general principles are\nencouraged throughout the Town in all zoning districts and must be followed when Conditional-Only zoning\ndesignation is requested for the SRN, C-MF, MUD, TS, and ENT districts.\n155.603.2\nExterior Building Walls\nExterior building walls shall generally reflect and complement the traditional materials and construction techniques\nof the Charlotte region on all sides of any structure which may be visible from the public realm. They should express\nthe construction techniques and structural constraints of traditional, long-lasting, building materials. Simple\nconfigurations and solid craftsmanship are favored over complexity and ostentation in building form and the\narticulation of details. All building materials to be used shall express their specific properties. For example, heavier\nmore permanent materials (masonry) support lighter materials (wood).\nBuildings constructed for commercial uses, particularly retail, which are predominately or wholly single story\nfacilities, need to pay particular attention to the impact of their bulk and length along public street frontages. In order\nto improve the appearance from the public realm, these buildings should break up any expanses of blank walls with\nthe use of exterior materials changes, a shift in wall location SO that the frontage is not on a single plane parallel to the\nstreet, window and door openings, architectural design elements, and similar visually obvious detail changes that break\nup the horizontal expanse of plain wall. To the greatest extent possible, single story buildings greater than thirty\nthousand square feet (30,000 sq ft) and/or with a front elevation longer than one hundred feet (100') facing the public\nrealm should utilize some architectural and visual variety to reduce the appearance of a single monolithic structure\nwhen initially designed or renovated for retail use. (Am. Ord 2264 passed 10-9-17)\n155.603.3\nRoofs and Parapets\nRoofs and parapets should demonstrate a commonsense recognition of the climate by utilizing appropriate pitch,\ndrainage, and materials in order to provide visual coherence.\n155.603.4\nWindows and Doors\nThe placement, type, and size of windows and doors help to establish the scale and vitality of the public realm. For\nnonresidential and mixed use buildings, they allow interplay between the business interiors and the street or public\nrealm space. For residential buildings, they foster \"eyes on the street\" surveillance which provides for security and\nsafety in the area. Windows should be divided by multiple panes of glass. This helps the window \"hold\" the surface\nof the fa\u00e7ade, rather than appearing like a \"hole\" in the wall, an effect produced by a large single sheet of glass.\nPage 601\nCELL (1, 1): \n155.603.\nCELL (1, 2): \nBuildings - General Urban Design Principles\nCELL (2, 1): \n155.603.1\nCELL (2, 2): \nGeneral\n"}, {"page": "267", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nWhen larger single-story buildings are initially designed for commercial retail uses, they should include windows\nalong at least forty percent (40%) of the length of the fa\u00e7ade facing the public realm and should provide placement\nfor future door openings for eventual reuse by multiple users. \"Larger buildings\" refers to single story buildings\ngreater than thirty thousand square feet (30,000 sq ft) and/or with a front elevation longer than one hundred feet\n(100') facing the public realm. (Am.

Signs should be scaled to the nature of the\nparticular area of the designated district, such as a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented first floor environment, a high\nvolume and free-flowing traffic corridor, or predominately residential. Inappropriate use or placement of signage\nincreases driver distraction, intrudes into and lessens the urban environment pedestrian experience, and creates visual\nclutter.\n(Ord# passed 12-9-13; Am.

The amount of tree canopy covering a site is an indication of the site's ability to retard\nstorm water run-off, mitigate air pollution, and contribute to site-cooling effects. The tree canopy\nrequirements outlined here may also be applied to the minimum Undisturbed Open Space\nrequirements of Chapter 8, the Post Construction Ordinance.\n2.\nREQUIREMENTS. A minimum percentage of tree canopy is required to be maintained or created on\nany development site or on any site of any land disturbing activity. If a site over one (1) acre in\nsize was formerly in a forested state and fifty percent (50%) or more of the land area was clear cut\nwithin three (3) years of the plan submittal date for any land disturbing activity, then the tree\ncanopy preservation requirements must be applied as though the site was not clear cut. It will be\nthe applicant's responsibility to provide proof that any clear cutting activity on the site took place\ngreater than three years prior to the current submittal date.\na.\nThe amount of existing canopy that must be preserved on the site during development is\ndetermined by two (2) factors: the zoning district classification; and the percentage of\nexisting tree canopy present before any land disturbing activity, as indicated below:\nTABLE OF MINIMUM TREE CANOPY REQUIREMENTS\nb.\nWhenever the existing tree canopy is greater than twenty percent (20%) of the total\nproperty area, then a minimum canopy must be preserved, as defined in the above table at\n\u00a7 155.606.7.A.2.a.\nPage 606 8\nCELL (1, 1): \nZoning District\nCELL (1, 2): \nRequired Tree Canopy\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-15, R-20\nCELL (2, 2): \n20%\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-9, R-12, R-MH, R-15MF,\nR-12MF, CrC, R/I, O, B-1, B-3,\nBD, AU\nCELL (3, 2): \n15%\nCELL (4, 1): \nB-1SCD, B-H,\nCELL (4, 2): \n12%\nCELL (5, 1): \nI-1, I-2, MUD, ENT, SRN\nCELL (5, 2): \n10%\nCELL (6, 1): \nR-VS, MUD, SRN, ENT\nCELL (6, 2): \n8%\nCELL (7, 1): \nHUC, C-MF, TS\nCELL (7, 2): \n5%\n"}, {"page": "306", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nC.\nWhenever the existing tree canopy of the site prior to land disturbance is less than twenty\npercent (20%) of the total property area, then the percentage of canopy, as defined in \u00a7\n155.606.7.A.2.a, must be achieved by a combination of preservation and new planting.\nProperty within the ENT district may request minimum tree canopy preservation\nreduction through the use of Flexible Design Standards at $155.401.7.

In order to qualify for payment-in-lieu, the\nApplicant shall submit a letter outlining the unique hardship(s) that make the tree canopy\nrequirement difficult to meet. Examples of unique hardships may include: conditions that\nare peculiar to the property; topography which does not allow ADA compliance or stub\nstreet connections; scattered location of large trees on the site; limited options for utility\nplacement; and inability to achieve an appropriate development density. Personal\nhardships not directly related to the land do not justify use of this section. The Applicant\nmust explain how the deviation from the tree canopy requirements are consistent with the\nspirit, purpose, and intent of the Town's policies to preserve existing trees during\ndevelopment.

When this category is offered, an explanation of the\nspecific criteria to justify a parking reduction shall be included.\nf.\nA signed commitment indicating agreement to an Alternative Parking Plan from all property\nowners within the site. This may be in the form of a recorded cross access parking agreement\ncreated for the multi-user site when initially developed, or may be a new agreement between all\naffected property owners.\ni.\nA previously recorded agreement shall state which parking spaces within the site,\nincluding across internal property lines when a multi-lot development site, are not\nrestricted to a single user and may be available for shared parking. A copy of the\nrecorded agreement shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator and shall be retained\nin the Planning office files of zoning conditions for the site.\nii.\nA new shared parking agreement shall guarantee the identified parking spaces to be\nmaintained and available for shared use as long as the business uses requiring them are in\nexistence. The agreement shall be binding on all property owners and businesses and\nPage 607 21\n"}, {"page": "342", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nestablishments within the overall site, and shall be recorded by the property owner(s) in\nthe Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds, and a copy filed with the Zoning\nAdministrator, which shall be retained in the Planning office files of zoning conditions\nfor the site.

Such uses may request approval, through the site plan\nreview and approval process outlined in \u00a7 155.401.5.B, for occasional overflow parking. Typical\nusers may include sporting or recreation facilities that do not regularly, but occasionally, hold\nlarge events, or retail establishments that meet the required minimum space requirements for their\ntype use and zoning district, but wish to have extra parking available for once or twice a year\nmajor sales events. Uses with regularly scheduled events or activities on a weekly or monthly\nbasis shall not be eligible for this occasional overflow parking provision.\nb.\nBecause the extra demand for parking may occur when weather or recent maintenance work had\nsoftened the ground surface, any overflow parking area shall be designed with an adequate\nsubsurface to support vehicles and limit damage to the ground surface. Occasional overflow\nparking shall be designated on the facility's site plan and the subsurface design shall be approved\nby Mecklenburg LUESA and the Town Engineer. No occasional overflow parking or maneuvering\narea shall be located within tree root protection zones designated on the approved landscape plan\nfor the property, and the overflow parking plan shall indicate how tree root protection zones shall\nbe protected from vehicular activity.\nc.\nUses which desire to reduce a portion of their required parking spaces due to the limited times\nthey need their full required amount, such as a stadium which only is fully occupied on a less\nthan once a month basis, may request a permanent parking reduction by designing additional\nopen space which can also serve as occasional overflow parking. In these cases, the use shall\nconduct a parking needs study that shall determine the typical peak parking load for various\nevents, showing actual counts (if available) for recent past events, or estimated demand figures\nbased on similar facilities and events. The study shall provide counts of the maximum actual or\nanticipated attendance and maximum actual or anticipated parking space need for various events\nand activities at the facility, and indicate the frequency (actual or anticipated) of each type activity.\nThe study shall show conclusions as to the amount of permanent paved parking the facility\nshould have, and the amount of occasional overflow parking spaces that can be accommodated to\nprovide the facility's required parking, per the table at $155.607.7.B.

The lower\nhorizontal surface of the canopy shall not exceed fourteen feet (14') above the bottom of the ground\nlevel door opening. A canopy top sign shall not exceed twelve feet (12') in width, or seventy-five\nper cent (75%) of the width of the canopy whichever is less.

Certain portable signs, up to eight (8) square feet in sign area and not more than five feet\n(5') in total height, may be allowed in the Downtown Overlay. Due to the specific character of subsections of\nthe Downtown (historic core, arts-focused, contemporary, etc.), the use of differing shapes and materials for\nportable signs is allowed, and signs that match or complement the architectural theme, age, materials, and\ncolors of the associated building are strongly encouraged. Acceptable forms may include but are not limited\nto: a two-sided A-frame configuration; an upright single or two-sided structure with a weighted foot or pedestal;\na two- or three-dimensional shape or statue that provides hanging or fixed support for a flat message surface\nmessage area; or a chalkboard or board of other material with a weighted foot or pedestal. The use of molded\nplastic A-frame signs is not consistent with the character of downtown and is strongly discouraged. Because a\nportable sign's primary intent is to offer regularly updated details related to the business enterprise, like daily\nmeal specials, the information included on an A-frame sign must be more than identification of the\nestablishment. Such signs are intended to provide information to pedestrians, who may stop to take in the full\nmessage, SO these signs need to be located near the pedestrian entrance, and must not prohibit pedestrian flow\nor safety around them. They may be displayed in front, and within twenty feet (20'), of the associated use's\nfront door or front gate entrance. Where the associated use has a side or rear public entrance as well, then a\nsecond portable sign of the same type, size, and location relative to side/rear door may be permitted. When\nthere is sufficient space between the wall of the building or use and the street right-of-way, then such portable\nsign must be located behind the right-of-way line. When the building is located at the street right-of-way, the\nportable sign may be located within the street right-of- way, provided the sign does not prohibit pedestrian\nflow, block drivers' visibility, and has approval from the Town or NCDOT, as appropriate. [formerly \u00a7\n153.064.I]\nI.\nMURALS. Murals may or may not be classified as signs based on whether they incorporate any advertising\nmessage for contemporary establishments and/or contemporary merchandise/services. Even though not\ntechnically signs, they are highly visible in the public realm. The Town Board of Commissioners has\ndetermined it is advantageous to the community to establish the following design requirements for non-\nsign mural placement within the downtown area. [formerly \u00a7 153.064(O)]\n1.\nPURPOSE. To increase community identity and foster a unique sense of place in downtown\nMatthews, murals are encouraged on buildings located within the Downtown Overlay District.\nFor the purpose of these requirements, murals are purely artistic forms of expression that do not\nincorporate any advertisement for products, services or businesses. These forms of expression are\ngenerally regulated on a content-neutral basis and no mural will be permitted that contains\nlanguage or design elements deemed offensive to the community.\n2.\nREQUIREMENTS. No person shall paint a wall mural on the exterior of any structure or change any\nexisting mural on the exterior of any structure prior to the issuance of a wall mural permit. The\nfollowing design criteria shall apply to any mural artwork commissioned in the Downtown\nOverlay.\na.\nThe proposed wall mural shall be well integrated with the building and neighboring\nstructures and be harmonious with the surrounding environment. The proposed wall\nmural, by its design, scale, construction and location, shall not have a substantial adverse\neffect on abutting property or the permitted use, and will contribute to Matthews unique\ncharacter and quality of life.\nb.\nThe proposed wall mural shall exhibit exceptional design quality that enhances the\noverall development and appearance of both the site and Downtown Matthews. The paint\nand/or materials to be used and applied on the structure shall be appropriate for use in an\noutdoor locale for an artistic rendition and shall be of a permanent or long lasting variety.\n3.\nMAINTENANCE. Maintenance of the wall mural is the responsibility of the property owner. It shall be\nthe property owner's responsibility to remove the wall mural if it is not maintained as required.\nGraffiti shall be removed in accordance with the Graffiti Abatement Ordinance requirements for\ngraffiti removal in Chapter 94A. While natural aging is acceptable, murals that are not maintained\nsufficiently may be considered a public nuisance.\n4.\nANTI-GRAFFITI COATING REQUIRED. An anti-graffiti coating shall be applied to all murals at the\ntime of installation and reapplied at intervals determined by the manufacturer.\n5.\nPERMIT REQUIRED. A mural permit application shall be completed by the applicant and submitted to\nthe Town Planning office to be referred to the appropriate committee for review and approval. The\napplication shall include at a minimum the intended location of the mural, size, subject matter, medium\nPage 608 17\n"}, {"page": "362", "text": "TOWN OF MATTHEWS UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nand a summary of the general color palette to be used.

Ord. 2279, passed 2-12-18)\n155.608.15 Special Sign Corridors Created.\nA.\nCertain geographic corridors exhibit, or have the potential of exhibiting, unique signage needs due to the\nhigher speed and high volume traffic generated by major highways. Special sign corridors may be established\nwith differing regulations from the rest of the jurisdiction in order to establish, enhance, and preserve the\nproperty values and economic viability of such corridors. Such special sign corridors shall meet the\nfollowing:\n1.\nThe area shall follow on each side of a major highway carrying average daily traffic in excess of\nthirty thousand (30,000) vehicles.\n2.\nThe boundaries set for the special sign corridor shall include only those properties whose visibility is\ndirectly impacted by the major highway. These boundaries shall be established at the time the special\nsign corridor is adopted, and the criteria for inclusion into the special sign corridor shall be clearly\ndefined.\n3.\nThe Board of Commissioners shall determine, upon recommendation by Planning Board, that the\ncorridor exhibits, or has the potential to exhibit, unique signage needs related to the speed and\nvolume of traffic which makes it different from other commercial or industrial corridors in the\njurisdiction. In making such determination, these findings should be made:\n4.\nRegulations which may be modified shall take into consideration those factors causing the unique\nsignage needs, including but not limited to: horizontal distance of the affected property from the\nmajor highway right-of-way, natural and man-made topography and road grade changes, road\noverpasses and underpasses, limited access for drivers, the greater than normal length of road\nfrontage and/or building frontage along the major highway, the total building area covered by a\nsingle use or group of uses on a property, and the average speed of vehicles traveling on the major\nhighway.\nB.\nPROCEDURE FOR CREATING A SPECIAL SIGN CORRIDOR. The Planning Board, either on its own\ndetermination or by request from the Board of Commissioners, shall prepare documentation satisfying the\nreview criteria listed in division (A) of this section and report its findings to the Board of Commissioners.\nThe Board of Commissioners may set a public hearing date to discuss the findings and receive public input.\nProperty owners in and adjacent to the proposed district shall be notified of the pending action by first class\nmail. The special sign corridor shall become effective only after the Board of Commissioners makes\nadequate findings, as listed in division (A) of this section, following the public hearing.\nC.\nSPECIAL SIGN CORRIDORS LISTED.

Purpose and Intent\nIt is the purpose and intent of this Outdoor Illumination Section to accomplish the following:\nA.\nTo encourage the use of lighting design practices and systems that will: i) minimize glare, light trespass and\nlight pollution; ii) conserve energy and resources while maintaining nighttime safety, security and\nproductivity; and iii) curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment.\nB.\nTo establish clear and comprehensive outdoor lighting standards with an emphasis on reducing glare and\nlight trespass by requiring, in most circumstances, full cut-off (preferred) lighting fixtures.\nC.\nTo allow for outdoor lighting that is appropriate for the task and to establish light fixture height, lumen output,\ndistribution and illumination limits that will help prevent light trespass to adjacent properties.\nD.\nTo establish specific standards for certain land uses that typically have unique lighting requirements, such as\n(but not limited to) automotive dealerships, service stations, and outdoor sporting facilities.\n155.609.2. Applicability\nThis outdoor lighting standard applies to any development, expansion or improvement within non-residential districts\nand non-residential uses in residential districts, any multi-family housing or mixed development which incorporates\nresidential units, athletic fields, and the construction of parking lots where such developments include the installation\nof new outdoor lighting fixtures or the replacement of existing lighting fixtures. It shall also apply to all proposed\nresidential subdivisions and multi-family developments. All new construction projects shall have enough exterior\nlighting to meet the minimum safety and security requirements of the International Code Council (ICC), the National\nElectrical Code (NEC), Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA), and the North Carolina Building\nCode (NCBC) family of codes including the NC Energy Conservation Code. The replacement of an existing lighting\nfixture is defined as a change of the type of fixture; a change in the mounting height of a fixture on a pole, building,\nor other structure; or a change in the location of a lighting fixture. All of these applications require compliance with\nthis section.

Traffic studies have shown that highly connected street networks provide\nmuch greater traffic throughput and mobility for a community, at less cost. A high degree\nof connectivity should occur not only at the level of arterials, but also on collector, local\nand other secondary roads. Such connectivity vastly improves a street network's\nperformance. The street pattern should not force short trips of one (1) or two (2) miles\nonto Class I or II roads; it should be possible to make trips of this sort by using collector\nor other secondary streets. With a highly connected street network, cross-town trips should\nbe possible using fairly direct secondary roads.\nAll development in nonresidential and mixed use zoning districts shall be designed to allow\nfor cross-access to adjacent properties within these zoning districts to encourage shared\nparking and shared access points on public and private streets. When cross access is\ndeemed impractical by the Public Works Director on the basis of severe topography,\nenvironmental constraints or vehicular safety factors, and is not detailed by the CTP or any\nsmall area plan which includes a street network layout, the requirement may be waived\nprovided that appropriate bicycle and pedestrian connections are provided between\nadjacent developments or land uses. Development plans should provide a cross-access\neasement and complete the connection if completing the link can derive an immediate\nbenefit. If no immediate benefit can be derived, development plans should provide cross\naccess and construction easements and arrange the site design SO when the adjoining\nproperty owner extends the connection to the property line, the link will be completed, and\na financial guarantee equivalent to the cost of construction on a per lineal foot basis in\ncurrent dollar value shall be provided to the Town. If the link is to be completed in the\nfuture, the grade and angle of the connection, as well as the location of parking,\nlandscaping, and other improvements must be set at the time of development of the\npremises to allow for reasonable and feasible extension into the adjacent property.

At a minimum, a second point of open and functioning vehicular access\nfrom the existing public street system (not a stub-out or a temporary dead-end) is required\nfor developments that exceed one hundred (100) residential units, and a third shall be\nrequired for developments that exceed three hundred fifty (350) residential units. These\nsecond and third points shall be open and functioning prior to the issuance of the 101st and\n351st Certificate of Occupancy respectively for the development.

If a\nTraffic Impact Analysis should establish a higher standard for the number of open and\nfunctioning vehicular access points from the existing public street system, the requirement\nof the Traffic Impact Analysis shall prevail. These requirements shall not preclude a\ndevelopment from also meeting the connectivity index required in \u00a7 155.701.C.4.c.

Failure to secure a permit prior to construction may result in the removal of\nthe improvements at the expense of the property owner and/or developer, and may result\nin the denial of access at that location. All driveways must conform to design and\nconstruction standards established by the Town and NCDOT if applicable. All driveways\nwithin the Town shall be hard-surfaced in concrete or asphalt within the right-of-way and\nextending to 5-feet behind the sidewalk where sidewalk exists or is planned. For curbed\nroadways, concrete is required for the surface; for uncurbed roadways without sidewalk,\nasphalt is also acceptable. Driveway types are chosen from the MCLDSM. Nothing in this\nsection exempts any person from complying with any regulations or requirements of the\nstate regarding driveway connections to state maintained roads, nor does compliance with\nall state regulations exempt any person from the provisions of this section. In cases where\nthese regulations may overlap or conflict, the more restrictive provision shall control. The\ngranting of a driveway permit by the Town Public Works Department does not insure the\ngranting of a state permit; however Mecklenburg LUESA will evaluate all applications\nunder both sets of regulations and advise the applicant if a problem exists which may result\nin the rejection of the request.

Crossovers along median divided streets Class IV and higher\nshould be spaced no closer than one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'). For all other streets, the\nspacing should be no closer than six hundred sixty feet (660'). In general, if the left turn lane\nstorage\nrequirements for adjacent intersections overlap, the minimum spacing shall be increased to provide\nadequate left turn lane storage in both directions. Where the NCDOT Driveway Manual or Median\nCrossover Guide conflicts, the stricter of the two standards should prevail.\n10.\nTRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS. The Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is\na\nspecialized study that evaluates the effects of a development's traffic on the surrounding\ntransportation infrastructure. It is an essential part of the development review process to assist\ndevelopers and government agencies in making land use decisions involving subdivisions, rezoning,\nsite plan reviews, expansions of existing development, and other development reviews. The TIA\nhelps identify where the development may have a significant impact on safety, traffic and\ntransportation operations, and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to\nmitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be used to evaluate if the scale of development is\nappropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary, on and off the site, to\nprovide safe and efficient access, multimodal transportation amenities and traffic flow. The TIA\nalso can be a tool to evaluate the incremental impacts on the surrounding transportation\ninfrastructure and how to mitigate those impacts to maintain safe traffic and transportation\noperations.

The percentage of Open Space required depends on a project's built-\nupon area as described below. Undisturbed Open Space requirements can be met in stream or lake buffers,\ndesignated common areas or on individual lots for residential development (e.g., backyards, borders, etc.).\nUndisturbed Open Space cannot be designated within rights of way, utility easements, etc. where re-\ndisturbance could occur. Grass fields can also be used to meet Undisturbed Open Space requirements;\nhowever, the fields must be replanted in accordance with the tree planting provisions described in \u00a7\n155.805.E. below. Undisturbed Open Space is preferred where it will provide maximum water quality benefit\n(i.e., around gullies and existing drainage areas, adjacent to streams and wetlands, around structural BMPs,\netc.).
