It is the purpose of this Section to promote public health, safety, and general\nwelfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by\nprovisions designed to:\n1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion\nhazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n2)\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3)\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,\nwhich are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n4)\nControl filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood\ndamage; and\n5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or\nwhich may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n(D) Objectives.

The fact that property may be utilized for greater profit, however,\nwill not be considered adequate to justify the granting of a variance.\n3)\nThe Board shall not, under any circumstances, grant a variance to permit a use or density not\notherwise permitted by this Ordinance in the zoning district involved.\n4)\nNeither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district, nor\nthe permitted use of lands, buildings or structures in other zoning districts shall be considered\nas\ngrounds for the issuance of a variance. Furthermore, mere financial hardship does not constitute\ngrounds for the granting of a variance.\n5)\nA variance may be granted where a building permit has been issued and, due to unintentional\nerror of the Enforcement Officer in determining the location of the structure on the property, there\nis a minimal violation of the dimensional requirements, provided that such relief may be granted\nwithout substantially impairing the purpose and intent of this Ordinance.\n(C) Granting of variance. A variance may be granted by the Board if evidence presented by the applicant\npersuades it to reach the following conclusions:\n1)\nUnnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the Ordinance regulation. It shall\nnot be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be\nmade of the property.\n2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size or\ntopography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from\nconditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for\ngranting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a\nreasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\n3)\nThe hardship did not result from the actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act\nof purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a\nvariance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n4)\nThe requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the regulation, such\nthat public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\n(D) Conditions. In granting a variance, the Board may prescribe such reasonable and appropriate\nconditions and safeguards as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will\nbe compatible with surrounding properties and will not alter the essential character of the\nneighborhood.\n1)\nViolations of such conditions and safeguards, when a part of the terms under which the variance\nis granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance.\n2)\nA variance granted subject to a condition shall be permitted only so long as there is compliance\nwith the condition.\n3)\nIf a violation of a condition of a variance occurs, the Enforcement Officer may revoke the certificate\nof occupancy in accordance with the same procedures used to grant the variance.\n4)\nIn the event that any such condition is held invalid, for any reason, such holding shall have the\neffect of invalidating the variance granted and shall render the variance null and void.\n(E) Duration. The variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only. Unless\notherwise specified, construction or operation shall be commenced within 12 months of the date of\nissuance of a variance, or the variance shall become void.\n(Amend. of 11-12-2013)\n9-6. - ENFORCEMENT OFFICER\n9-6.1. - Establishment and authority.\nThe Town Council has appointed the Guilford County Planning and Development Department to\n"}, {"page": "284", "text": "administer and enforce the provisions of this Ordinance.
