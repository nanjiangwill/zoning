However, in\nthis case, construction of the development may not begin, no\nbuilding permits may be issued, and final plat approval for\nsubdivisions may not be given until the commission approves\nthe erosion control plan.\nB.\nFor the purposes of this section, land disturbing activity means any use\nof the land by any person in residential, industrial, educational,\ninstitutional, or commercial development, highway and street\nconstruction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural\ncover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation\nexcept activities that are exempt under NCGS $113A-52.01.\nSedimentation occurs whenever solid particulate matter, mineral or\norganic, is transported by water, air, gravity, or ice from the site of its\norigin.\n6.7 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION\nAll development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage according to the\nprovisions of Chapter 12 of this Ordinance. All development proposals shall have public facilities such as\nsewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. All\nsubdivisions and developments shall have adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.\n6.8 STREET NAME SIGNS\nAppropriate street name signs which meet the standard City of Oxford specifications shall be placed at\nall street intersections.

Every lot shall have access that is sufficient to afford a reasonable\nmeans of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all\nthose likely to need or desire access to the property for its intended use.\nB. The creation of new flag lots shall be permissible only under the\nfollowing circumstances:\n1. Flag lots may be created only:\ni. To avoid providing direct access onto a collector street, minor\nthoroughfare, or major thoroughfare; or\nii. When a property owner demonstrates that, because of the\nirregular shape of a tract, its difficult topography, or for\nsome other substantial reason, the creation of a flag lot is\nreasonably necessary to avoid extreme hardship to the\nproperty owner and can be accomplished without creating\nsubstantially adverse effects on neighboring properties or\nthe public health and safety.\nC. Under no circumstances may a flag lot be created if the effect is to\nincrease the number of access points onto a major or minor\nthoroughfare.\nD. That portion of a flag lot between the street onto which it has access\nand the point where the lot dimension parallel to the street first equals\nor exceeds the presumptive lot width set forth in Chapter 2 of this\nOrdinance (or the widest part of the lot if the maximum width is less\nthan the presumptive minimum) may not be longer than 200 feet.\n6.12.2 ACCESS TO MAJOR OR MINOR THOROUGHFARES\nA. Whenever a tract proposed for subdivision borders on or contains an\nexisting or proposed major or minor thoroughfare, then all lots created\nout of such tract must have sufficient frontage on another street, either\npre-existing or created as part of the subdivision, so that direct access to\nsuch lot need not be provided by the major or minor thoroughfare,\nunless compliance with this requirement is not reasonable due to the\nsize and shape of the tract to be divided.

The following provisions are an attempt to\nprotect the public interest and safety of highway users by achieving\naccess control when that objective is not achieved under $6.12.2.A\neither because a proposed development is not a subdivision or because\ncompliance with that Section is not reasonably practicable.\n1. The term \"access control\" refers to all techniques intended to\nminimize the traffic interference associated with driveway\naccess, whether the use is commercial, industrial, or residential.\n2. To separate basic conflict areas and gain some semblance of\naccess control, techniques which allow the reduction of\ndriveway numbers or directly increase the spacing between\ndriveways or between driveways and intersections will be\nrequired to the extent reasonably practicable to achieve the\nfollowing limitations for driveway access in relation to highway\nfrontage:\nC. Where highway speed is 55 mph, driveway spacing shall be at 300-foot\nintervals or greater. Where highway speed is 45 mph, spacing shall be\nat 230-foot intervals or greater.\nD. Adjacent or adjoining lots with highway frontages that do not meet the\nminimums described in this Section are encouraged to combine access\nto one driveway.\nE.\nWhere separate or single parcels are assembled under one purpose,\nplan, entity, or usage, consolidation of existing direct access shall be\nrequired to the extent feasible.

Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets\nare required by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended,\nand the street developed, to the property line of the property being\ndeveloped (or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a\nsingle tract) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or\nproposed street is expected.

Stormwater Management: It has been determined that development\nand redevelopment can alter the hydrologic response of local\nwatersheds and increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes,\nflooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point\nsource pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as\nreducing groundwater recharge. These changes in stormwater runoff\ncontribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and\nalterations in hydrology which are harmful to the public health and\nsafety as well as to the natural environment. These effects can be\nmanaged and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned\ncontrols to manage stormwater runoff from development sites.\nFurther, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (\"Clean Water\nAct\") and federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized\nareas, including the City of Oxford, to adopt stormwater controls such\nas those included in this Chapter.\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nB. Erosion and Sedimentation Control: The erosion of soil from\nunstabilized development sites has adverse impacts on the condition of\npublic and private property, impairs the City of Oxford stormwater\nsystem, and causes pollution and accelerated siltation of lakes, streams,\nand other watercourses. Pursuant to the North Carolina Sedimentation\nPollution Control Act of 1973, as amended, the City of Oxford has been\ndirected to implement an erosion and sedimentation control program\nas outlined in this Chapter.\nCELL (3, 1): \n11.1.2 PURPOSE\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nA.

Development Agreements are intended to implement and be consistent\nwith the goals and objectives of the City of Oxford.\nB. The objective of this Section is accomplished by authorizing\nDevelopment Agreements in which a developer and the City of Oxford\nmay ensure the adequacy of public facilities and encourage sound\ncapital improvements planning while providing certainty in the process\nof obtaining development approval and reducing the economic costs of\ndevelopment by providing greater regulatory certainty.\nC. The purpose of this Section is to establish standards and procedures for\nentering into Development Agreements for long-term, large-scale\ndevelopments with the following statements of intent:\n1. Large-scale development projects often occur in multiple\nphases extending over a period of years, requiring long-term\ncommitment of both public and private resources.\n2. Such large-scale developments often create potential\ncommunity impacts that are difficult to accommodate within\nthe traditional zoning process.\n3. Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects\noften require careful integration between public capital facilities\nplanning, financing, and construction schedules and the phasing\nof the private development.\n4.\nBecause of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects\ninvolve substantial commitments of private capital by private\ndevelopers, which private developers are unwilling to risk\nwithout sufficient assurances that development standards will\nremain stable through the extended period of the development.\n5. Because of their size and duration, such developments often\npermit communities and developers to experiment with\ndifferent or nontraditional types of development concepts and\nstandards, while still managing the impacts on surrounding\nareas.\nCITY OF OXFORD UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE |Adopted July 1, 2021\nPage\n306\n"}, {"page": "315", "text": "CHAPTER 15: Administration and Development Review Processes\n15.9 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS\n6.

In entering into such an agreement, the City may not exercise\nany authority or make any commitment not authorized by general or\nlocal act and may not impose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise\napplicable law.
