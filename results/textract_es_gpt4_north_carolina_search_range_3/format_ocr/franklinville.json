This ordinance serves as a guide for the community in making land\ndevelopment decisions and will help to provide for the orderly growth and development of the Town.\nThe ordinance will be reviewed and revised periodically by the Board of Town Commissioners, after\nformal adoption, as conditions within the Town's planning jurisdiction change over time.\nFranklinville adopted the Franklinville Community Plan in 2001. This plan provides a vision for\nfuture development that accommodates physical and economic expansion, while protecting the\ncommunity's valuable natural, cultural, and historic assets. As growth is managed in accord\nwith this vision, well-planned land development will maintain and enhance Franklinville's\ntraditional character. As a tool for implementing the plan, this ordinance provides flexible\nregulations and incentives that respect private property rights while encouraging growth that\nmaximizes the town's investment in infrastructure and protects key conservation areas. This\nordinance calls for detailed site analyses of proposed land development projects to make sure\nthey are properly located and fit the natural landscape and existing surrounding uses. Detailed\ndesign guidelines are provided to encourage the development of inter-connected, pedestrian-\nfriendly neighborhoods with a healthy mixture of land uses and vibrant public spaces.\nTo address and prevent the negative consequences of conventional development patterns, this\nordinance draws from a variety of modern \"new urbanist\" development regulations adopted by\nsmall communities throughout North Carolina - especially the Towns of Davidson, Cornelius,\nHuntersville, and Mocksville. This ordinance goes beyond providing the minimum regulations\nnecessary to facilitate safe and orderly growth, by advocating more traditional and sustainable\nplanning and development practices that encourage the types and patterns of land development\nthat will preserve and enhance what is best about our community. Through careful planning of\nthe physical design of our town, our hope is that future growth will be integrated into the fabric of\nour community to form coherent, functional neighborhoods and activity centers; to increase our\ncommunity security and identity; to enhance the quality of life in our town; and to encourage the\ngreatest possible economic and social benefits for all residents.\nAdopted this\nday of\n, 2002 by the Franklinville Board of Town Commissioners.\nTown of Franklinville\ni\nLand Development Ordinance\nCELL (1, 1): \nBoard of Town Commissioners\nCELL (1, 2): \nPlanning and Zoning Board Members\nCELL (2, 1): \nL.

Purpose and Principles\n1.1 Purpose\nThe Town of Franklinville, North Carolina adopted its first comprehensive plan in Spring of 2001.\nThe plan, officially titled \"The Franklinville Community Plan,\" contains a broad range of goals\nand policies regarding land development in and around the town. The Community Plan serves\nas a guide for the future growth of the community into the 21st Century. In accordance with\nNorth Carolina General Statute 160A-383, the purpose of this ordinance is to implement the\ngoals and policies of the Franklinville Community Plan, designed to:\nlessen congestion in the streets\nsecure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers\npromote the health and general welfare\nprovide adequate light and air\nprevent overcrowding of land\navoid undue concentration of population\nfacilitate the adequate provision and economic provision of transportation, water,\nsewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements\nconserve the value of buildings\nencourage the most appropriate use of land within the Town's corporate limits and its\nextraterritorial planning and zoning jurisdiction.\n1.2 General Principles\nThe Town of Franklinville took its present form during the 19th century as an industrial mill\nvillage along the Deep River. Two textile mills were built, utilizing power from the river to drive\nthe looms. Housing and services for the workers were spread over the surrounding hills on the\nnorth side of the river. The railroad from Greensboro to Southern Pines followed the river\ncourse, crossing from side to side as the river wound among the hills. The mills are now closed\nand the railroad tracks are torn up. However, the community persists and is looking forward to a\nperiod of revival, growth, and change. The original form of the town has been essentially\npreserved and spared the impact of contemporary sprawl development. In fact, the town's\ncharacter and charm is one of its most valuable public assets. The town's key challenge is to\nmanage this impending growth and change without sacrificing the way of life and physical\ncharacter that make Franklinville such a unique and charming place to live and work.\nThe Franklinville Community Plan provides a vision for the future growth and development of\nthe town. The plan seeks to accommodate the physical and economic expansion expected over\nthe next quarter century, while protecting the community's valuable natural, cultural, and historic\nassets. As growth is managed in accord with this long-range vision, it will encourage and guide\nwell-planned land development and infrastructure that maintains and enhances Franklinville's\ntraditional character. The plan identifies the environmental and physical design characteristics\nthat contribute to the uniqueness and quality of life that our citizens want to conserve and\nimprove. The plan provides the following four broad principles for accommodating growth while\npreserving our local heritage, natural environment, rural character, and quality of life:\n1. Locate and cluster new land development in the most buildable areas on the water-\nspreading uplands, maintaining the lower-lying water-gathering slopes as green space to\nfilter runoff, minimize erosion and flooding, provide open land for people and wildlife, and to\ncreate a desirable physical environment in which to live and work.\nTown of Franklinville\n1\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "2. Locate most roads and streets along the ridges of hills to serve buildable areas along upland\nslopes, while retaining wooded buffers and open land along stream corridors.\n3. Maintain the open land along stream corridors (both public and private), to serve as a\ncontinuous backdrop for the built parts of town, and to provide a natural vegetated buffer to\nslow and filter runoff from buildings, streets and lawns, before it enters streams.\n4. Use the town's traditional land use patterns as the model for future land development, to\nestablish sustainable clusters of homes and businesses that maintain and enhance the\nrural, small town character and charm of Franklinville.\n1.3 Specific Goals\nProper planning and regulation of land development is the duty of all communities that care\nabout providing a high quality of life for their citizens. Our challenge as a small town is to\nregulate land development to preserve and enhance what is best about Franklinville, while\nencouraging the creation of new, more livable neighborhoods. The original intent of planning is\nto regulate parcel sizes and building setbacks to protect the public health, safety and welfare.\nOver time the primary aim of conventional planning has become the segregation of conflicting\nuses, by dividing a jurisdiction into districts based on present and desired future uses. By\nprotecting existing conditions, planning seeks to protect the future value of property and gives\nhomeowners peace of mind. Conventional planning ordinances usually consist of \"use\" lists and\nmaps which specify, for instance, that single-family residences, schools and churches are\ncompatible and can be located in the same planning district, but commercial and industrial uses\nare inappropriate or disruptive and must be put in another section of the community. In rural\nareas, on the other hand, distance theoretically buffers incompatible uses.\nNo community actively plans to make a small town into a bland suburb. However, many\nplanning and subdivision ordinances produce exactly that outcome, allowing the systematic\nconversion of most buildable land into standardized subdivisions of residential lots and streets\nwith little or no open space or other neighborhood amenities. The underlying mission of the\ncommittee that developed the Franklinville Community Plan was: \"To create a friendly, thriving\nenvironment for Franklinville by preserving and enhancing its distinctive characteristics while\nimproving its appearance, infrastructure, and economy.\" As a tool for implementing the\nCommunity Plan, one of the primary goals of this new land development ordinance is to meet\nthe infrastructure needs of future growth while providing for a logical balance between\ncommunity and private landowner interests. The Franklinville Community Plan establishes\nreasonable community goals for conservation and development that reflect local resources,\nexisting land uses, anticipated growth patterns, private landowner interests and public policies.\nThis new ordinance provides flexible regulations and incentives that respect private property\nrights while encouraging new development be designed to maximize the town's investment in\ninfrastructure and to permanently protect conservation areas. This ordinance calls for detailed\nsite analyses of proposed land development projects to make sure they are properly located\nand fit the natural landscape and existing surrounding uses. Design guidelines are provided for\nlots, streets, buildings, and utilities to encourage the development of inter-connected,\npedestrian-friendly neighborhoods and communities with mixed land uses and useful public\nspaces.\nPatterns of sprawling, large-lot development established under conventional planning schemes\nhave seriously compromised the quality of life and economic viability of communities all across\nour nation. Conventional planning and planning practices have encouraged segregation of land\nuses into single-use zones, leading to the creation of exclusively residential, auto-dependent\nTown of Franklinville\n2\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "subdivisions, separating residents from shopping centers, civic uses, and business parks. This\npractice has often resulted in wide-spread loss of open space, farmland, and forest cover;\nincreased traffic congestion and air pollution; environmental degradation; increased stormwater\nrunoff, soil erosion, and water supply contamination; increased housing and infrastructure costs;\ninadequate provision of schools and public services; and declines in property value and quality\nof life.\nTo address and prevent the negative consequences of conventional development patterns, this\nnew ordinance draws from a variety of modern \"new urbanist\" development regulations adopted\nby small towns throughout North Carolina. This ordinance goes beyond providing the minimum\nregulations necessary to facilitate safe and orderly growth, by advocating more traditional and\nsustainable planning and development practices that encourage the types and patterns of land\ndevelopment that will preserve and enhance what is best about our small community. Through\ncareful planning of the physical design of our town, future growth will be integrated into the\nfabric of our community to form coherent, functional neighborhoods and activity centers; to\nincrease our community security and identity; to enhance the quality of life for the entire town;\nand to encourage the greatest possible economic and social benefits for all residents.\nBorrowed from the Town of Davidson Planning Ordinance, the following goals were adapted by\nthe Town to serve as guiding principles for accomplishing the broad planning objectives of the\nFranklinville Community Plan:\nWe will preserve Franklinville's status as a small town - The essence of a small town is that\nresidents know their neighbors and interact with them in a variety of well-designed settings.\nMore than any other force, this small-town essence will attract new residents and visitors to\nFranklinville. But resulting growth may threaten the atmosphere that attracts new residents in\nthe first place. In order to prevent the destruction of what we love, we will avoid large-lot sprawl\ntype development, totally automobile-dependent development, enclave development that puts\npeople into protected areas where their fellow residents are unwelcome, and development at\nsuch a pace that we are unable to assimilate new residents into the life of the Town.\nWe will preserve and enhance Franklinville's unique village center - The presence of an\nidentifiable village center contributes to the quality of life in our community. We can keep this\nvaluable asset by enhancing the village center with new shops and offices, a new transit\nsystem, and, especially, new residences for people downtown. This principle does not mean,\nhowever, that the village center should have a monopoly on the commercial life of the town.\nHaving scattered commercial opportunities throughout our jurisdiction actually enhances the\ndowntown, by preventing the choking of downtown with ever more cars.\nFuture growth will be sustainable - Too often in the past, both in Franklinville and, indeed in\nthe entire country, growth has been totally dependent on the private passenger automobile.\nThe result has been roads choked with vehicles and air befouled with their wastes. Such\ndevelopment is clearly not sustainable. Thus this ordinance aims to reduce the reliance on the\nprivate passenger automobile, and to enhance the alternatives: walking, bicycling, and riding\npublic transit. There are two corollaries to this principle:\nMuch of the new growth will be in walkable, mixed use communities - In order to reduce\nthe dependence on the private passenger automobile, public policy must allow people to live,\nwork, shop, visit, pray, and attend school in one area. These activities are not to exclude\nparticipation in the life of the whole town, since to do so would violate our first principles of\npreserving the small town; rather, we want to make it possible to do some of life's activities\nwithout getting into our cars.\nTown of Franklinville\n3\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "10", "text": "Old neighborhoods will be interconnected via new streets and greenways, and new\nneighborhoods will connect to adjacent neighborhoods and undeveloped property - By\nhaving a grid of streets and a complete greenway system, rather than a few arterial streets that\nmust carry most of the transportation burden, we will make walking and bicycling more possible,\nand reduce the length of trips that we take in our cars. And we enhance the sense of community\nin\nFranklinville by making neighborhoods integral parts of the Town instead of cul-de-sac\nhideaways.\nWe will preserve substantial amounts of open space - Our rural area enhances our quality-\nof-life. We will go to great efforts to preserve rural views, as well as saving significant hardwood\nforests, farmland, wildlife habitats, rock outcroppings, parkland, and watersheds in pristine form.\nDoing so enhances our lives, but more importantly, it preserves an irreplaceable asset for future\ngenerations. It is the task of government to preserve open space, and we do so with a variety of\napproaches.\nWe will preserve our diversity of people - Having diverse groups of people in Franklinville -\nall ages, all economic levels, all races and ethnic groups - has long been a major contributor to\nour village. In order to preserve this diversity, this ordinance provides for a mixture of housing\ntypes and prices, since it is the one-product housing type that kills diversity. The ordinance also\nprovides for a mix of housing types to exist in each neighborhood. The town will actively\ndiscourage development that is predicated on having only people of similar socio-economic\nstatus living together.\nThe pace of residential growth will not outstrip the ability of the community to provide for\nthe other parts of life - In many areas, residential growth has been so rapid that the\ncommunities have not been able to provide transportation, schools, utilities, commercial life,\nreligious life, and job opportunities apace with the residential growth. Hence new residents must\nleave their homeplace to find these opportunities, and often they must do so on roads that\nbarely permit the travel. This ordinance, together with the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance,\nseeks to avoid this situation. It is our intent that all parts of a vibrant, successful community\ngrow together.\nWe will rely on a unique combination of private property rights and the health of the\ncommunity as a whole - Government plays a crucial role in the development process. While\ndeeply respecting the rights of private property owners, town government in Franklinville sets\nthe rules for implementation of those rights. In so doing, we preserve land values, deal with the\nlarger picture instead of just the immediate neighborhood that the landowner and developer\nconsider, maintain the high quality of life for the new and current residents, and protect the\nhealth and safety of our people. This role of government obviously can produce tensions with\nlandowners. We recognize those tensions as an integral part of the role of government.\nArchitecture and land development planning will enhance the quality of life in our town -\nWell-designed buildings and streets in well-planned communities can bring us together and\nmake life better. Alternatively, bad design in a poorly planned place can separate us and make\nlife less attractive. Integral to this ordinance, therefore, is the deep belief that good architecture,\nstreet design, and planning are key to the quality of life of our present and future residents. We\nalso labor under the knowledge that we only have one chance to build our town; we want to get\nit right the first time. There are, again, two corollaries to this principle.\nTown of Franklinville\n4\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "11", "text": "CELL (1, 1): \nDesign is more important than density - This ordinance relies heavily on the implementation\nof good principles of design, and relies less on indicators normally employed in land\ndevelopment ordinances.

Therefore, the conventional terminology of\n\"zoning district\" has been replaced with \"planning district.\" These planning districts have the\nsame legal authority as zoning districts. The following general planning districts are established\nas shown in the table below. Reclassification of property to any general planning district is\nconsidered under the administrative procedures outlined in Chapter 9. The requirements of\neach general planning district are established in Chapter 4.\n3.2\nOverlay Districts Established\nOverlay districts are established as a separate set of regulations applicable to specific\ngeographic areas. An overlay district may allow additional uses, restrict permitted uses, or\nimpose development requirements differing from those in the underlying planning district. The\nunderlying planning districts and overlay districts together are used in tandem to manage land\ndevelopment. Overlay districts take precedence over underlying planning districts if there is a\nconflict. The requirements of each overlay district are set forth in Chapter 4.\n3.3 Interpretation of Planning District Boundaries\nThe Town of Franklinville Land Development Ordinance Map, as adopted by the Town of\nFranklinville Board of Commissioners and certified by the Land Development Ordinance\nAdministrator, establishes the official planning districts and overlay districts.

Southern mill villages, like\nFranklinville, provide examples of how these buildings can reasonably coexist with other\nbusinesses and homes.\nStorefront building: Storefront buildings may accommodate a variety of uses. A group of\nstorefront buildings can be combined to form a mixed-use neighborhood center.\nIndividual\nstorefront buildings can provide limited commercial services close to homes.\nCivic building: Civic buildings are used for public purposes. These buildings should be\ndesigned appropriately to fit within neighborhoods as integral parts of the community. Their\nuses include churches, libraries, post offices, and schools.\nLive/Work units: Live/work units combine commercial, office, and residential uses within a\nsingle dwelling unit of two or more stories.\nApartment buildings: Apartment buildings are residential buildings accommodating several\nhouseholds. When well designed, this building type can coexist with a variety of other\nresidential building types.\nAttached houses: Rowhouses and townhouses are attached houses. Their scale can range\nfrom duplexes (two attached units) to a longer series of attached residences.\nDetached houses: The dominant residence type in Franklinville, detached houses are\nsuitable for single-family occupancy.\nTown of Franklinville\n12\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "19", "text": "CHAPTER 4 - Planning District Requirements\n4.1\nRural Residential Planning District (RR)\n4.1.1 Intent\nThe Rural Residential Planning District is provided to preserve the rural appearance and the\nproductive agricultural uses found in outlying areas of the Town's jurisdiction, by clustering\ndevelopment and retaining important natural and rural heritage features. The development of\ncompact neighborhoods and clustering of rural uses is strongly encouraged, to set aside\nsignificant natural areas, vistas, and landscape features for permanent conservation.

A base density of one residential unit per acre is\npermitted, when a minimum of 30% of the site is preserved as open space, and the\ndevelopment is provided with community water and sewer services. This option also\nprovides density bonus incentives to encourage developers to increase the amount of open\nspace accessible to the public, and to participate in the cost of extending municipal water\nand sewer services. The location and configuration of building sites will be determined\nthrough an environmental inventory that identifies landscape features to be preserved and\nthe surrounding rural character to be matched.\nConventional Residential Subdivision - This option permits a base density of one dwelling\nunit per two acres when a minimum of 15% of the site is preserved as open space, and\neach lot utilizes an individual well and septic system. No density bonuses are provided for\nthis option. Building sites will be determined through an environmental inventory that\nidentifies and preserves primary conservation areas. No minimum or maximum lot size is\nrequired if the project meets all other standards of the zoning district and the regulations in\nthis ordinance pertaining to the design of streets, buildings, landscaping, greenways, and\nopen space.\n4.1.3.2\nDevelopment Intensity\nThe number of housing units and size of building lots permitted in Rural Residential District\nsubdivisions varies according to the type of development and amount of open space preserved.\nWhen the conventional subdivision option is used, a base density of one dwelling unit per\ntwo acres, calculated across the entire project, is permitted with the preservation of 15%\nopen space.\nWhen the preferred rural cluster development option is used, a base density of one dwelling\nunit per acre, calculated across the entire project, is permitted with the preservation of 30%\nopen space. Building sites will be clustered on the remaining portion of the land.

Selected elements of the Watershed Protection\nOrdinance are summarized and modified below, to provide easy reference to key regulations.\n4.9.1 Intent\nThe purpose and intent of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Ordinance is to protect the\nTown's public water supply from pollution and contamination, by regulating the development and\nland use density in the surrounding land area (watershed) draining into the Sandy Ridge reservoir.\nWatershed regulations help limit exposure to non-point source (not from a pipe) pollution that\ncontributes biological contamination, turbidity (from soil erosion and sedimentation), nutrient\nloading and heavy metal pollution; all of which may endanger the water supplies that provide\ndrinking water to the Town. These regulations limit the amount of impervious surface allowed\nwithin the watershed overlay district. The number of dwelling units per acre is reduced to help\npreserve and protect environmentally sensitive areas. As required by the Water Supply\nWatershed Protection Act of 1989 (G.S. 143-214.5), the State of North Carolina has classified\nthe Sandy Ridge watershed within the Town's jurisdiction as \"WS III\" - a protected water supply\nthat is moderately developed.\n4.9.2 Applicability\nTo provide an additional layer of protection for the Town's drinking water supply, the watershed\nprotection ordinance establishes two watershed overlay districts. The land area nearest the water\nsupply intake is designated as the \"Critical Area\" (Sandy Creek - WS-III-CA) and has the higher\nlevel of regulation because its proximity to the intake provides a higher risk of contamination. The\nremaining portion is designated as the \"Balance of Watershed\" (Sandy Creek - WS-III-BW) and\nhas fewer development restrictions because its greater distance from the point of intake lowers its\nrisk of contamination.\nWatershed overlay districts apply to areas within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction\n(ETJ) of Franklinville designated as Public Water Supply Watersheds by the N.C. Environmental\nManagement Commission (EMC) and as defined and established on a map entitled, \"Watershed\nProtection Map of Franklinville, North Carolina\". The geographic boundaries contained on the\nWatershed Map, and all explanatory matter contained within the previously adopted Water Supply\nWatershed Protection Ordinance are hereby made a part of this Land Development Ordinance.\n4.9.3 Exceptions to Applicability\nA. The Watershed Overlay District imposes an additional layer of regulation over existing\nzoning requirements. When a conflict occurs between the zoning district standards and the\noverlay standards the more restrictive shall prevail. Under no condition will development be\npermitted in the designated drinking supply watershed that violates the Water Supply\nWatershed Protection Rules as adopted by the EMC on 5/29/92 including amendments.\nB.\nAll land use activities shall conform to the watershed overlay district regulations except that\nexisting development is not subject to the requirements of this Section. Expansions to\nstructures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of this Section,\nhowever, the built upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in\nthe density calculations.\nTown of Franklinville\n53\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "4.9.4 Development Regulations\n4.9.4.1\nSandy Creek Watershed - Critical Area (WS-III-CA)\nIn order to maintain a low land use intensity pattern, single family residential uses are allowed at a\nmaximum of one (1) dwelling unit per three (3) acres.

The center includes a covered\narea for a future transit stop.\nC. The structure of the neighborhood should progress from urban to rural. The urban areas\nhave more density, larger and taller buildings, and streets and alleys, while the rural area\nhas less density, smaller buildings and more picturesque landscaping. The dense urban\ncore transitions out to the rural area through a series of zones that are progressively less\ndense.\nD.

Design regulations are not intended to promote the replication of the existing built form of\nFranklinville, but to allow imaginative design that is respectful of its neighborhood. The\nregulations are meant to help achieve good design, not a certain stylistic result. They will\nalso establish a consistent framework for submitting and assessing proposed development.\nB. New downtown buildings should be designed to be respectful in context to the existing built\nenvironment not as explicit reproductions of past historical styles. This regulation does not\npreclude use of materials, scale or massing found on older buildings. Spatial elements like\nmassing, proportions, scale, setbacks, spaces between buildings, and their relative positions\nshould be used to integrate new development into existing neighborhoods.\nC.\nBuildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building itself as advertising will be\ndiscouraged, particularly where the proposed architecture is the result of a \"corporate\" or\nfranchise style. New construction should provide variety and diversity and express its own\nuniqueness of structure, location or tenant.\n6.3.2 Mass, scale and proportion\nA. Height can lend a building dignity and grace. Conversely, it can contribute to unacceptable\nbulk and dominance. It is the height in combination with other features, including setbacks\nand the location and amount of parking, that results in a positive or negative outcome. The\nheight and scale of each building will take into consideration its site and existing (or\nanticipated) neighboring buildings which includes those on properties behind a proposed\nbuilding and beyond the immediately adjacent neighbors.\nTown of Franklinville\n28\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "B. Windows, doors, columns, leaves, parapets, and other building components will be\nproportional to the overall scale of the building.\nC. Changes of plane should have clearly delineated material transitions.\n6.3.3 Street Rhythm\nA. Facades along primary streets will be individually interesting, yet fit well into the streetscape.\nB. Important street vistas should terminate in a focal point, such as a building or other\narchitectural or natural feature.\n6.3.4 Roof Form and Pitch\nA. Rooflines will accommodate simple lines such as hip, flat, shed, gable to front, or gable to\nside, and avoid excessive articulation.\nB. Mansard roofs will have functional dormers which project out from the roof. Dormers will\nhave a symmetrical gable or hip roof.\n6.3.5 Fa\u00e7ade Articulation and Detailing\nA.\nArchitectural elements like openings, sill details, bulkhead, posts, and other architectural\nfeatures will be used to establish human scale at the street level.\nB. Buildings will avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible\nfacades. Building wall offsets, including projections, recesses, and changes in floor level will\nbe used in order to: add architectural interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of a single,\nlong wall; and subdivide the wall into human size proportions. Similarly, roofline offsets will\nbe provided to lend architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to\nrelieve the effect of a single, long roof.

For Example: In a 100-\nacre subdivision requiring a minimum of 30% open space, but actually containing 55% open\nspace, the developer would receive one unit per acre by right (100 units), plus a bonus of 25\nadditional units (0.25 100 = 25).\nB. Public Access Incentive: A density bonus is provided to encourage more public access to\nopen space. Public access means preserved open space is permanently accessible, legally\nand physically, by all citizens and residents of the Town and its ETJ. To receive a bonus for\npublicly accessible open space, the Town Board must approve the location of land with\npublic access. For each 10% increment of publicly accessible open space, the number of\nby-right units in the project may be increased by 1%. For Example: In a 100-acre\nsubdivision, if 100% of the preserved open space is made accessible to the general public,\nthe developer would receive one unit per acre by right (100 units), plus a bonus of 10\nadditional units (0.10 X 100 = 10).\nC. Infrastructure Investment Incentive: An additional density bonus is provided to encourage\nmore private participation in the cost of extending the Town's water and sewer services to\nnew development. To receive a bonus for sharing in the cost of extending municipal water\nand sewer services, the Town Board must approve the location and overall design and\nengineering of all proposed infrastructure projects. For each 10% increment of private cost-\nsharing in the extension of municipal water and sewer systems, the number of by-right units\nin the project may be increased by 2%. For Example: In a 100-acre subdivision, if 50% of\nthe cost of extending water and sewer to a new project is paid for privately, the developer\nwould receive one unit per acre by right (100 units), plus a bonus of 10 additional units (0.10\n100 = 10).\nD. Simultaneous Use of Incentives: All three of the incentives outlined above may be used\nsimultaneously. For Example: a 100-acre subdivision containing 55% open space that is\n100% accessible to the public, and with all water and sewer extensions paid for privately,\nthe developer would receive one unit per acre by right (100 units), plus 25 bonus units for\nadditional open space, 10 bonus units for public access to open space, and 10 bonus units\nfor sharing in the cost of extending public water and sewer, for a total of 145 units.\nTown of Franklinville\n39\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "104", "text": "6.5.3\nOpen Space Requirements in All Other Planning Districts\nA.

Franklinville's hierarchical\nstreet network is to be safe, attractive, and friendly for both motorists and pedestrians.\n6.7.2 Defining the Public Space of the Street\nAs the most prevalent public spaces in Franklinville, streets should be spatially defined by\nbuildings. Proper alignment and delineation of the public street space occurs when the facades\nof adjacent buildings are aligned much like the walls forming a room. Buildings that make up the\nstreet edges are aligned in a disciplined manner. The defined space observes a certain ratio of\nheight to width. Building articulation must take place primarily in the vertical plane of the fa\u00e7ade.\nAppendages such as porches, balconies, and bay windows are encouraged to promote the\ntransition between the public street and the private dwelling.\nFor good definition, the ratio of one increment of height to six of width is the absolute maximum,\nwith one to three being a good effective minimum. As a general rule, the tighter the ratio, the\nstronger the sense of place. Very tight relationships of one to one can create special pedestrian\nplaces. In the absence of spatial definition by facades, disciplined tree planting is an alternative.\nTrees aligned for spatial enclosure are necessary on streets with deep building setbacks.\n(Diagram courtesy of the Town of Mocksville Zoning Ordinance)\nTown of Franklinville\n51\nLand Development Ordinance\nCELL (1, 1): \nSpecial\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nRATIO 1:1\nCELL (2, 3): \nRATIO 1:3\nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nRATIO 1:6\nCELL (3, 4): \nMaximum\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nPROPORTIONS\nBY FACADE\nCELL (4, 3): \nBY RECESS LINE\nBY LANDSCAPING\nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nTECHNIQUES\nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "6.7.3 General Street Design Principles\nThe land development ordinance encourages the development of a network of interconnecting\nstreets that disperse traffic while connecting and integrating neighborhoods with the existing\nfabric of our community. Equally as important, this ordinance encourages the development of a\nnetwork of sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and greenways that provide an attractive and safe mode of\ntravel for cyclists and pedestrians. On-street parking is generally encouraged. The following\nstreet design principles encourage streets to be designed and used as critical public spaces by\nboth vehicles and people:\nA. Streets shall interconnect within a development and with adjoining development.\nB. Cul-de-sacs are permitted only where topographic conditions and/or exterior lot line\nconfigurations offer no practical alternatives for connection or through traffic.\nC. Street stubs should be provided with development adjacent to open land to provide for\nfuture connections. Stubs must extend to the neighboring property line.\nD. Streets are the main public space of the Town and shall be scaled to the pedestrian.\nE. Streets are designed to be only as wide as necessary to accommodate the vehicular mix\nserving adjacent land uses, while providing adequate access.\nF. Streets shall be bordered by sidewalks on both sides. The Board of Commissioners may\ngrant exceptions upon recommendation by the Planning Board if it is shown that local\npedestrian traffic on Minor Streets and other non pedestrian-oriented streets warrant their\nlocation on one side only.\nG. Streets shall have street trees planted in a manner appropriate to their function. Commercial\nstreets shall have trees which compliment the face of the buildings and which shade the\nsidewalk. Residential streets shall provide for an appropriate canopy, which shades both the\nstreet and sidewalk, and serves as a visual buffer between the street and the home.\nH. Whenever possible, streets should be designed to fit the contours of the land and should\nminimize removal of significant trees.\nI.\nWhenever a conflict exists among vehicular and pedestrian usage, the conflict should\ngenerally be resolved in favor of the pedestrian unless in the best interest of public safety.\nJ.\nAll streets, whether publicly or privately maintained, shall be constructed in accordance with\nthe design and construction standards in this ordinance and shall be maintained for public\naccess whether by easement or by public dedication.\nK.

Reasonable and necessary extensions may be granted at the Board's sole\ndiscretion if a written request by the sub-divider is made to the Town Board forty-five (45)\ndays prior to the 1-year anniversary of preliminary plat approval. Upon expiration of approval\nprior to final plat approval and recordation, a new application for subdivision will be required\nin accordance with the process before development can recommence.\nC. Approval of a preliminary plat constituting an individual phase of a multi-phase project,\nwhich has not been entirely approved, does not constitute approval by the Town of any\nremaining phases. For approved preliminary plats consisting of multiple phases, only the\nphase that is to be developed for sale immediately shall be submitted for final plat approval.\nD.\nAny substantial changes proposed to an approved preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the\nPlanning Board and approved or denied by the Town Board of Commissioners as amended\nConstruction Documents.\nE. All required infrastructure improvements for the preliminary plat shall be in place within 1\nyear of preliminary plat approval. If circumstances beyond the control of the sub-divider do\nnot allow for the completion of the required work within the 1 year period or the size of the\nphase is such that 1 year is insufficient time to complete all required work, then the sub-\ndivider may file a written request for an extension with Town Board no later than forty-five\n(45) days prior to the 1 year anniversary of preliminary plat approval by the Town as\nprovided above. If infrastructure work is not completed within 1 year and/or no extension\nrequest is filed with Town Board and approved, preliminary plat approval becomes null and\nvoid on the day of the 1-year anniversary and a new application will be required.\nTown of Franklinville\n78\nLand Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "7.7\nRe-Subdivision Procedures\nA.

Any nonconformity created by a\nchange in the classification of property or the text of these regulations will also be regulated by\nthe provisions of this section. Many nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this\nsection are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about\neventual elimination and/or lessen their impact upon surrounding conforming uses in order to\npreserve the integrity of the area in which it is located and the intent of this ordinance.\n10.2 Nonconforming Uses\nNonconforming uses of land or structures, and nonconforming structures that contain\nnonconforming uses, may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this section, but\nthis section will only apply to the extent said nonconformities fully and clearly meet the definition\nof \"non-conforming use\" in Chapter 11 of this Ordinance.\nA. Normal structural repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of a\nnonconforming use. Also, a nonconforming use may be re-established in case of damage to\nthe structure in which it is located (to an extent of less than 60 percent of its assessed value)\ndue to fire or other disaster event pursuant to the issuance of a permit by the LDO\nAdministrator. This will include, as well, the repair or reconstruction of any structure or on-\nsite utility, parking or street infrastructure in support of said nonconforming use. If said\nstructure was also nonconforming, the reconstruction will meet the requirements of the\napplicable planning area. An application must be filed for such building permit no later than\n30 days after the structure has been destroyed or damaged, otherwise the use will not be\nallowed to be rebuilt. The building permit will expire six months after it is issued unless prior\nthereto a substantial beginning of the reconstruction will have occurred and thereafter\ndiligently pursued.\nB. A nonconforming non-residential use will not be expanded, changed or enlarged, nor will\nsuch a nonconforming use be enlarged by additions to the structure in which the\nnonconforming use is located (either attached or detached). However, if a nonconforming\nnon-residential use can expand within the existing structure, it may do so as long as the\nLDO Administrator determines that the interior expansion will not have a negative impact\nupon surrounding conforming uses. Any occupation of additional lands beyond the\nboundaries of the lot on which said nonconforming use is located is prohibited. An existing\nnonconforming residential use may be enlarged or altered. Any such enlargement or\nalteration will be in compliance with all yard requirements and other regulations of such\nstructures as required in the specific planning area.\nC. Once a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it will not thereafter be\nused for any nonconforming use.\nD.\nIf a nonconforming use is abandoned for one hundred-eighty (180) days or more, the use\nwill not be allowed to re-establish. All new uses in said structure will thereafter be\nconforming. If said use is located in a structure which is destroyed (i.e. received damage to\nan extent of more than 60 percent of its assessed value at the time of destruction), a use\nmay only be allowed to re-establish in accordance with the land development ordinance in\neffect in the area in which it is located.
