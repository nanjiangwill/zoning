Enactment.\nAn ordinance establishing comprehensive zoning regulations for the Town of Peletier, North\nCarolina, and providing for the administration, enforcement and amendment thereof, in\naccordance with the provisions of North Carolina General Statues 160D [Planning and\nDevelopment Regulation] inclusive, and for the repeal of any ordinance in conflict herewith.\n1002. Purpose.\nThe Town of Peletier Board of Commissioners deem it necessary for the purpose of promoting\nthe health, safety, morals or general welfare of the Town of Peletier to enact such an Ordinance.\nTo achieve this end, the Board of Commissioners have appointed a Planning Board to\nrecommend the boundaries of the various original districts and appropriate regulations to be\nenforced therein. As such, the Planning Board has divided the Town into districts and has\nprepared regulations pertaining to such districts in accordance with a comprehensive plan and\ndesigned to lessen congestion throughout the Town; to secure safety from fire, panic and other\ndangers; to promote health and the general welfare, to provide adequate light and air; to prevent\novercrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate\nprovision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements. The\nPlanning Board has given reasonable consideration, among other things to the character of the\ndistricts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, with a view to conserving the value of\nbuildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the Town, and the\nPlanning Board has submitted its final report to the Town Board of Commissioners. The Town\nBoard of Commissioners have given due public notice of hearings relating to zoning districts,\nregulations and restrictions, and have held such public hearings, and all requirements of the\nGeneral Statutes of North Carolina with regard to the preparation of the report of the Planning\nCommission and subsequent action of the Town Commissioner have been met.\n1003.

The Zoning Map and notations thereon are hereby designated, established, and\nincorporated as a part of these regulations and shall be as much a part of these regulations as if\nthey were fully described herein. The maps may be in paper or a digital format approved by the\ntown and may be reproduced by any method of reproduction that gives legible and permanent\ncopies and, when certified by the town clerk in accordance with G.S. 160A-79 shall be\nadmissible into evidence and shall have the same force and effect as would the original map.\n1\n"}, {"page": "4", "text": "Development regulations adopted pursuant to this ordinance may reference or incorporate by\nreference flood insurance rate maps, watershed boundary maps, or other maps officially adopted\nor promulgated by State and federal agencies. For these maps a regulation text or zoning map\nmay reference a specific officially adopted map or may incorporate by reference the most recent\nofficially adopted version of such maps.\nWhen zoning district boundaries are based on these maps, the regulation may provide that the\nzoning district boundaries are automatically amended to remain consistent with changes in the\nofficially promulgated State or federal maps, provided a copy of the currently effective version\nof any incorporated map shall be maintained for public inspection as provided in subsection this\nsection.\n1004. Permit Choice & Vested Rights.\nGeneral. Per G.S. 160D-108, the General Assembly recognizes that local government approval of\ndevelopment typically follows significant investment in site evaluation, planning, development\ncosts, consultant fees, and related expenses. The General Assembly finds that it is necessary and\ndesirable to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in order to ensure reasonable\ncertainty, stability, and fairness in the development regulation process, to secure the reasonable\nexpectations of landowners, and to foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in\nland-use planning and development regulation.\nPermit Choice. If a land development regulation is amended between the time a development\npermit application was submitted and a development permit decision is made or if a land\ndevelopment regulation is amended after a development permit decision has been challenged and\nfound to be wrongfully denied or illegal, G.S. 143-755 applies.\nProcess to Claim Vested Right. Per G.S. 160D-108, a person claiming a statutory or common law\nvested right may submit information to substantiate that claim to the administrative officer or\nother agency designated by this ordinance, who shall make an initial determination as to the\nexistence of the vested right. The decision of the zoning administrative officer may be appealed\nto the under G.S. 160D-405. On appeal, the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de\nnovo. In lieu of seeking such a determination or pursuing an appeal under G.S. 160D-405, a\nperson claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by G.S. 160D-\n1403.1\n1005. Planning and Development Regulation Jurisdiction.\nThe geographic area defined in Part 2 of G.S. 160D within the town may undertake planning and\napply the development regulations authorized by G.S. 160D where these regulations shall govern\nthe development and use of land and structures.\n1006. Interpretation of Zoning Maps.\n2\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts shown on the\nmaps cited in Section 1004, the following rules will be used to interpret the maps:\n1006.1 In cases where a zoning boundary line is located within a street or alley right-of-\nway, railroad or utility right-of-way or easement, canal, navigable or un- navigable water\nbody, it will be considered to be in the center of the street or alley right-of-way, railroad\nor utility easement, canal or water body. If the actual location of such right- of-way,\neasement, canal or water body varies slightly from the location as shown on the map,\nthen the actual location will control.\n1006.2 Where a zoning district boundary is shown to approximately coincide with a\nproperty line or city limit line, the property line or city limit line will be considered to be\nthe zoning district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.\n1006.3 In cases where a district boundary does not coincide or approximately coincide\nwith any street or alley, railroad, water body or canal, or property line, and no dimensions\nare shown, the location of the boundary will be determined by the use of the scale\nappearing on the map.\n1006.4 In instances where none of the above methods are sufficient to resolve the\nboundary location by the Zoning Enforcement Officer, The Board of Adjustment shall be\nempowered to interpret the intent of the zoning map as to the location of district\nboundaries in case any further uncertainty exists.\n1007.

Rounding Off Fractions.\nWhen a requirement of this ordinance results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half or\nmore will be rounded off and considered a whole unit. Fractions of less than one-half will be\nrounded off to the nearest lower number of units. For example, when the determination of the\nnumber of dwelling units permitted on a lot results in a fraction of a dwelling unit, a fraction of\none-half or more will be considered a dwelling unit and a fraction of less than one-half will be\ndisregarded.\n1011. Lots Divided by Zoning District Boundaries.\nIn the event that a zoning district boundary line on the zoning map divides a lot or tract of single\nownership, each part of the lot may only be used in conformity with the regulations established\nby this ordinance for the district in which each part is located. Should such division prove to be\nan impractical application and an unreasonable hardship, the lesser portion of the lot or tract will\nbe regulated the same as the greater portion of the lot or tract; or in the case of an equally divided\nlot or tract, the more restrictive zoning designation applies.\n1012. Reduction of Lot area Prohibited.\nNo lot existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance may be reduced in its dimensions or area\nbelow the minimum requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless\nspecifically authorized by other provisions of this ordinance.\n1013.

Rules of Procedure.\nThe Board of Adjustment will adopt rules and regulations in accordance with N.C.G.S. 160D-\n302 for its own operation necessary to carry out the provisions of this Ordinance. The Zoning\nEnforcement Officer and Town Clerk will maintain copies of the adopted rules for public\ninformation. The Board of Adjustment shall elect a Chairman, Vice-Chairman from its\nmembership who shall serve for a one (1) year term or until his or her successor are elected. The\nVice-Chairman in the absence of the Chairman, may administer oaths and subpoena witnesses.\nThe Board shall also appoint a Secretary who may be a Town Official, a contract appointee, or\nmember of the Zoning Board of Adjustment.\n1403. Duties of the Board of Adjustment.\nThe Board of Adjustment is assigned a certain number of specific duties by this ordinance. Those\nduties are listed below.\n1403.1 Interpretation of the Ordinance.\nThe Board of Adjustment is responsible for interpreting the provisions of the ordinance if there is\na question about the meaning or application of a provision only once a determination is made by\nthe Zoning Enforcement Officer and an appeal is filed.\n1403.2 Administrative Appeals.\nThe Board of Adjustment will hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any\norder, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Any\nperson who feels that his/her legal or property rights may have been affected, or any officer,\ndepartment, board of bureau of Town Commissioners may file such an appeal within 30 days of\nthe decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer.\n1403.3 Variance of the Ordinance Requirements.\nThe Board of Adjustment will hear and decide appeals for variances from the requirements of the\nordinance which relate to the establishment or extension of structures or uses of land. Before a\nvariance request may be granted, the Board must find:\n1)\nThat practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship would result if the strict letter of the\nlaw were followed;\n2)\nThat the variance is in accordance with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance;\n39\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "3)\nThat the public health, safety, and welfare have been assured and substantial justice done.\nThe Board may not grant a variance that would allow the establishment of a use which is not\notherwise permitted in the district, would result in the extension of a nonconforming use, or\nwould change the district boundary or zoning classification of the property in question.\nPer G.S. 160D-705(d), in reaching a decision on a variance request, the Board will be guided by\nthe following principles in its evaluation of conditions that constitute \"practical difficulties or\nunnecessary hardship\":\n1.\nUnnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is not\nnecessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be\nmade of the property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as\nhardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general\npublic, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted when\nnecessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair\nHousing Act for a person with a disability.\n3.\nThe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner.\nThe act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify\nthe granting of a variance is not a self- created hardship.\n4.\nThe requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation,\nsuch that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.\n1403.4 Issuance of Special Use Permits.\nThe Board of Adjustment is responsible for issuing minor special use permits and the Town\nCommissioners is responsible for issuing major special use permits for the uses in the Table of\nPermitted and Special Uses.

A simple majority of\nmembers present is necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any\nadministrative official charged with enforcement of the ordinance, or to decide in favor of the\nperson(s) making an appeal or special use permit.. The Board of Adjustment shall inform the\nparties involved of its decision in writing and the reasons and findings of fact in writing.\n1406. Rehearing.\nThe Board of Adjustment will refuse to hear an appeal or application for a variance which has\nbeen previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in the conditions,\ncircumstances or evidence relating to the matter.\n1407. Fees.\nPetitions for appeals to be considered by the Board of Adjustment must be filed with the Zoning\nEnforcement Officer or Town Clerk and must be in accordance with the Town Fee Schedule.\n1408.

SPECIAL USE PERMITS.\n3301. Purpose.\nThis ordinance provides for certain uses to be located by right in certain districts where the uses\nare compatible with the purpose of the district and with other uses to be with the purpose of the\ndistrict and with other uses to be located in certain districts only by complying with additional\ndevelopment standards to ensure that same compatibility. However, certain uses which are\nbasically in keeping with the intent and purposes of the district may have substantial impacts on\nthe surrounding area and should only be allowed after a review of the specific proposal. In order\nto insure that these uses would be compatible with surrounding development and be in keeping\nwith the purposes of the district in which they are proposed to be place, they are not allowed to\nbe established as a matter of right. They may be established only after a review and approval of\na special use permit as required by this Section.\nWithin the Town of Peletier, certain specific uses have special standards they are required to\nsatisfy in order to obtain approval from the Town of Peletier. In this section there are additional\nrequirements for certain uses that may have a broader impact on adjacent land uses and therefore\nare deemed to be more pertinent to impose even more reasonable restrictions to avoid the\ncreation of any unnecessary ancillary negative secondary affects. In cases where a conflicting\nregulation exists, the most restrictive shall always take precedence.\n3302. Structure.\nUses that require Special use permits vary greatly in their size, characteristics, impact on\nsurrounding properties, impact on public facilities, and relationship to the overall health, safety\nand welfare of the community. Because of this variation, this section establishes two classes of\nspecial use permit uses which group uses together based on their relative size, characteristics and\ncommunity impact. The two classes will be known as MAJOR and MINOR.\n3302.1 Major Special Use Permit. Uses are those uses that, by virtue of the size, impact or\nrelationship to the overall health, safety and general welfare of the community, will be reviewed\nand approved by the Town Board of Commissioners after an evidentiary public hearing. Unless\notherwise stated, all Special use permit applications will be deemed to the MINOR Special use\npermit applications.\n3302.2 Minor Special Use Permit. Uses are those uses which, by virtue of their more limited\nsize, impact or relationship to the overall health, safety and general welfare of the community,\nwill be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.\n3303.
