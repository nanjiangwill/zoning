The Board of Adjustment shall only consider the application and\ncompetent, material, and substantial evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing\nand may grant or deny the Variance requested. In considering all proposed\nvariances to this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall, before making any\nfinding in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variance will not.\na) allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted;\nb) extend, in area, or expand a non-conformance;\nc) change the district boundaries shown on the Zoning Map;\nd) materially diminish or impair established property values within the\nsurrounding area; or\ne) in any other respect impair the public health, safety, morals, and general\nwelfare.\nNo change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate\nconditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are\nreasonably related to the variance.\n5. Findings of Fact. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the\nstrict letter of a zoning regulation, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the\nprovisions of the zoning regulation upon a showing of ALL the following:\na) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the\nregulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the\nvariance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\nb) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property,\nsuch as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal\ncircumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are\ncommon to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis\nfor granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and\nappropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair\nHousing Act for a person with a disability.\nc)\nThe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the\nproperty owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a\nself-created hardship.\nd) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of\nthe regulation, such that public safety is secure and substantial justice is\nachieved.\n6. Conditions. Before granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may attach such\nconditions thereto which are necessary to further ensure the public health, safety,\nmorals and general welfare. Such conditions may address the location, size and\nnature of proposed buildings, structures or uses and any other development criteria\n26\n"}, {"page": "34", "text": "the Board deems appropriate which are in harmony with the spirit and intent of this\nOrdinance.\n7.
