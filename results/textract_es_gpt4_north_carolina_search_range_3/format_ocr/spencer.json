NOTE: In situations where other regulations of this section are more restrictive than\nthe restrictions listed below, the more restrictive regulations must be used.\n(1) Purpose and findings.\n(a) The Board of Aldermen of the Town of Spencer find that the ordinance codified herein\nis\nnecessary in order to protect the town from the potential secondary effects of adult establishments\nincluding crime, the protection of the town's retail trade, the prevention of blighting of neighborhoods\nand the maintenance of property values, protecting and preserving the quality of the town's\nneighborhoods and the town's commercial districts, the protection of the town's quality of life, the\nincreased threat of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and the protection of peace, welfare\nand privacy of persons who patronize adult establishments. Experience in cities and counties within\nand outside of North Carolina including Concord, North Carolina, the County of Los Angeles (1989),\nthe City of Garden Grove (1991) and the cities of Renton, Washington (1976); Seattle, Washington\n(1978); Detroit, Michigan; Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); and Phoenix, Arizona (1979)\nhave demonstrated that such uses have objectionable secondary effects upon immediately adjacent\nresidential and commercial areas.\n(b) Based on the experiences noted above, the following statements are believed to be held\ntrue.\n1. Crime rates tend to be higher in residential areas surrounding adult establishments than in\nindustrial areas surrounding sexually oriented businesses;\n2. Areas within close walking distance of single and multiple family dwellings should be free of\nadult establishments; and\n3. The existence of adult establishments in close proximity to residential areas has been\nshown in some cities to reduce the property values in those residential areas.\n(2) Floor area. Buildings or structures associated with, and containing this type of use shall not\ndevote more than 10% of the gross floor area to the use.\n(3) Signage. Exterior signage shall be limited to five square feet total and shall not contain lewd\nor offensive language, or any sort of sexually explicit graphics.\n(4) Displays.

The following regulations shall apply within the CC commercial corridor\noverlay district:\n(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 155.074, there shall be no required off-street parking\nwithin properties located in the CB district. That notwithstanding, as part of a special use permit\napproval, the Board of Adjustment may require that some or all of the parking requirements of \u00a7\n155.174 are met through the provision of on-street parking and/or dedicated off-street parking facilities\non the lot in question or in a nearby location.\n(2) Off-street parking shall be concentrated in the side and the rear of the lot with preference\ngiven to the rear of the lot to minimize visibility from adjacent public streets. Accordingly, no greater\nthan two rows of parking shall be located to the side of the principal structure. Notwithstanding, the\nZoning Administrator (or the Board of Adjustment in the issuance of a special use permit) may waive\nthis requirement if it is determined that the parking area located in the side yard is adequately\nscreened from the view of motorists and pedestrians of the adjacent public street(s).\n(3) Off-street parking areas shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their\nvehicles to the buildings. This may be achieved by providing a sidewalk at the perimeter of the lot or\nby having designated corridors within the parking area that channel pedestrians from their cars to\nbuilding entryways.\n(F) Building height. The maximum height of any building shall be 50 feet.\n(G) Massing. The following regulations shall apply only to buildings located in the CB central\nbusiness general zoning district:\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/232f828e-80b0-45ab-85a9-dbefe4d4773a/download/\n113/182\n"}, {"page": "114", "text": "6/26/23, 8:24 AM\ntport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/232f828e-80b0-45ab-85a9-dbefe4d4773a/download/\n(1) The maximum building height to width ratio shall be 1:3. (NOTE: Thus, a building with a height\nof 20 feet can have a maximum building width (as measured parallel to the adjoining public street) of\n60 feet. (see also \"building articulation\".)\n(2) Faades of buildings having a massing ratio of greater than 1:3 that faces a public street shall\nhave an articulated wall plane that incorporated plane projections or recesses to create an interesting\nand attractive architectural design which is comprised of more than flat walls with minimal features.\nAny wall offsets designed to meet this requirement shall have a minimum projection or recess depth of\ntwo feet and a minimum width of two feet. Door inserts shall not be counted as being a \"wall offset.\"\n(H) Building entrances/building orientation/fenestration. Any portion of a building, other than a\nsingle or two-family dwelling, that faces an adjacent street right-of-way shall be considered a building\nfront and shall be subject to the following entrance, orientation and fenestration requirements:\n(1) Pedestrian accessibility to all principal structures within the CC commercial district is strongly\nencouraged. Accordingly, (a) for all principal buildings constructed after the effective date of this\nchapter, (b) for all principal buildings that are physically expanded after the effective date of this\nchapter; and, (c) for all principal buildings whose exterior faades that face or are visible from a public\nstreet are altered after the effective date of this chapter, such buildings shall install a pedestrian\nentryway opening to a public street. Access from the adjoining public sidewalk, street right-of-way or\ndriveway to the principal structure shall be provided through an improved surface. All such new,\nexpanded or altered principal structures shall be furnished with direct entrance from the sidewalk.\nDoors that open up from the sidewalk shall be recessed to provide a sense of entry to the building.\n(2) The first floor of all principal buildings constructed after the effective date of this section shall\nbe designed to encourage and to complement pedestrian-scale activity by the use of windows and\ndoors. These openings shall be arranged so that the uses contained within the buildings are visible\nand accessible to pedestrians from the public street.\n(3) Windows and building entrances shall comprise at least 50% of the first floor length of any\nprincipal structure. On any ground floor level, any window or door shall be horizontally separated by no\ngreater than 15 feet (eight feet if located in the CB district) from the nearest other such window or door\nin the same fa\u00e7ade level. If the principal structure contains a second or higher story, each such story\nshall contain windows that are spaced in a manner complementary to the second story of nearby\nbuildings.\n(4) In all districts, frames and sashes for windows shall be of wood, vinyl, or pre-finished metal\nand may have stone, brick, or cast concrete lintels and stills. Window glass shall always be set back\nfrom the building face rather than being flush.\n(I) Building articulation. (Applies to all buildings except single- and two-family dwellings) No wall\nthat faces an adjacent public street shall have a blank, uninterrupted length exceeding 30 feet.\n\"Interruptions\" shall include changes in plane by more than one foot, changes in texture or masonry\npatterns or one or more windows, each having a minimum area of ten feet. (see also \"Massing\".)\n(J) Awnings and canopies. (Applies to all buildings except single- and two-family dwellings.) When\nused, lawnings and canopies shall be placed at the top of window openings and shall relate to the\nshape of the top of the window. Awnings shall be made of canvas or treated canvas material, unless\notherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator (or by the Board of Adjustment as part of a conditional\nuse permit approval). Metal lawnings are permitted in the Commercial Corridor Overlay district. When\nbeing installed in the historic district an approval of a certificate of appropriateness from the Historic\nPreservation Commission is required. The style and type of metal lawning shall only be a standing\nseam shed (with or without a valance and with either open or closed ends) with a powder coated or\nbaked-on enamel finish in either a matte or flat earth-tone color, except when in the historic district\ncolors are to be in keeping with approved historic preservation orders. Notwithstanding, vinyl lawnings\nare not permitted. No awning shall extend more than 2/3 the width of the sidewalk or nine feet,\nwhichever is less. Awnings and canopies must be self-supporting from the wall; no supports shall rest\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/232f828e-80b0-45ab-85a9-dbefe4d4773a/download\n114/182\n"}, {"page": "115", "text": "6/26/23, 8:24 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/232f828e-80b0-45ab-85a9-dbefe4d4773a/download\non or interfere with the use of pedestrian walkways or the street. In no case shall any lawning extend\nbeyond the street curb or interfere with street trees or public utilities.\n(K) Building materials. Additions and new construction of all structures (including accessory\nbuildings) shall use facing materials that are compatible in quality, color, texture, finish, and dimension\nto those common in the downtown area. Acceptable materials include brick, stone, wood, cast\nconcrete, or concrete based stucco. Notwithstanding the above, the Zoning Administrator (or the\nBoard of Adjustment in association with the issuance of a conditional use permit) may authorize\nexternal materials other than those listed above where it is judged that such materials are\ncomplimentary to the exterior faades of other nearby buildings located in the CC commercial overlay\ndistrict.\n(L) Building colors. The exterior color finish of all buildings (except for single- and two-family\ndwellings) in the CC commercial overlay district shall compliment the color of buildings that\npredominated in the CC commercial overlay district at the time of adoption of this chapter. In general,\nthose colors should be of low reflectance, subtle or neutral earth tone colors. High intensity colors,\nmetallic colors, black or fluorescent colors shall be prohibited.\n(M) Corporate logo exterior images. Downtown Spencer and areas immediately adjoining it that\ncomprise the CC district contain non-residential uses that primarily are not distinguished by standard\nbuilding colors, building designs or signage that are readily associated with that use's national\ncorporate image or logo. Accordingly, building faades for all new buildings constructed in the CC\ndistrict which are readily identifiable by shape, size, orientation, color or other constructed features\n(irrespective of whether they meet all the other criteria contained in this section) that readily identify\nthat use contained in that building with a national corporate image or logo, shall be prohibited (except\nfor certain signage allowances as contained in \u00a7 155.096.\n(N) Signage. Notwithstanding the standards contained in \u00a7 155.096, the following regulations shall\napply within the CC commercial overlay district:\n(1) No freestanding signs shall be allowed on lots located within the underlying CB district as\nprovided division (2) below.\n(2) Where freestanding signs are allowed, each use shall be allowed to have a maximum of one\nfreestanding sign. Such sign shall have a maximum height of ten feet and a maximum area of 40\nsquare feet. All such signs shall be located outside the street right-of-way. Shopping centers/office\nbuildings and similar multi-tenant developments (outside the CB district) with a gross leasable area of\n50,000+ square feet shall be allowed to have one freestanding sign per public street front, with each\nsign not exceeding 50 square feet.\n(3) Lighting levels for canopies for non-residential uses shall be adequate to facilitate the\nactivities taking place in such locations and not to be used to attract attention to such uses.\n(Ord. 05-05, passed 10-11-05; Am.

The primary\ndate shall be on a weekend, but the second date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date, may be\non a week day.\n(D) If due to topography, existing vegetative canopy, or other local conditions, the Zoning Board of\nAdjustment determines that a tower disguised as a coniferous tree is a preferable aesthetic alternative\nto a simulated lighting tower, it may require such camouflage treatment as a condition of approval.\n(E) It is the policy of the town to encourage co-location and the use of existing structures where\nappropriate. In furtherance of that policy objective, a conditional use permit for a telecommunication\ntower shall not be approved unless the tower is designed structurally, electrically, mechanically in all\nrespects to accommodate at least one additional user. An application shall not be deemed complete\nuntil the applicant submits a letter of intent agreeing to make all of its wireless telecommunication\nfacilities (including existing facilities) within the town available to providers of functionally equivalent\nservices at commercially reasonable rates.

If the applicant or property owner is an entity other than\nan\nindividual, the application shall also include detailed information regarding the principals of the entity.\nThe Town Planner may request additional information needed to determine compliance with this\nchapter, with sufficient copies for necessary referrals and records. No application shall be accepted by\nthe Town Planner unless it complies with the requirements of this chapter.

The\nconditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed\nsupport facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems,\nscreening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements, water\nand sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision of open space and other matters that the\nTown Board may find appropriate. The conditions for approval of the petition may include dedication\nto the town of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer or other public utilities\nnecessary to serve the proposed development. In no case shall the conditions placed upon the\nspecial use permit be less restrictive than the requirements for a general use rezoning.\n(K) The Town Planner shall submit a written analysis of the application including any\nrecommendations based on the finding required by this chapter to the Planning Board within 25\nworking days after he or she accepts the application or within the time consented to in writing by the\napplicant.\n(L) (1) The Planning Board shall review the application and the Town Planner's report and shall\nsubmit to the Town Board a written recommendation based on the findings required in this subchapter.\n(2) The Planning Board shall prepare its recommendations within 45 days of the meeting at which\nthe Town Planner's report is submitted to it or within a further time consented to in writing by the\napplicant or by Town Board resolution.\n(3) If the Planning Board fails to prepare its recommendation to the Town Board within this time\nlimit, or extensions thereof, the Planning Board shall be deemed to recommend approval of the\napplication.\n(4) The Town Planner shall then forward his or her report and the Planning Board's\nrecommendation to the Town Board at the next available Board meeting.\n(M) (1) The Town Planner shall present for consideration by the Town Board, both the petition for\nrezoning and the application for a special use permit. The Board shall consider the rezoning petition\nfirst.\n(2) The Town Board may approve the reclassification of property to a special use district only\nupon determining that the proposed use will meet all standards and requirements in these regulations\nthat are applicable to the proposed use.\n(3) The Town Board shall review the Planning Board's recommendation and the Town Planner's\nreport and at the same public hearing shall act on both the petition for rezoning and the application for\na special use permit based on the findings required in this subchapter.

All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the\nstandards for the approved special use district, the approved petition, and all conditions attached to\nthe special use permit.\n(2) If a special use permit is approved, the Town Planner shall deliver copies of the approved\nspecial use permit and all conditions attached to the Zoning Enforcement Officer in order to facilitate\nthe review of applications for certificates of zoning compliance, building permits and certificates of\noccupancy needed to complete the approved development.\n(3) If a special use permit is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all requirements\nestablished in this chapter for obtaining a certificate of zoning compliance, building permit, and\ncertificate of occupancy. In applying for these forms of development approval, the approved\ndevelopment shall be processed as a \"use permitted under prescribed conditions\" in the approved\nspecial use district.

The Project Review\nCommittee shall forward any application for major changes in detail to the site plan to the Planning\nBoard and the Town Board for their consideration as an amendment to the special use permit or to the\nzoning map.\n(P) It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a special use district only in light of firm plans\nto develop the property. Therefore, from the date of approval of the special use permit, the Zoning\nEnforcement Officer shall periodically examine the progress made toward developing the property in\naccordance with the special use permit and any conditions attached to it. If a building permit has not\nbeen secured within nine months of issuance of the special use permit or if a building permit, once\nsecured, is allowed to expire or is revoked, the special use permit shall be revoked. If a special use\npermit is revoked, the Town Board may choose to reexamine the property to determine whether or not\nthe property should be rezoned.\n(Q) After a certificate of occupancy has been issued for development within a special use district,\nthe Zoning Enforcement Officer shall periodically inspect the use and maintenance of the subject\nproperty to insure continued compliance with these regulations, the approved petition and any\nconditions attached by the Town Board to approval of the petition.\n(R) All the provisions herein are hereby made applicable to the erection, construction, and use of\nbuildings by the state of North Carolina and its political subdivisions.

The Town of Spencer Board of Aldermen recognizes that residential\nproperties exist within the town limits that are vacant, neglected and abandoned. The purpose of this\nregulation is to focus on neglected and abandoned residential properties that will continue to\ndeteriorate into a condition that cannot be repaired if not addressed immediately. These properties are\nvulnerable to break-ins, criminal activity, destruction, fire and other unsafe activities. In addition, they\nattract and/or cause blight to surrounding properties. For these reasons, it is essential to public health,\nsafety and welfare that the town set standards that will not allow a residential property to remain in a\ndeteriorated or dilapidated condition for an extended period of time.\n(B) Broken window theory. That theory states that \"one broken window, left unrepaired, leads to\nmore broken windows as it gives the appearance that no one cares for or protects the property; that\nthe building becomes increasingly more deteriorated, and that the deterioration may have a ripple\neffect on other parts of the neighborhood.\"\n(C) Maintenance and determination.
