It is recognized by the Town\nof Ramseur that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at particular\nlocations in the absence of clearly defined conditions. Such districts may include, but\nshall not be limited to, general use districts, in which a variety of uses are permissible in\naccordance with general standards; overlay districts, in which additional requirements\nare imposed on certain properties within one or more underlying general use districts;\nand conditional zoning districts, in which site plans and individualized development\nconditions are imposed.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the\nowners of all the property to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these\ndistricts may be proposed by the petitioner or the Town or its agencies, but only those\nconditions approved by the board and consented to by the petitioner in writing may be\nincorporated into the zoning regulations or permit requirements. Conditions and site-\nspecific standards imposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address\nthe conformance of the development and use of the site to Town Ordinances and an\nofficially adopted comprehensive plan and those that address the impacts reasonably\nexpected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\nThe procedure for granting Conditional Zoning Districts shall be the same legislative\nprocess required of the Board of Commissioners as outlined in Article XI, Amendments,\nand as authorized by Article 7 in Chapter 160D of the North Carolina General Statutes.\nSection 5.
