In addition to the primary uses which are permitted by right or that may be\npermitted through a conditional zoning, other uses including accessory uses, off-street\nparking and signs are permitted as listed in this Ordinance. The districts are divided into\ntwo different categories: (1) General Zoning Districts; and (2) Overlay Districts. In addition,\nConditional Zoning Districts are addressed in Chapter 19.\nSection 6.2 General Zoning Districts\nGeneral Zoning Districts are designated throughout the planning jurisdiction and include\nnumerous uses that are allowed by right subject to those uses meeting yard and height\nregulations. In addition, each zone allows for conditional uses that may be developed once\nthe Town Board has issued a conditional use permit. The following general zoning districts\nare hereby established.\n6.2.1\nR-1 Residential District\nThis district is established to provide areas consisting primarily of\nsingle-family residences located in both urban and suburban settings. In\nmost cases, public or community water and/or sewer are available.\nThe only principal residential use allowed in this zone is a single-family\nresidence. Minimum lot size will depend on the provision of water and\nsewer facilities. In addition, however, a limited number of public and\nsemi-public uses are allowed. Some of those uses, due to their potential\neffect on residential areas, are only approved as part of a Conditional\nZoning District.\n6.2.2\nR-2 Residential District\nThe R-2 District is also designed to be located in urban and suburban\nsetting where public or community utility facilities may or may not be\npresent. The R-2 District affords a much wider array of housing choices\nfor development. Such uses included planned unit developments. To\nensure that these uses are compatible with the areas for which they are\nproposed, these uses are only approved as part of a Conditional Zoning\nDistrict.\n6-1\n"}, {"page": "72", "text": "6.2.3\nR-3 Residential District\nThis district is designed to accommodate primarily single-family\nresidential areas which were developed prior to the effective date of this\nOrdinance, such areas having density levels substantially greater than\nthose allowed in any other Residential (R) Zoning District in this\nOrdinance. Without the R-3 District, such lots would otherwise\ngenerally be nonconforming, thereby posing a burden to the property\nowner and limiting his ability to expand or replace existing structures.\n6.2.4\nR-4 Residential District\nThis district is intended primarily as a residential district for the location\nof single-family, two-family and multi-family dwellings along with their\ncustomary accessory uses SO as to establish areas where development\npatterns are somewhat more dense than surrounding areas. In order to\nensure that developments are well planned and compatible with\nadjoining residential uses, density levels of developments in excess of\nsix (6) units per acre are only allowed subject to the approval of a\nConditional Zoning District. Any R-4 area SO designated on the Official\nZoning Map shall have access to a public or community water and sewer\nsystem.\n6.2.5\nB-1 Neighborhood Business District\nThis district is designed primarily for local retail business centers\ndesigned to serve relatively small trading areas in developed or\ndeveloping portions of the Cramerton area. As a result, the list of\ncommercial establishments allowed in this district is more limited than\nin other Business (B) zones. The standards designed for these business\nareas are designed to promote sound, permanent business development\nand to protect abutting and surrounding residential areas from\nundesirable aspects of nearby commercial development. Any area SO\nzoned shall be at a location that conveniently serves the trading area\npopulation and does not serve to create or expand problems associated\nwith traffic volumes or circulation. As the district is established to\nprovide for small neighborhood-oriented business areas, limitations on\ngross floor areas are designated.\n6.2.6\nB-2 General Business District\nThe purpose of this district is to provide a wide array of primarily retail\nand personal service uses for use by persons residing in and/or travelling\nthrough the Cramerton area. Such uses shall be located and designed in\nsuch a manner SO as to promote aesthetics, the safe and efficient\nmovement of traffic and to not unduly burden adjoining thoroughfares.\n6-2\n"}, {"page": "73", "text": "Given the large traffic volumes generated by uses located in such a\ndistrict, any area SO zoned shall have access onto an arterial or collector\nhighway.\n6-3\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n6.2.7\nCELL (2, 2): \nB-3 Highway Business District\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nThe B-3 District is similar in nature to the B-2 District in that it is\ndesigned to offer commercial services and opportunities for a large\ntrading area.

A CH\nDistrict may exist along the entire length of a roadway or along any\nidentifiable segment of a roadway. Although such corridor highways\nmay vary in character, particular aspects of development along these\nroads raise common concerns and should be managed in a consistent\nway in order to preserve and enhance the streetscape. Wherever the\nTown Board approves a CH District, it shall consist of all lots fronting\non the corridor highway for a depth as designated by the Town Board.\nAs an overlay, the CH District supplements the standards established\nelsewhere in this Ordinance for development in the underlying zoning\ndistrict.

As these\nthoroughfares will likely serve the bulk of development in the\nCramerton area, at some point in the future creation or widening of these\nroads will take place. In order to minimize any negative impacts to\nadjoining property owners occurring as a result of such improvement\nprojects, the TH district has been created to require that all new\nstructures lying on properties along these roads be adequately set back\nfrom existing road rights-of-way. In this manner when road widening\ndoes occur, it will not be in conflict with development patterns and\nshould eliminate the need to remove any existing structures to\naccommodate the widened road.\n6-5\n"}, {"page": "76", "text": "CHAPTER 7\nZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS\nSection 7.1 Table of Uses\nThe list of uses allowed in each zoning district is indicated in Table 7A.

For instance, customary home occupations are subject\nto the supplemental regulations found in Section 5.1 of this Ordinance. A use that is subject\nto the approval of a Conditional Zoning District is indicated by a \"C\". For instance, an\nabattoir in the B-3 District would be a conditional use and would require the approval of a\nConditional Zoning District. If additional supplemental regulations pertain to a certain\nconditional use, a \"CS\" would indicate this. Such is the case of a nursing home in an O-I\nDistrict.

If a permit is issued for a\ntower that must be higher than 199.9 feet, the provider shall attempt to\nproduce in good faith \"stealth\" antennae locations. This includes antennae\nin a structure or building disguised to look like something else (i.e. steeples,\nbell towers, etc.).\n4.\nIt is the intent of the Town to encourage providers to co-locate\nfacilities in an effort to reduce the number of telecommunication towers in\nthe Town's Planning Jurisdiction. The Town may require providers to\nnegotiate in good faith with other providers space at a reasonable lease\ncost, and to publicize the fact that space is available on a lease basis as\npart of the conditional zoning process. No tower may be located within\n1,500 linear feet of an existing tower unless the applicant can prove that\nco- location is not a viable option.\n5.\nWhere a telecommunication tower is located on a lot with an\nexisting principal use, the tower shall be located in the rear yard only.

It will be the responsibility of the provider to keep all landscaping\nmaterial free from disease and properly maintained in order to fulfill the\npurpose for which it was established. The owners of the property, and any\ntenant on the property where screening is required, shall be jointly and\nseverally responsible for the maintenance of all screen materials. Such\nmaintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the screened area\nfree of litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting\nareas neat in appearance.

The intent of this section shall be to set forth the\nappropriate locations in which adult establishments and sexually oriented\nbusinesses may be established within the Town of Cramerton's planning\njurisdiction and to provide for certain development standards. Such uses,\nbecause of their very nature, are recognized as having serious\nobjectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are\nlocated near eleemosynary, educational, or recreational uses or on high\nvolume traffic arteries. Studies have shown that lower property values and\nincreased crime rates tend to accompany, and are brought about by the\nconcentration of such uses. The Town Board finds that regulation of these\nuses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects do not contribute to\nthe blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to protect the integrity of\nthe Town's schools, churches, day care centers, and recreational facilities\nwhich are typical areas in which juveniles congregate.\n2.\nApplicability. This Section shall apply to all \"Adult\nEstablishments\" as specified and defined in N.C.G.S. 14-202.10 and shall\nalso apply to adult video stores and adult hotels and motels as defined in\nChapter 2.

Adaptive Reuse is only allowed in the R-4 zoning district\nupon approval of a Conditional Zoning District.\nDue to the nature of this conditional use, the dwelling units may, at the discretion\nof the Board of Commissioners, exceed the maximum dwelling units allowed\nwithin the R-4 district, not to exceed a density of forty (40) dwelling units per\nacre.\nThe Town should consider the following criteria when considering approval of a\nConditional Zoning District for adaptive reuse:\n1. The proposed reuse and redeveloped structure will be more suitable and\nappropriate for the lot(s) on which it is located than the existing or former use\nand structure, and the proposed reuse and redeveloped structure will have a\nless harmful effect than the existing or former use and structure on the\nproperties surrounding the lot(s) in question.\n2.

Open Space Dedication.\n1.\nAll residential developments with more than 8 dwelling units or lots shall be\nrequired to dedicate open space. The amount of useable open space required\nfor dedication shall be determined using the Open Space Dedication\n15-33\n"}, {"page": "211", "text": "Matrix. These figures are based upon similar dedication requirements\nthroughout the State of North Carolina with three minor adaptations:\n(a)\nFirst, the matrix was designed to base open space requirements on the\nnumber of bedrooms in a given development rather than the usual\ndedication based upon the dwelling unit. This more accurately reflects\nthe needs of the residents, as the number of bedrooms within a given\ndevelopment is a better representation of the actual number of\nresidents who would use open space.\n(b)\nSecond, the matrix is established to encourage the preservation of land.\nBy allowing for an increase in densities, the matrix provides for an\nincreasing requirement in open space dedication. For example, a 50-\nacre subdivision of 100 lots developed at a density of 2 units per acre\nwould generally require 3.44 acres or 7% of dedicated open space. In\ncontrast, this same tract of land subdivided into 400 lots (or condos) at\na density of 8 units per acre would require 15.15 acres or 30% of\ndedicated open space. These figures are based upon an average of 3\nbedrooms per unit.\n(c)\nThird and final, this matrix has been developed with regard to the\navailability of accessible open space in close proximity to the proposed\ndevelopment. Developments within a 1/2 mile (10 minute) walk (along\nsidewalks or other pedestrian access) to existing publicly dedicated\nopen space (parks, greenbelts, etc.) are granted a reduction in required\nopen space dedication of 25%. Similarly, developments, which are\nadjacent to existing publicly dedicated open space, are granted a 50%\nreduction in required dedication.\n2.\nBecause the open space dedication requirements are based upon preliminary\nestimations of bedroom units in a given development, changing market\nconditions and final build-out of a project may yield a different bedroom\ncount. In order to accommodate for variations, this code will permit\nvariations to the estimated number of bedrooms up to 10%. Variations in\nexcess of 10% may allow a payment in lieu of additional dedication.\nVariation in excess of 25% will require the dedication of additional open\nspace.\n3.\nFor the purposes of good faith estimation, all single family developments\nwill dedicate open space at a rate of 3.5 bedrooms per unit unless otherwise\nstipulated. Attached homes and apartments will dedicate open space at a rate\nof 2-4 bedrooms in accordance with building specifications.\n15-30\n"}, {"page": "212", "text": "How to use this matrix:\n1. Determine average density for proposed development (Gross Dwelling Units per Acre) .\n2. Determine average number of bedrooms per dwelling unit (good faith estimate)\n3. Multiply number of bedrooms by the number of units to get to the estimated number of\nbedrooms.\n4. Multiply the estimated number of bedrooms by figures shown in the matrix, which\nrelate to the density of the site and its proximity to existing open space.\nEXAMPLE\nA developer wants to subdivide a 50-acre tract of land into 120 lots. The average number\nof bedrooms per lot is 3.5 (some 3 bedroom, some 4 bedroom) The tract is not within 1/2\nmile walking distance to any publicly dedicated open space. How much open space is\nrequired for dedication?\nThe density (in dwelling units per acre) is 2.4. There are an estimated 420 bedrooms.\nUsing the multiplier of 520 as shown in the matrix, the required amount of useable open\nspace to be required is 218,400 square feet or 5.01 acres or 10% of the total area.\nd. Payment In Lieu Of Open Space Dedication.\n1.\nThe Town Board, at its discretion and after receiving a recommendation from\nthe Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee, may accept either an equitable\namount of land in another location or a fee paid to the Town in lieu of\ndedication.

Public policy makers, citizens and\ndevelopers all have a stake in understanding and responding to additional demands on the\ntransportation system. A Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is a tool used to evaluate the\nincremental impacts on the surrounding transportation infrastructure and how to mitigate\nthem to maintain safe traffic and transportation operations.\n16.1\nTIA Determination - The Town shall determine the need for a TIA upon receipt of\nany development application (by-right or rezoning) accompanied by a sketch or\nschematic plan. Type 16-s of development applications could include, but are not\nlimited to, multi-family developments, single family developments, commercial\ndevelopments, or annexation requests. If warranted, the transportation consultant\nassigned by the Town shall prepare the TIA. At the discretion of the North Carolina\nDepartment of Transportation (NCDOT) and the Town, a transportation technical\nmemorandum, in lieu of a full TIA report, may be allowed for some developments. If\nproposed street connections are not consistent with adopted plans, then an explanation\nor proposed transportation mitigation alternative that is equal or better shall be\ndiscussed in the study. NCDOT and the Town will be responsible for determining\nwhether the alternative mitigation plan meets and/or exceeds the performance\nstandards of the proposed street connections in the adopted plans.\n16.2\nMinimum Thresholds for TIAs - A TIA will be required to accompany the\ndevelopment plan when expected gross trip generation is 1000 total trips or more both\nentering and exiting the site in a 24-hour period, and/or 100 total trips both entering\nand exiting the site during either the AM or PM peak hours (prior to any trip\nreductions applied - see Section G(10)). The gross trip generation will be calculated\nby the Town based on information (proposed project summary and development plan)\nprovided by the applicant and the final determination for requiring the TIA will be\nmade by the Town. The Town may also determine the need for a TIA or\nTransportation Technical Memorandum based on special circumstances associated\nwith the development, even if the gross trips falls below this threshold. This may be\ndue to location, an intersection or thoroughfare nearby that is at or above capacity, the\nnature of the use, or one of the following:\n1.\nTraffic generated from a non-residential development that could potentially\nsignificantly impact adjacent residential neighborhoods.\n2.\nTraffic operation issues for current and/or future years on nearby streets are\nexpected to be significantly worsened by traffic generated from the\nproposed new development.\n3.\nMajor and minor thoroughfares near the site are experiencing\nsignificant/unacceptable delays.\n16-1\n"}, {"page": "219", "text": "4.\nTraffic safety issues exist at the intersection or street that would serve the\nproposed new development.\n5.\nThe proposed land use differs significantly from the adopted\nComprehensive Land Use Plan for the Town.\n6.\nThe internal street or access system is not anticipated to accommodate the\nexpected traffic generation.\n7.\nThe proposed development project includes a drive-through facility, or other\nuses such as schools that require significant on site circulation that may\nhave an off-site impact to adjoining roads and/or intersections.\n8.\nThe amount, behavior and/or assignment of traffic is significantly different\nfrom a previously approved TIA, or more than 24 months have passed since\ncompletion of previous TIA.\n16.3\nScoping Meeting - A mandatory scoping meeting is required prior to beginning the\nTIA to discuss the requirements and strategies for a TIA specific to the site and the\nproposed development. Background information shall be submitted by the applicant\nfive or more business days prior to the scoping meeting and shall include a conceptual\nsite plan showing proposed access points, proposed land use and densities, structure\nand parking envelopes. The Town, the transportation consultant assigned by the\nTown, and the applicant(s) are required to attend the mandatory scoping meeting, and\nrepresentatives from the NCDOT District office and Gaston-Cleveland-Lincoln\nMetropolitan Planning Organization (GCLMPO) will be invited and encouraged to\nattend as needed. The applicant may invite members of his/her development team as\nneeded.\n16.4\nScoping Document - A Scoping Document, documenting the understood scope and\nparameters of the TIA, shall be prepared by the transportation consultant assigned by\nthe Town. The Scoping Document shall be signed by the applicant, the Town, and the\nNCDOT District Engineer (if access to a state road is involved) before the consultant\ncan begin work on the TIA. Failure by the applicant to provide accurate information\nor failure by the assigned transportation consultant to follow the Scoping Document\nshall result in disapproval of the TIA. If significant changes are made to the\nparameters outlined in the Scoping Document, a revised Scoping Document will be\nrequired.\n16.5\nFees - After the scoping meeting, the transportation consultant assigned by the Town\nshall submit a summary of consultant fees for preparing the TIA to the Town. Per the\nScoping Document, the applicant shall agree to provide payment in full to the Town\nfor preparation of the TIA SO that the Town can release the work to the consultant.\nThe Town may require all or a portion of the estimated fees to be paid to the Town\nprior to commencement of the work.
