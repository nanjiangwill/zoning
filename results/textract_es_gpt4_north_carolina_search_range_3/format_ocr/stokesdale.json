Box 2235 Tallahassee, FL 32316\nPREFACE\nThis Code is a codification of the ordinances of the Town of Stokesdale, North Carolina, of a general and permanent nature.\nSource materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the Town through October 23, 2016. The source of each section is\nincluded in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the\nfirst time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section included\nherein.\nThe chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to\nfacilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state\nlaw citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume.\nNumbering System\nThe numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component\nparts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section\nwithin the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 4 is numbered 4-1 and the third section of Chapter 1 is 1-3. Under this system, each section is identified\nwith its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for\namendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added,\nsuch new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be\nincluded between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained\nwhen including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the\nchapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being\nassigned to the article or division.\nIndex\nThe index of the code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings\nbeing couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are\nnumerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.\nLooseleaf Supplements\nA special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the\nCode. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the\nappropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of\ninserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.\nThe successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will\nthen become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the\npublishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed\nfor historical reference purposes.\nAcknowledgments\nThe publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Austin Bates, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit\nis gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\n1 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\n"}, {"page": "2", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nThe publishers are most grateful to Kim Hemric, Town Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code.

Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall\napply:\n(A) Centerline. Where a boundary line lies within and follows a street or alley right-of-way, a railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary\nshall be construed to be in the center of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street or alley right-\nof-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from\ndedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.\n(B) Edge line. Where a boundary line follows the edge of a street or alley right-of-way, a railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall\nbe construed to be in the edge of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street or alley right-of-way,\nrailroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from\ndedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the edge of the abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.\n(C) Lot line. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. In the event that a district\nboundary line divides a lot or tract, each part of the lot or tract so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this\nOrdinance for the district in which said part is located.\n(D) City limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits or extraterritorial boundary lines shall be construed as following the city\nlimits or extraterritorial boundary lines.\n(E) County line. Boundaries indicated as approximately following county lines shall be construed as following the county line.\n(F) Watercourses. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be\nconstrued to follow such center lines.\n(G) Extensions. Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or as extensions of street or alley rights-of-way, channelized waterways, railroad rights-of-way,\nutility easements, lot lines, city limits, county lines, or extraterritorial boundaries, shall be so construed.\n(H) Scaling. Where a district boundary does not coincide with any boundary lines as above and no distances are described by specific ordinance, the\nboundary shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map. In the case of flood zones, corps of engineers work maps, if\navailable, shall be used for scaling.\n(I) Watersheds. Outer boundaries of general watershed area districts indicated as approximately following ridge lines or streets shall be construed\nto follow ridge lines (the actual drainage basin boundaries). Watershed critical area district outer boundaries not forming the inner boundaries of\ngeneral watershed area districts shall be construed in the same manner. Boundaries between general watershed area districts and watershed\ncritical area districts indicated as approximately following major landmarks (identifiable major features) such as streets shall be construed to\nfollow the centerlines of such features or, where applicable, the projections of the centerlines of such features.\n1-12.2 Interpretation by board of adjustment. Where existing natural or man-made features on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official\nzoning map, or are not covered by section 1-12.1 (Boundary Interpretation), the board of adjustment shall interpret the district boundary.\n(Ord. of 4-9-2007(1))\nSec. 1-13.

For all WCA and GWA areas, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of units allowed for single\nfamily detached developments under the low density option as listed in Table 2-1-1.\n2) Cluster required. The planning board or town council may require that cluster development be used if right-of-way dedication is required\npursuant to N.C.G.S. 136-66.10 or the development lies partially or wholly within a watershed critical area.\n3) Development standards. The objective of the cluster option is to place the houses in a development closer together and on smaller lots than\nwould normally be permitted by the zoning district in which the development is located, and to place land which would otherwise have been\nincluded in private lots into public dedication or common area.\na) When cluster development is employed, all lot size and other dimensional requirements for single-family dwellings are decreased to\ncomply with all requirements of a smaller-lot RS zone.\nb) The sum of those areas placed into common area as open space, those areas dedicated as public open space in excess of any required\ndedication for such purposes, and those areas dedicated as street right-of-way pursuant to N.C.G.S. 136-66.10(a) shall not be less than 15\npercent of the total area of the development.\nc) The maximum number of lots shall be determined as follows:\ni) Calculate the gross acreage of the tract, excluding any existing street right-of-way;\nii) Subtract three-fourths of the area of any drainageway and/or open space required to be dedicated by this Ordinance.\niii) Multiply by the density factor from Table 4-4-2.\n81 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 4-4-2 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT LOT AND DENSITY\nREQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE FAMILY DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 4-4-2 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT LOT AND DENSITY\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \nDEVELOPMENT ZONED\nCELL (2, 2): \nLOTS AND BUILDINGS\nMUST MEET\nREQUIREMENTS OF\nCELL (2, 3): \nDENSITY FACTOR\nPER ACRE\nCELL (3, 1): \nRS-40 (WCA Tier 2)\nCELL (3, 2): \nRS-40\nCELL (3, 3): \n0.20\nCELL (4, 1): \nRS-40 (WCA Tier 3)\nCELL (4, 2): \nRS-40\nCELL (4, 3): \n0.33\n"}, {"page": "82", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nd) Common areas shall be located within the development to:\ni) Preserve stands of trees, lakes, steep slopes, historic sites or other significant features;\nii) Provide common green space in the development for aesthetic purposes and pedestrian use;\niii) Provide space for common recreation facilities and meeting places; or\niv) Provide buffering from adjacent land uses of higher intensity.\nv) Minimize stormwater flow and runoff impacts to receiving waters in WCA and GWA areas.\ne) Common area for open space shall be of usable dimensions, including a minimum width of 24 feet and shall be accessible to all\nhomeowners in the development.\nf) If approved by the governing body, a site may be reserved for a school, church, civic club, public recreation center or public library within\nthe area that would otherwise have been common area\nSOO\nCONVENTIONAL SINGLE FAMILY\nCLUSTER DEVELOPMENT SINGLE FAMILY\nDETACHED SUBDIVISION\nDETACHED SUBDIVISION\nAcres\nAcres\n15 Lots\nLots\n- 12,000 S.F.

All other\ndimensional requirements of this Ordinance shall apply.\"\n(D) Open channel on private property within drainage maintenance and utility easement.\n1) This section applies to open channels on private property within a drainage maintenance and utility easement. This method shall not be\nutilized in any subdivision intended for single-family detached dwellings unless the governing body, determines that an open channel would\nnot become a missing segment in a system of stormwater piping and that the open channel is well removed from all anticipated building\nlocations.\n2) The drainage maintenance and utility easement shall include the required drainage channel and the land between the channel and the\nnatural 100-year flood contour as determined by FEMA or by calculations approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; or, in some cases, it\nmay be reduced by modifying the drainage maintenance and utility easement topography to a typical required drainage channel section as\nprovided for in this section. However, the minimum total width of a drainage maintenance and utility easement shall be no less than\nspecified below.\nThe drainage maintenance and utility easement width shall be centered on the typical required drainage channel section, unless the\ngoverning body approves other drainage maintenance and utility easement alignments because of topographic conditions.\n3)\nIn case of severe topography, additional width may be required to assure reasonable ease of maintenance.\n4) The drainage maintenance and utility easement topography may be modified if permitted under section 7-4 (Soil erosion and sedimentation\ncontrol). In such cases, the approved typical required drainage channel section shall include the necessary channel to accommodate a 100-\nyear flood. The area outside of the required drainage channel may be filled; but any resulting slope shall be no steeper than two to one,\nunless the slope is protected by masonry paving, rip-rap, or other material which meet the jurisdictions specifications.\n5) If the governing body determines suitable access to the drainage maintenance and utility easement is not otherwise provided, access shall\nbe guaranteed by a suitably located access easement which shall be no less than 20 feet in width.\n6) It shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain provide all streams located on their property. If the governing body determines that it\nis in the public interest to alter the typical required channel section and/or profile of the stream to improve flow, the jurisdiction may enter\nthe property within the indicated access or drainage maintenance and utility easement and carry out the necessary work without liability for\nany damage to the property, or improvements thereon, located within the easement.\n7) Drainage maintenance and utility easements may be utilized for any underground utility provided that:\n111 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCubic Feet per Second in 100-year Storm\nCELL (1, 2): \nRequired Distance form Stream Centerline\nCELL (2, 1): \n5 - 17 cfs\nCELL (2, 2): \n15 ft.\nCELL (3, 1): \n17 - 70 cfs\nCELL (3, 2): \n30 ft.\nCELL (4, 1): \n70 or more cfs\nCELL (4, 2): \n50 ft. plus 1/2 channel width\nCELL (5, 1): \ncfs = Cubic Feet Per Second\nCELL (5, 2): \n"}, {"page": "112", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\na) Underground utility lines to be installed by any utility provider other than the jurisdiction shall be subject to approval by the enforcement\nofficer.\nb) The government agency or private company installing underground lines after development has been completed by the owner of the\nproperty shall be responsible for the replacement of all fencing, pavement and grassed areas disturbed by such installation.\nc) The jurisdiction shall not be responsible for damage caused by the installation of additional lines by any private utility company.\nd) The jurisdiction shall not be liable for damages to any improvements located within the drainage maintenance and utility easement area\ncaused by maintenance of utilities located therein.\n8) No buildings or structures except for water related improvements shall be placed or constructed within the access or drainage maintenance\nand utility easement.

When the increase in the velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause\naccelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to\nminimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.\n7-4.3 Mandatory standards for land-disturbing activity. No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this Ordinance shall be undertaken except in\naccordance with the following mandatory standards:\n(A) Buffer zone. No land-disturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along\nthe margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25 percent of the buffer zone nearer the land-disturbing\nactivity, provided, that this subsection (A) shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located\non, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse. Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone is measured from the edge of the water\nto the nearest edge of the disturbed area, with the 25 percent of the strip nearer the land disturbing activity containing natural or artificial\nmeans of confining visible siltation;\n(B) Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no steeper than two to one slope if they are to be stabilized with vegetative\ncover. Slopes or fills steeper than two to one slope must be protected by structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within 30 days of\ncompletion of any phase of grading, be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion;\n(C) Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one acre is uncovered,\nthe person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to\nretain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of\nsaid tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or\ndevelopment. Except as provided in section 7-4.4(B)5), provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within\n30 working days or 120 calendar days following completion, whichever period is shorter; and\n(D) Prior plan approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity on a tract more than one acre is to be uncovered unless, 30 or more days\nprior to initiating the activity, an erosion and sedimentation control plan for such activity is filed with and approved by the jurisdiction.\n7-4.4 Design and performance standards.\n(A) Design for ten-year storm. Except as provided in subsection (B)2), soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall\nbe so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm.\nRunoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for\nConservation Practices,\" or other acceptable calculation procedures.\n(B) High quality water zones. In high quality water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply:\n1) Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area within the boundaries of the tract to 20 acres. Only the\nportion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this subsection. Larger areas may be uncovered within the\nboundaries of the tract with the written approval of the director (DEHNR).\n2) Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices within HQW zones shall be so planned, designed and constructed\nto provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to\nprocedures in the United States Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation\nPractices\" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized\norganization or association.\n3) Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a settling efficiency of at least 70 percent\nfor the 40 micron size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of that two-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of\nrunoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service's \"National\nEngineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United\nStates or any generally reorganized organization or association.\n4) Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one\nvertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using\nmechanical devices, structural devices, or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain\naccelerated erosion.\n5) Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land-disturbing activity in a HQW zone within 15 working\ndays or 60 calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever period is shorter.\n7-4.5 Storm water outlet protection.\n(A) Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated\nerosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-disturbing activity.\n(B) Performance standard. Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post-construction velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the\nreceiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:\n184 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\n"}, {"page": "185", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n1) The velocity established by Table 7-4-1; or\n2) The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development.\nIf conditions 1) or 2) above cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed and\nconstructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds the \"prior to development\" velocity by ten percent.\nSource - Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for\nchannels with straight alignment.

The board shall:\n1) Fix a reasonable time for holding a public hearing on the variance request;\n2) Give notice of the variance request as prescribed in section 9-1.2 (Notice); and\n3) Decide the variance request within a reasonable time.\n(C) Grounds for variance.\n1) The board shall make findings of fact that the requirements of subsection (D) have been met by the applicant.\n2) The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. The fact that\nproperty may be utilized for greater profit, however, will not be considered adequate to justify the granting of a variance.\n3)\nThe board shall not, under any circumstances, grant a variance to permit a use or densify not otherwise permitted by this Ordinance in the\nzoning district involved.\n4) Neither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district, nor the permitted use of lands, buildings or\nstructures in other zoning districts shall be considered as grounds for the issuance of a variance. Furthermore, mere financial hardship does\nnot constitute grounds for the granting of a variance.\n5) A variance may be granted where a building permit has been issued and, due to unintentional error of the enforcement officer in\ndetermining the location of the structure on the property, there is a minimal violation of the dimensional requirements, provided that such\nrelief may be granted without substantially impairing the purpose and intent of this Ordinance.\n(D) Granting of variance. A variance may be granted by the board if evidence presented by the applicant persuades it to reach the following\nconclusions:\n1) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence\nof the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\n2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size or topography. Hardships resulting from\npersonal circumstances as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not\nbe the basis for granting a variance.\n3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n4) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial\njustice is achieved.\n(E) Conditions. In granting a variance, the board may prescribe such reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards as will assure that the\nuse of the property to which the variance applies will be compatible with surrounding properties and will not alter the essential character of the\nneighborhood.\n1) Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of\nthis Ordinance.\n2) A variance granted subject to a condition shall be permitted only so long as there is compliance with the condition,\n3) If a violation of a condition of a variance occurs, the enforcement officer may revoke the certificate of occupancy.\n4) In the event that any such condition is held invalid, for any reason, such holding shall have the effect of invalidating the variance granted and\nshall render the variance null and void,\n(F) Duration. The variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only. Unless otherwise specified, construction or\noperation shall be commenced within 12 months of the date of issuance of a variance, or the variance shall become void.\n9-4.9 Flood hazard appeals.\n(A) Authority.

The Guilford County Planning Department is the only agency with the authority to assign or modify street addresses within its Jurisdiction.\nA-2 STREET ADDRESS SYSTEM\nA-2-1 Establishment of Grid System\n(A) From Greensboro. Elm Street and Market Street are the base lines used in numbering a street in a north/south or east/west direction. Streets\nrunning north and south from Market Street shall be numbered starting with the 100 block. Streets running least and west from Elm Street shall\nbe numbered starting with the 100 block.\n(B) From High Point. Main Street and the Southern Railroad tracks are the base lines used in numbering a street in a north/south or east/west\ndirection. Streets running north and south from the Southern Railroad tracks shall be numbered starting with the 100 block. Streets running least\nand west from Main Street shall be numbered starting with the 100 block.\nA-2-2 Odd-Even Numbers.\n(A) From Greensboro. Going north and south from Elm Street and east and west from Market Street, EVEN addresses will be on the right hand side\nof the street while ODD addresses will be on the left hand side of the street.\n(B) From High Point. Going north and south from Main Street and east and west from the Southern Railroad tracks, EVEN addresses will be on the\nright hand side of the street while ODD addresses will be on the left hand side of the street.\nA-2-3 Vacant Properties.\nBecause there is no way of determining how many structures will eventually be built on vacant land within a block, any system which attempts to\nnumber structures consecutively does not provide the flexibility to accommodate change. A street number is assigned for each 100 feet of lot\nfrontage.\nA-2-4 Corner Lot.\n206 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\n"}, {"page": "207", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nCorner lots are assigned two numbers since the unit could face either street. The owner or developer shall be assigned the street address that\naccommodates the front entrance of the structure, at the time of permit application.\nA-2-5 Street Address Assignment.\n(A) Primary Address. Each unit of property will be assigned a primary address. Primary addresses will consist of up to four numerals, and will be\ndetermined by the block in which the property is located. The determination of block length will be by each municipality. Single family structures\n(attached or detached) and townhouses are assigned individual street numbers for each unit.\n(B) Secondary Address.\n1) Multi-family Dwellings. Apartment, twin homes, duplexes, and condominiums are assigned secondary addresses. The secondary address will\ninclude the primary address followed by a dash and a number and/or letter. An example would be \"1621-A Smith Street\" with \"1621\" being\nthe primary address and \"A\" being the secondary address. The first unit on the first floor would be addresses \"1621-1A Smith Street; the\nsecond flood \"1621-2A Smith Street\"; etc.\n2) Nonresidential Buildings. Office, commercial and industrial buildings with more than one tenant are also assigned secondary addresses. The\ndesignation of the address will be according to the individual jurisdiction only when sufficient numbers are not available or common exterior\ndrives are used. The secondary address will include the primary address followed by a suite number. The first unit on the first floor would be\naddressed \"1621 Smith Street, Suite 101\", the second floor \"1621 Smith Street, Suite 201,\" etc.\n(C) Timing, Addresses are assigned following preliminary plat or site plan approval for single family attached or cluster developments, townhouses\nand condominiums and nonresidential group development. Approval of a final plat is required for conventional single family developments\nbefore numbers are assigned and building permits issued. The Enforcement Officer is furnished with an approved plat or site plan on which to\nassign addresses. The plat or site plan will be kept on file in the Planning Department.\nA-3 POSTING OF ADDRESSES\nPosting of addresses by the property owner shall be as per Guilford County Street Address Ordinance adopted April 16, 1984. Only digits to be used\nin the number as opposed to script.\nA-4 CHANGE OF EXISTING ADDRESS\nIn assigning new addresses, as few existing addresses as possible will be changed.\nA-4-1 Reason for Change\nExisting addresses may be changed for just cause. Examples of just cause are:\n(A) Area where no addresses were left for vacant lot(s).\n(B) Street name change approved by Planning Board.\n(C) Person unknowingly using the wrong address.\n(D) Change from rural route and box number to urban street address number.\n(E) Street address number series presently in use is incorrect and misleading\nA-4-2 Notification\nThe Planning Department will notify all necessary local government departments, utility service companies and the U.S. Postal Service of any new\nassignment or change in street address.\nA-5 ALPHABET NOT USED\nThe letters \"I\" and \"O\" will not be used in street addresses.\nA-6 STREET NAMES\nThe developer shall submit names for new streets contained within proposed developments. The Planning Department shall approve all street\nnames with right of appeal to the Town Council. Proposed streets obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be given the same name. In no\nother case shall the name of proposed streets duplicate existing street names.. The proposed name shall not be phonetically similar to existing\nnames irrespective of suffix.\nA-7 STREET NAME PREFIX AND SUFFIX\nA-7-1 Prefixes\n(A) The prefix \"North\" shall be used for the northern portion of roadways having the same name. (According to each users grid system.)\n(B) The prefix \"South\" shall be used for the southern portion of roadways having the same name.

The Comprehensive Plan is general and far-\nreaching in nature. With a planning horizon of approximately 20 years, the Plan serves as a guide for future growth and development. The County\nComprehensive Plan consists of the following elements: environmental constraints, transportation systems, public utilities, community facilities, open\nspace and recreation, and existing and future land use. These elements were analyzed and goals were established in the development of the\nCountywide Plan.\nIncluded in the Comprehensive Plan are policy statements designed tohelpimplement thePlan'sgoals.One such policystatement directs the\nPlanning staff to undertake detailed area plans for unincorporated communities. Since the adoption of the County Comprehensive Plan in 1986,\nStokesdale was incorporated. In 1998, the Stokesdale Town Council adopted the Northwest Area Plan, and began to implement and enforce a town\nDevelopment Ordinance, through a contract with the Guilford County Planning & Development Department. With the incorporation of Stokesdale and\nthe adoption of the Northwest Area Plan, it became imperative that the town adopts a land use plan that is specifically tailored to local issues and\nconcerns. In keeping with this, the Town Council appointed a Land Use Plan Committee to develop the Stokesdale Future Land Use Plan.\nINTRODUCTION\nLocation & Geography\nStokesdale is located in the rolling upland of Northwest Guilford County, North Carolina. It encompasses approximately 12,000 acres (21 square miles)\nmost of which is agricultural and low density residential in character. The majority of the developed land is located along U.S. Highway 158, Highway\n68 and in the town center. There are numerous small streams that have created a generally rolling topography that increases as one travels from east\nto west, with the most significant topography in the southwestern corner of town.\nThe town limits follow the Guilford County portion of the Stokesdale Fire District. This area is bounded by Rockingham County to the north, U.S. 220 to\nthe east, the Haw River to the south, and Forsyth County to the west. (See map below)\n222 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\n"}, {"page": "223", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nROCKINGHAM COUNTY\nBELEWS CREEK PD\nSTOKESDALE\nStokesdale Town Boundaries\nThree major highways intersect the town: U.S. Highway 158, Highway 68, and N.C. Highway 65. Part of the town borders a fourth major highway, U.S.\nHighway 220 (future 1-73). With this network of roads, Stokesdale citizens are within a short drive of Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem, and\nReidsville.\nHistorically, the center of town was the railroad depot (site of the current Stokesdale fire station), located on Main Street in the Central Business\nDistrict (CBD), which runs parallel to N.C. 158 between N.C. 68 and N.C. 65. The historic town center includes a mix of late nineteenth-century\ncommercial and residential structures, post WW II neighborhoods, and more recently built commercial buildings at the major intersections. The land\njust north of the CBD is relatively flat, while the land just south of the CBD becomes rugged as it leads down to the King's Creek floodplain.\nUnited States Highway 158 is an important thoroughfare running through Stokesdale. This road carries a significant amount of traffic from U.S. 220,\non the eastern edge of town, to High Point and Winston-Salem to the south and west of Stokesdale. Toward the eastern edge of town, U.S. 158 has a\nconcentration of industrial development, including Culp Ticking, Burlington Industries, and Vulcan Materials Quarry. North Carolina Highway 68 is the\nmain north-south thoroughfare through the town. A significant portion of this route has been developed with new residential neighborhoods (see\nExisting Land Use Map).\nThe northwestern portion of Guilford County, including Stokesdale, has become a popular place to live. This is evidenced by the number of new\nresidential developments occurring within the town. Population figures for Stokesdale between 1990 and 2000 reveal an increase of fifty-three\npercent (53%) from 2,134 to 3,267 residents. This is significant when compared to the twenty-one percent (21%) increase for all of Guilford County in\nthe same decade. Due to the popularity of Northwest Guilford County, the population of Stokesdale is expected to continue increasing at a more\nrapid rate than the county as a whole.\nTown History\nStokesdale was originally settled as the community of \"Green Pond\" or later \"Pond\" named for a swampy pond located near the present day\nintersection of Ellisboro Road and N.C. Highway 65. In 1865, a post office opened in the local general store to serve the rural community. The Cape\nFear and Yadkin Railroad was built through the community in 1886. As with many transportation projects, the opening of the train depot in Stokesdale\nencouraged residential settlement in the community and industrial development near the rail line. It was also at this time that the name was changed\nfrom \"Pond\" to Stokesdale. The name was in honor of a man named Stokes, who was either an executive of the railroad, a conductor on the train, or\nthe surveyor who surveyed the area for the railroad, depending on who you ask.\nThe town first incorporated in 1907. The Town went bankrupt during the Great Depression and became inactive in the 1930's. The State revoked its\ncharter in 1971. The town was re-incorporated on November 9, 1989.\nLAND USE PLAN REQUEST\nStokesdale is poised for growth in the 21st Century. Once an isolated farming community, it is now located at the intersection of several major\nhighways that provide easy access to the growing cities of the Piedmont Triad. The town has secured funding for a public water supply system. This,\nalong with its scenic beauty, good schools, and high quality of life, will promote continued residential and commercial growth in the community.\n223 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nFire Station\nMcCRORY R\nRecreation\nFacility\nDowntown Stokesdale\nCELL (1, 2): \nBELEWS CREEK RD\nTown\nHall\nNC 158 (Main\nStreet)\nStokesdale\nElementary\nSchool\n"}, {"page": "224", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nWith this understanding, the Stokesdale Town Council appointed a Land Use Plan Committee, with technical assistance provided by county staff to\nundertake the task of creating a land use plan for the town.\nA Land Use Plan is defined as \"A plan showing the existing and proposed location, extent and intensity of development of land to be used in the\nfuture for varying types of residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, educational, and other public and private purposes or\ncombination of purposes.\" (The Illustrated Book of Development Definitions, p. 115)\nA land use plan is a method for the town to accommodate future growth of the community. It provides the community a \"roadmap\" to guide growth\nso that it occurs in a rational, predictable manner, to best suit the needs of current and future citizens. The plan consists of the following elements:\nexisting land use, environmental constraints, transportation systems, historic preservation, public utilities, community facilities, open space and\nrecreation, and future land use. Specific goals were created from these elements that have been \"voiced\" in the Vision Statement.\nPlan Study Committee Appointment\nThe Stokesdale Town Council adopted the Guilford County Northwest Area Plan in April 1998 as a land use-planning tool. The Northwest Area Plan\nstudied the entire northwest area of the county, including the areas now incorporated as the Towns of Stokesdale, Summerfield, and Oak Ridge, along\nwith the Colfax community. Town Council requested a more specific plan be developed to aid in land use decisions for their town, one tailored to the\nspecific interests, opportunities, and constraints of their community.\nThe Council sent informational newsletters to citizens in Stokesdale requesting those interested to become members of the Land Use Committee.\nFollowing this, several informational meetings were held to explain the land use planning process and to solicit potential committee members.\nIn February 1999, the Stokesdale Town Council reviewed the applications of citizens that requested to serve on the Land Use Planning Committee.\nSubsequently, eleven applicants were appointed. Three of the members serve on the Stokesdale Planning Board, and three members previously\nserved on the Northwest Area Plan Steering Committee. The other members are a cross-section of the community, including small business owners,\nlong-time residents, new residents, commercial and residential developers, and a University of North Carolina, Greensboro professor.\nThe following citizens served on the Long-Range Planning Committee:\nGuilford County Planning & Development staff by provided technical assistance in developing the Land Use Plan. Les Eger, AICP, Senior Planner, and\nMichael Brandt, AICP, Planner, served as lead staff. Curtis Short, GIS Mapping Technician, provided invaluable support in developing the various maps\nand statistics used in the development of the plan.\nSpecial Acknowledgements\nThe Committee and staff would like to thank all of the people who gave-up their evenings to volunteer their services in educating the Committee on\nthe various subjects and issues discussed by the group. Without their knowledge and commitment to the community, this plan would not have been\npossible.\nThe Committee would also like to say a special thank you to Carolyn Joyner, Stokesdale Town Clerk, for all of her work for the Committee, especially\nfor publishing the Draft Land Use Plan and maps on the Official Stokesdale webpage: http://hb.thedepot.com/Stokesdale.\nPlan Development Process\nOver the past 18 months, the Committee and staff met regularly to learn about and discuss a variety of issues and topics important to the town. Staff\ncontacted individuals and organizations to provide experts in the many different areas that the committee studied. These issues and presentations\nincluded:\n224 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nMr. Fred Berry, Co-Chairman\nCELL (1, 2): \nMr. Frank Lato, Co-Chairman\nCELL (2, 1): \nMr. Randy Braswell\nCELL (2, 2): \nMr. John Flynt\nCELL (3, 1): \nMrs. Mickie Holbrook\nCELL (3, 2): \nMr. Tony Hommel\nCELL (4, 1): \nMr. Scott Lawrence\nCELL (4, 2): \nMr. Richard Millard\nCELL (5, 1): \nMr. Jerry Shields\nCELL (5, 2): \nMr. Anthony Vaughn\nCELL (6, 1): \nMr. Robert Wurz\nCELL (6, 2): \n"}, {"page": "225", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nHighlights of the Northwest Area Plan: This included a visual presentation and a discussion of various elements critical to the implementation of the\nplan.\nTransportation: Staff from the Greensboro Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), the transportation planning area that includes Stokesdale, and\nthe North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) provided expert discussion of transportation issues in the community. This included\n\"traffic calming\" to slow traffic in the town center, the suitability of a U.S. 158 by-pass, and interconnectivity of local roads for safety and lease of\nmovement.\nGroundwater and Septic Systems: Members of the North Carolina Department of Environment & Natural Resources (NCDENR) and the Guilford\nCounty Health Department presented information on individual and community septic systems, community water systems and contaminated well\nmitigation efforts. The town held a public meeting to discuss the ground water contamination found near the Southern Meadows neighborhood and\nthe Culp Ticking site (US 158 east, near Athens Road). Staff also presented information on watershed protection requirements for the Reidsville and\nDan River watersheds.\nRecreation and Open Space: The Piedmont Land Conservancy, a local non-profit Land Trust, led a discussion on protecting environmental resources\nand farmland in Stokesdale through conservation easements and public dedication efforts. County staff continued the discussion to include shared\nrecreational facilities with the Guilford County School District and creating a trail network for pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian use.\nHistoric Sites: Staff from the Guilford County Historic Preservation Commission discussed the numerous historic properties located throughout the\ntown, especially the large number of commercial and residential structures within the town core. The North Carolina Department of Community\nAffairs presented a session on \"Main Street\" economic development programs that could help to capitalize on the historic nature of downtown\nStokesdale.\nSchools: The Committee met with staff members of the Guilford County Public School District to discuss needs and issues affecting public school\nconstruction and facilities in Stokesdale and the Northwest area.\nAt the end of the educational process, a \"visioning workshop\" was held by the Committee to create the basic principles and guidelines that future\ndevelopment should follow in Stokesdale. From this effort, the future land use map and plan were developed.\nPublic Participation\nAfter the Committee completed a draft Plan, the public was invited to attend two informal meetings held in June 2000. Approximately 30 citizens\nattended these meetings and most of their comments were positive; however, there was significant discussion regarding the Town Core Area and\nother issues. The Committee reviewed these comments and responded by making significant changes to the Plan. In addition, there were public\ncomment opportunities during committee presentations of the Plan to the Planning Board and the Town Council during the summer and fall of 2000.\nIt is hoped that the plan is reflective of the very thoughtful efforts and recommendations of the many people who have dedicated their time and effort\nto the Town of Stokesdale.\nPLAN ELEMENTS\nLand Use Plans are comprised of a number of specific elements, or sections, that provide the basic building blocks for a future land use plan. These\nelements include existing land use, community facilities, historic structures, environment, and transportation.\nExisting Land Use\nStokesdale is a predominantly rural community. There is a historic central downtown, recently built low-density residential neighborhoods scattered\nthroughout, and industrial areas located mostly in the eastern area of town. The following tables provide a detailed breakdown of the different\nexisting land uses and comparable zoning district classifications, by number of acres and percentage of total area (see Existing Land Use Map):\n225 of 241\n10/25/2023, AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nLand Use\nCELL (1, 2): \nArea (Acres)\nCELL (1, 3): \nPercent\nCELL (2, 1): \nAgricultural/Vacant\nCELL (2, 2): \n9,609\nCELL (2, 3): \n76.72%\nCELL (3, 1): \nCommercial\nCELL (3, 2): \n39.5\nCELL (3, 3): \n0.32%\nCELL (4, 1): \nOffice\nCELL (4, 2): \n11.7\nCELL (4, 3): \n0.09%\nCELL (5, 1): \nIndustrial\nCELL (5, 2): \n335\nCELL (5, 3): \n2.67%\nCELL (6, 1): \nPublic/Institutional\nCELL (6, 2): \n329.6\nCELL (6, 3): \n2.63%\nCELL (7, 1): \nResidential\nCELL (7, 2): \n1,510.6\nCELL (7, 3): \n12.06%\n"}, {"page": "226", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n*Note: LCID Landfills, and the buffer area around LNG Facility\nData compiled by Staff March 2000\n*Note: This includes the Retirement Community\nData provided by Guilford County Planning & Development GIS Section August 2000\nAgricultural/Vacant\nThe predominant land use within Stokesdale is in the agriculture/vacant category. This is clear by reviewing both the existing land use and current\nzoning designations. Over 75% of the land is classified as agricultural/vacant or zoned agricultural. The Pine Needles Liquid Natural Gas facility, which\nis located in south central Stokesdale, has a significant buffer area, which must remain undeveloped to protect the community in case of a\ncatastrophic emergency. The buffer area makes up approximately 4% of the land area of the town and must remain in permanent open space.\nCommercial/Office\nThe majority of land being used for commercial development is located in and around the Town Core area. This includes the intersections of U.S. 158\nand N.C. 68, U.S. 158 and N.C. 65, and along Main Street (US 158). There is a scattering of commercial development along U.S. 158 east of Downtown\nStokesdale, interspersed among industrial developments. Less than 1% of the total land area is being used for commercial development. Commercial\ndevelopment has not seen the surge in growth that residential development has experienced.\nIndustrial\nStokesdale has approximately 2.5% of its land area being used or zoned for industrial development. These areas are located along U.S. 158 in the\neastern portion of town with large companies such as Culp Ticking, Vulcan Materials Quarry, APAC Carolina and RMC Carolina. The Four Seasons\nApparel site, which is located in the Town Core along Ellisboro Street, is zoned for industrial use, but is currently vacant.

The majority of this is low-density, single-family residents. One exception is\nthe Countryside Village Retirement Community located on U.S. 158. The majority of the residentially used and zoned property is located along the N.C.\n68 corridor, in the Town Core Area, and along Athens Road and Southard Road.\nExcept in the town core, homes are on large lots that cover an acre or more. This is because there is no public sewer service available and significant\narea must be available for septic drain fields on each lot. New technology may allow some developments to be more compact in the future. It is likely,\nhowever, that single homes on large lots will continue to be the norm.\nCommunity Facilities\nSchools\nChildren in Stokesdale attend a number of public and private schools in the Northwest part of the county. Stokesdale Elementary located in the\nsoutheast corner of the U.S. 158 and N.C. 68 intersection is the only public school located within the corporate limits of Stokesdale. Students attend\nNorthwest Middle and Northwest High School for their secondary education, located in unincorporated Guilford County.\nThere are no private schools located within Stokesdale; however, there are a number of private schools located in the Northwest and in Greensboro\nthat children in Stokesdale attend. It is unknown how many children attend these schools.\nThere are also a number of small day care centers that provide services for working families with young children.\nPublic Safety\nThe Stokesdale Fire Department is a volunteer company of 30+ volunteers operating out of a new fire station located in downtown Stokesdale across\nfrom Town Hall. This station serves not only incorporated Stokesdale, but also the Stokesdale Fire District, which includes areas in, and Rockingham\nCounties.\nGuilford County Sheriff's Department provides police protection to the town through an intergovernmental agreement. This includes a full-time\ndeputy assigned to Stokesdale. Within the past year, the town has purchased a radar gun to facilitate traffic enforcement.\nStokesdale and the American Red Cross have established an emergency shelter for the community. The shelter is located at the Stokesdale United\nMethodist in the Central Business District. When needed, local Red Cross volunteers operate the emergency shelter.\nPlaces of Worship\nArea churches include denominations of Baptist, United Methodist, and Disciples of Christ as well as other denominations and faiths both within\nStokesdale and beyond the borders of the town that serve the needs of the community through a variety of services and clubs.\nRecreation\nOne Community Park, two walking tracks, and the school grounds that are used for recreation serve the town. The Community Park is located on 20\nacres of land on McCrory Road in the West Fall Development. A paved walking track is available at the Stokesdale Elementary School; the other is\nlocated on the Vulcan Materials, Inc. property. Dawn Acres Golf Course is a private facility located at the intersection of N.C. 68 and Haw River Road.\nWhile not located within Stokesdale, Belews Lake is located just west of town. Owned by Duke Power, Inc., this site is very popular during the summer\nfor many forms of recreation, including boating, fishing, and swimming. Many visitors to Belews Lake travel through Stokesdale on their way to and\nfrom the lake.\nHistoric Structures\nOriginally founded as a small farming community, there are many old farmhouses, tobacco barns, and other farm structures that still exist throughout\nthe rural areas of the town. In 1994, the Historic Architecture Inventory for Guilford County was completed. The Community Facilities Map indicates\nthe locations of the historic structures that were identified through this process a full listing of historic structures in Stokesdale is provided in\nAppendix A. Stokesdale is fortunate to have numerous examples of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century commercial and residential\nstructures. These structures provide a visual connection between the past and present. The Plan recognizes the importance of these structures and\nencourages property owners to protect these historic buildings through preservation and rehabilitation.\nThe initial business development of Stokesdale created a small, well-defined commercial core along Main Street (US 158) across from the train depot\nwhich was moved to a location outside the Town limit, in 1977. These structures provide a classic example of small town commercial architecture.

The two cover photographs show examples of the early\nDowntown, and there are current efforts to redevelop the structures.\nDowntown also has a significant number of historic residential structures, mainly located along Stokesdale Street, Main Street, and Ellisboro Road.\nStructures range from Queen Anne Victorian \"gingerbread\" houses to the more restrained locally adapted arts and crafts bungalows. A number of\nthese structures are under renovation by new owners interested in preservation.

Some new residential developments have used community well\nsystems, but none have used community septic systems. There are two levels of community septic systems: those that serve less than 3000 gallons\nper day (approximately 6 dwelling units) and those that serve more than 3000 gallons per day. Guilford County Health Department can approve the\nsmall disposal systems; the State Department of Environment & Natural Resources must approve the larger ones.\nDue to the limitations of septic systems, soil types are important when determining suitable locations for development. The USDA Soil Conservation\nService developed a countywide soils map in 1977. This study provided staff the information necessary to classify the general soil types by the ability\nto percolate for septic fields. There are no soils in Stokesdale that are classified as \"good\" for septic fields. A significant portion of the town does have\n\"moderate\" soils. There are also a number of areas that are considered \"severe\" for septic systems. These include areas along the floodplains and\ncreeks of the town and areas of high clay content. Many of these soils are located in the southwest corner of the town (Stokesdale Soil Map)\nWater System\nCurrently, all residents and commercial developments have private or community well systems. In the spring of 2000, Stokesdale received a three\nmillion-dollar grant from North Carolina Department of Environmental Health and Natural Resources (NCDENR) to develop a public water system. This\nwas in response to the eight known contaminated well sites found along U.S. 158. Winston-Salem is providing a maximum of 300,000 gallons of water\nper day through an inter-basin transfer allowance agreement. As of summer 2000, over 400 households and business owners have indicated that they\nwish to be served with public water. Final plans for the water system have not been determined, but it appears downtown Stokesdale and areas along\nN.C. 158 toward Southard Road will be served.\nGroundwater Contamination\nThe Stokesdale Environmental Constraints Map indicates that there are at least eight contaminated well sites along the old railroad bed and U.S. 158.\nThe two main causes are leaking underground gasoline storage tanks and (Ethyldibromide) EDB contamination. In all cases, the County and State\nEnvironmental Health Departments are investigating and working with the owners on remediation efforts. The drilling of new wells within 1,500 feet\nof contamination sites requires County Health Department approval. Due to this contamination, Stokesdale sought and received the grant to develop\na public water system.\nWatershed\nStokesdale does not have its own watershed requiring protection for a public water system. A portion of Stokesdale, however, drains into two public\nwater systems, the Dan River and Troublesome Creek watersheds. Almost 30% of the land area of Stokesdale (3,600 acres) is located within these two\nwatersheds. The Environmental Constraints Map shows the location of the watersheds along the northern border of the town. The Development\nOrdinance watershed regulations require that lots within a watershed must be at least 40,000 square feet in size.\nFloodplain\nThree perennial streams in the town have mapped 100-year floodplains. A floodplain is the channel and the relatively flat area adjoining the channel\nof a stream or river that periodically floods. The three mapped floodplains are found on King's Creek (western area of town), Troublesome Creek\n229 of 241\n10/25/2023, 8:58 AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTown of Stokesdale\nCELL (1, 2): \nSoil\nSuitability\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \n*Note: Proposed Roads, Trails, etc. are approximate locations only\nROCKINGHAM COUNTY\nCELL (2, 2): \nSoil Suitability for Septic\nTank Absorbtion Fields\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nModerate\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nSevere/Clay\nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nSevere\nFloods/Wetness\nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nUrban/Altered\nCELL (6, 3): \nCELL (7, 1): \nDORSETT\nCELL (7, 2): \n*Note: There are solls classified as\nGood for Septic systems Stokesdale\nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (8, 1): \nHAW RIVER\nO\nCELL (8, 2): \nSource: Soil Survey Guilford County, NC\nUSDA Soil Conservation Service, 1977\nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \nScale: 1\" 3000'\nCELL (9, 3): \nCELL (10, 1): \nProduced by the Guilford County Planning & Development Mapping Section - September 2001\nCELL (10, 2): \nCELL (10, 3): \n"}, {"page": "230", "text": "Stokesdale, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n(northeastern area & Reidsville Watershed), and the Haw River (southeastern border of town). (See Environmental Constraints Map). These floodplains\nmake up approximately 5% of the total land area of the town. Construction within the floodplain can obstruct stream flows during flooding and\nincrease flood damage. Preserving the floodplains and limiting activities to those with the least negative impacts, such as recreation, parking, and\ngarden areas, can reduce potential flood plain damage. For this reason, the Stokesdale Development Ordinance requires the dedication of floodplain,\nas public open space, as development occurs. For many years, Guilford County and Stokesdale's intent has been to link these dedicated areas to\ncreate a system of greenways.\nCritical Habitats\nA joint report of Guilford County and the North Carolina Natural Heritage Foundation has identified three critical habitat areas of general importance\nto the community. The largest is the King's Creek Slopes located along King's Creek near Belews Lake. This is a mixed hardwood forest with American\nShinleaf, Showy Orchids, and the regionally rare Waterleaf. The other sites, Pearman's Quarry Woods and Anthony Road Holler are both located in\nwestern Stokesdale. These two sites include Dry-Mesic and Mesic mixed hardwood forests and American Shinleaf. (See Environmental Constraints\nMap, and Appendix B)\nTransportation\nExisting and future land uses within Stokesdale have been, and will continue to be, impacted by its road network. Property values and the town's\nappearance can be damaged or enhanced by its roads. Traffic congestion can be reduced and travel time can improved by properly interconnecting\nstreets. By following the town's thoroughfare plan and carefully guiding connections as development occurs, the road network will be able to\naccommodate the level of service required for existing and future travel needs within and across its jurisdiction.\nProduced by the Gui ford County Planning & Development Mapping Section - September 2001\nRoad Classification & Current Transportation Improvement Program Plans\nStokesdale Transportation Network consists of four street classifications:\n1) Freeway: Proposed U.S. 220/NC 68 Connector (I-73). Adjacent to the town's eastern boundary, this facility will function to serve regional needs\nby connecting the Piedmont Triad with Southern Virginia. This facility will have significant land use impacts along existing U.S. 220 at its\nintersection with U.S. 158.\nFreeways are usually limited access, divided highways. Their over-all function is to move traffic on a regional basis.\n2) Thoroughfares: US 158, N.C. 68, N.C. 65, and Haw River Road.\nProposed U.S. 158 bypass.

This includes roads not classified on one of the higher systems. They are\nusually shorter segments found in residential subdivisions as cul-de-sacs, loop streets, and streets serving less than one hundred dwelling units.\nHazardous Intersections\nAs shown on the Transportation Map, Stokesdale currently has two recognizable hazardous intersections. The first is located at Ellisboro Road and\nN.C. 65; the second is at the intersection of N.C. 65 and N.C. 68. As development occurs in these areas measures should be implemented to alleviate\ntraffic conflicts at these intersections. This can be accomplished during rezoning requests or as individuals apply for driveway permits through the\nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) Additionally, the town could request that NCDOT conduct studies to determine what action is\nneeded to improve traffic safety at these locations.\nVISION STATEMENT\nStokesdale should be a town that is quiet and attractive that promotes the \"small town\" nature of the community. Effort should be made to preserve,\nmaintain, and enhance the rural character, natural habitat, and beauty of the community. There should be a sense of community through both formal\nand informal association. Residential development should enhance the community through appropriate neighborhood design, connectivity, and\nenvironmental protection of the town's natural resources. The historic nature of the town, especially its downtown, should be preserved and\nmaintained through the addition of businesses and services that cater to the citizens and are in harmony with existing development. Effort should be\nmade to create and enhance the sense of a vibrant community that is safe and convenient for all citizens. The town should promote alternative\nmodes of transportation, including pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian movement throughout the community.\nLAND USE PLAN\nStokesdale will achieve this vision through the recognition and enhancement of existing land uses along with the implementation of the\nrecommended future land use pattern. These areas are recognized as the Central Business District, Town Core, Residential Area, and Rural Residential\nArea. Additionally, proposed Neighborhood Business Areas, Scenic Corridors, Open Space/Trail Network, and Transportation System improvements\nwill further advance this vision (see Stokesdale Future Land Use Map).\nCentral Business District\nTown Vision: Stokesdale should be a town that promotes the \"small town\" nature Sense of community through both formal and informal\nassociation Historic nature of the town, especially its downtown.

A community park\nis proposed for the area near the Stokesdale Elementary School. This park would be centrally located and available for both school and community\nactivities with connections to a future trail system. The Plan builds upon the existing residential component by encouraging compact multi-family and\nsingle family development while maintaining current residential densities. Open space areas surrounding this growth would supply needed septic\nareas and green space. Streets would be interconnected and sidewalks and trails are recommended to encourage connections between the Town\nCore and surrounding areas.\nResidential Development Area\nTown Vision: Stokesdale should be a town With a sense of community through both formal and informal association Residential development\nshould enhance the community through appropriate neighborhood design, connectivity, and environmental protection.

As within the Town Core, the Plan emphasizes the need for\ninterconnected residential development through street and trail links to create neighborhoods where social interaction will occur. This will promote a\nsense of community, safety, and accessibility for residents.\nThe Plan recommends two commercial/office areas to complement the existing residential area. The site at the N.C. 65 and U.S. 158 intersection,\ncurrently zoned commercial, would support a small-scale shopping facility. A neighborhood commercial/office area is also proposed at the\nintersection of N.C. 68 and Haw River Road. The Plan recommends 2-3 acres for commercial use and 2-3 acres for office use. Significant landscape\nbuffers and traffic access management would be required. As shown on the Future Land Use Map, additional road connections are proposed to\nfacilitate improved traffic movement and safety. No new industrial areas are proposed due to the number of areas currently zoned but undeveloped\nfor these use along U.S. 158 east of the Town Core.\nRural Residential Development Area\nTown Vision: Effort should be made to preserve, maintain, and enhance the rural character, natural habitat, and beauty.

Additional road connections are\nrecommended in the Coldwater Road area to facilitate north-south movement between N.C. 65 and U.S. 158. No new industrial uses are proposed\ndue to the number of areas currently zoned and developed within Stokesdale for this use.\nOpen Space/Trail System\nTown Vision: Effort should be made to preserve, maintain, and enhance the rural character, natural habitat, and beauty. Sense of community\nthrough formal and informal association Sense of a vibrant community. Safe and convenient for all citizens Promote alternative modes of\ntransportation, including pedestrian, bicycle, and requestrian movement throughout the community.\nWith growth, Stokesdale will lose some of its rural character and open space areas. The Plan recommends providing additional recreational\nopportunities in the form of community parks and trails, to supplement existing resources. As shown on the Future Land Use Map, a linear park is\nproposed along Stokesdale Street and a community park is recommended adjacent to Stokesdale Elementary School. The Stokesdale Street Linear\nPark will serve to improve main street aesthetics and provide a connection within the proposed town trail system. Throughout the Town Core, efforts\nshould be made to provide connections to this park. The proposed Community Park will serve both the town and the school by providing areas for\nactive and passive recreation. As shown on the future land use map, proposed trail systems are recommended to connect with this park.\nIn order to connect the town, encouragement of pedestrian/bicycle activity and allow for safe requestrian-movement, trails are recommended\nthroughout the town from the CBD to the town limits. For the most part, these trails will follow floodplain areas or abandoned railway alignments. In\norder to achieve north-south connections, the Plan proposes two trails outside these areas. Development of this system will be through either\nvoluntary or required dedication during the development of new residential or commercial properties. Finally, the Plan recommends protecting areas\nshown as \"Critical Habitats\" on the Environmental Constraints Map from any future development. These sites are located in the western and\nsouthwestern areas of the town. Should growth occur in these areas, habitat protection strategies should be included in the development proposals.\nTransportation\nTown Vision: Stokesdale should be a town that promotes the \"small town\" nature of the community Residential development should enhance\nthe community through appropriate connectivity. that is safe and convenient for all citizens.\nExisting and future land uses within Stokesdale will continue to be impacted by its road network. By following the town's thoroughfare plan and\ncarefully guiding connections as development occurs, the road network will be able to accommodate the level of service required for safe and efficient\ntravel within and across the jurisdiction. The major components of the transportation plan are as follows:\nIn order to minimize future driveway cuts and improve traffic movement along portions of existing U.S. 158, the plan recommends that a portion of\nU.S. 158 between N.C. 65 and proposed U.S. 158 By-pass be reclassified as a major thoroughfare.\nRoad connections are recommended to provide links between thoroughfares and interconnect neighborhoods. Future connections will be made as\ndevelopment occurs.\nEfforts to re-invigorate downtown are closely linked to the development of the U.S. 158 bypass to remove the heavy truck traffic from downtown\nStokesdale.\nScenic Corridors\nTown Vision: Stokesdale should be a town that is quiet and attractive that promotes the \"small town\" nature Effort should be made to preserve,\nmaintain, and enhance the rural character, natural habitat, and beauty..

These corridors extend 1,500 feet on either side of the town's major highways and apply only to development that can be seen from\nthe public thoroughfares. The standards apply only to construction of new commercial buildings, and large residential subdivisions (Appendix C). The\nsignificant features of the scenic corridors are as follows:\nNon-residential buildings should be of brick, stone, wood, or other natural materials similar in size, scale, and architecture to existing buildings. This\nwill lead to visual continuity between old and new buildings, and the prevention of large flat blank expanses typical of large \"box\" development.\nWithin the Town Core, parking should be located to the side or behind buildings.

County General habitats are sites that either have: 1) rare\nplant or animal species of small population, or 2) aesthetic appearance that is of strong appeal.\nAppendix C\nDesign Guidelines for Scenic Corridors\nScenic corridors are designated along streets and highways that are gateways to the Town of Stokesdale, and provide an important first impression of\nthe area. The Scenic Corridors shown on the Future Land Use map extend 1,500 feet on either side of the designated thoroughfares, unless there are\nnatural or man-made features that block the line of site from the protected thoroughfare less than 1,500 feet from the road.\n1. Buildings\nAll non-residential building exteriors visible from the scenic corridors should be brick, stone, wood, or other natural materials. Corrugated\nand/or sheet metal is not permitted unless screened by a planting yard.\nThe size and scale of new buildings should be similar to that of existing buildings in the area.\nThe architectural style of new buildings should be similar to or compatible with that of surrounding buildings.\nThere should be a visual continuity between old and new buildings.\nLarge, flat blank expanses on a facade are not acceptable. The large \"box\" development is not appropriate (i.e., warehouse building and large\nretail store).\n2. Site Access\nMultiple accesses along a roadway frontage, which result in complicated or confusing traffic patterns, are not permitted. This will be\naccomplished through guidelines within the Stokesdale Development Ordinance, section 4-8.3, and Scenic Corridor Overlay District\nRequirements.\n3. Parking\nWithin the Town Core parking must be behind or at the side of the buildings.\nLandscape parking areas to screen them from the corridor and surrounding areas. Also, use landscaping in the interior of parking areas to\ndefine vehicular and pedestrian paths.\nOutside Town Core, new gas station pump islands and drive-through windows are required to be behind the building.\n4. Signs\nNo billboards.\nWithin Town Core, awning and monument signs only.\nAllow monument signs, wooden signs, and signs on buildings. Freestanding signs should be no higher than six feet in height nor more than 50\nsquare feet in area.\nRequire unobtrusive signage that is compatible in scale, size, material, and character with the building.\nSigns should have indirect lighting or cutout letters.\n5. Communication Towers\nCommunication towers should be set back a minimum of twice the tower's height from all Scenic Corridor boundaries.\n6. Fences\nLimit chainlink or similar fencing to back or side yards in non-residential areas with the use of shrubbery or climbing vines to minimize the\nappearance from the street. Fences of natural materials (i.e., wood, stone, etc...) would be permitted along street frontages.\n7.

In neighborhoods children use streets as play areas and\nadults walk and ride bicycles along them. Social interaction between neighbors takes place, and in some cases, street or block parties are held. Along\nroads with commercial development streets provide parking, sidewalks for pedestrian movement, and social interaction between people.\nTraffic calming is a compilation of tools that work together to slow and manage traffic. These include everything from traffic lights and stop signs, to\nnarrowing lanes and speed bumps. It also involves making the driver aware that they are entering an area where speed limits have been reduced and\nto expect other forms of traffic.\nThe Stokesdale Land Use Plan Committee has recommended that attempts be made to \"calm\" traffic in the Town Core Area. The most important of\nthese efforts is the construction of the 158 by-pass to remove the heavy truck traffic from the Downtown. However, this is a long-term effort that may\ntake a decade or more to be realized. Short-term efforts that can be implemented over the next few years include the following:\nCreate a feeling of \"narrowing\" for Main Street (US 158) from N.C. 68 to N.C. 65 through:\nPlanting street trees and the creating of a linear park along the abandoned railroad right-of-way.\nInstituting parallel parking along U.S. 158 as commercial development and redevelopment occurs.\nReducing setbacks for new buildings to create a \"visual narrowing\" or \"enclosure\" of the view from the vehicle.\nProvide safe pedestrian crossing areas through:\nUpgrading of crosswalks at important intersections to clearly define their locations by the use of special pavers and/or markings, and signalized\npedestrian crossings.\nAlert drivers that they are entering Downtown through:\nSignage posted before the two major intersections alerting drivers to fact that they are entering an area of more intense pedestrian activity. This\ncan include flashing lights, \"gateways,\" or other attractive signage.\n(Ord. of 9-20-2001(1); Ord. of 4-9-2007(1))\nCODE COMPARATIVE TABLE\nThis table gives the location within this Code of those ordinances which are included herein.
