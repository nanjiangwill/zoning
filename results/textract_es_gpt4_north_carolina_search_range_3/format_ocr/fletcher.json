The Fletcher Planning Board is granted special authority (as per Section 14.1 of\nthe code) to review and approve all development applications within the HOF-O (excluding\nsingle family and duplex residential construction as permitted). The Planning Board may attach\nreasonable conditions and recommendations (as per Section 15.14 of this code) to assure that the\nproposed development meets the spirit and intent of the Heart of Fletcher Overlay.\nThe recommended standards will be applicable to the development situations listed below that\nare within the HOF-O boundaries shown on the attached map.\nNew construction\nAdditions, Reconstruction or Renovations of existing structures which is equal\nor greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of tax value of the existing structure.\n(Expansions or enlargements of existing institutional and governmental uses shall be\nexempt from the maximum setback requirements from the Highway 25 corridor, but shall\nadhere to all other applicable development regulations unless otherwise specified)\nThe Heart of Fletcher Overlay (HOF-O) is divided into six (6) precincts, including Town Center\nCore, Town Center Business, Town Center Gateway, Town Center Neighborhood Business,\nTown Center Housing - East, and Town Center Housing - West.

The Town Center Gateway Precinct provides the first impression of the Town to visitors\nand promotes a welcoming appearance.\nThe guidelines contained in the Heart of Fletcher Overlay (HOF-O) should be used as a\nreference tool to promote urban, pedestrian-friendly developments within the town's center.\nDevelopers shall comply with the following guidelines and will adhere to review procedures by\nthe Administrator, the Planning Board and/or the Town Council as stipulated in Article 15 of this\nCode.
