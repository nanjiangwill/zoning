A map showing the proposed thoroughfare right-of-way has\nbeen placed on file with the Planning Departments of the Town of\nGibsonville and Alamance County.\nThe By-Pass route will connect with NC 100 at a point Northwest of the\nTown of Elon College, and is intended to circumvent the Town of\nGibsonville on its Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest sides to rejoin\nwith NC 100 at a point approximately one mile Southwest of the Town of\nGibsonville corporate limits.\nIt is anticipated that this outer loop around the Town of Gibsonville will\nhelp to alleviate congestion in the downtown area caused by traffic\nattempting to traverse NC Highway 100 through the center of town.\ni.\nLand Uses Along Corridor: Currently, most of the properties through\nwhich the By-Pass is projected to travel are zoned Agricultural (AG),\nalthough a smaller number of RS-12 and RS-20 zoned properties are\nalso included within the proposed right-of-way. There are no\nsubstantial housing or commercial developments lying within the\nproposed right-of-way.

In\n1990, US 70 had a recorded annual average daily traffic count of between\n6,200-6,800 vehicles. US 70 is scheduled under the 1992 NC DOT\nTransportation Improvement Program to be expanded from two to four\nlanes.\ni.\nLand Uses Along Corridor: With the exception of several\nproperties lying at the intersection of US 70 & NC 61, and the\nintersection of US 70 & Springwood Church Road ( which contains\nseveral businesses and a small mobile home park), the vast\nmajority of property lying within this proposed scenic corridor is\nzoned Agricultural (AG). Additionally, US 70 borders the Whitsett\ncommunity, an area lying to the South of US 70 and along both\nsides of NC 61.

Industrial development is zoned primarily within the\nRock Creek Corporate Park located near the I-85 & Rock Creek Dairy\nRoad interchange (located approximately two miles Southwest of the\nTown of Gibsonville).

Springwood Church Road is designated in Section E of the\nGibsonville Transportation Study and Thoroughfare Plan as a Major\nThoroughfare. In 1990, Springwood Church Road had a recorded annual\naverage daily traffic count of 1,400 vehicles between US 70 and the\ntown's corporate limits, and 500 vehicles between US 70 and I-85.\ni.\nLand Uses Along Corridor: The property on both sides of\nSpringwood Church Road from US 70 South to I-85 is a mixture\nof open land, agricultural, rural, and very low density\nresidential areas.

It offers\nresidents and businesses in the community access to large metropolitan\nareas located in the North central portion of the state.\nAn additional factor contributing to the importance of NC 61 to the\ncommunity is its impact on the perceptions of people traveling to the\narea to visit or conduct business. The I-85 & NC 61 interchange is\ndesignated by signs along I-85 as the major exit for traffic traveling to\nGibsonville. This make NC 61 a major gateway into the community. As\nsuch, the visual presentation that it gives to people and businesses\nlooking to relocate to the area could have a significant impact on their\nperception of Gibsonville as a desirable place to live and work.\nFinally, NC 61 traverses the middle of the Whitsett community, an\narea lying between the town's extraterritorial limits and I-85.
