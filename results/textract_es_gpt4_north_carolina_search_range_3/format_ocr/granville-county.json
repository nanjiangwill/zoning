STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND INTENT OF DISTRICTS\nSec. 32-61. Agricultural residential district 80 (AR-80).\nThe AR-80 district is established to promote a compatible mixture of agricultural, forestry, conservation and very-low-density residential uses where few public services will be available. This district aims to preserve the environment\nthrough protection of prime farm land and water quality in the WSW-II critical area in water supply watersheds.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.210)\nCross reference- Animals, ch 11.\nSec. 32-62. Agricultural residential district 40 (AR-40).\nThe AR-40 district is established to promote a compatible mixture of agricultural, forestry, conservation and very-low-density residential uses where few public services will be available. Protection of the environment, preservation of\nprime farm land, and the continuation of rural lifestyles are goals this district seeks to attain.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.211)\nCross reference- Animals, ch 11.\nSec. 32-63 Residential district (R-25).\nThe R-25 district is established primarily as a medium-density residential district where off-site water and sewer is available.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.212)\nSec. 32-64. Manufactured home park district (MHPD).\nThe MHPD district is established to provide areas for manufactured or mobile home parks or subdivisions where singlewide units are permitted.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.213)\nCross reference- Subdivisions, app. A.\nSec. 32-65 Highway business district (HB).\nThe purpose of the HB district shall be to provide for and encourage the proper grouping and development of uses primarily along major roads for businesses that want a location with access to higher volumes of traffic. It is also\nintended to provide locations for businesses which will best accommodate the needs of the motoring public. The standards are intended to reduce highway congestion and hazard and to ensure that the uses are not a blight on the\ncounty's character.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.214)\nSec. 32-66. Neighborhood business district (NB).\nThe NB district is established for business development serving the business needs of the rural community. The size and uses in the district are intended to serve the community, rather than regional or highway markets.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.215)\nSec. 32-67. Prime industrial district (I-1).\nThe purpose of the I-1 district is to establish and provide areas for high-quality industrial, manufacturing, wholesaling and warehousing operations.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.216)\nSec. 32-68 General industrial district (I-2).\nThe purpose of the I-2 district is to establish and preserve areas for heavy industrial and related uses and is designed to accommodate all but the most objectionable industries; however, industries permitted by right are required to\nminimize their emission of smoke, dust, fumes, glare, noise and vibrations. This district should be separated from residential areas whenever possible by natural or structural features such as sharp breaks in topography, strips of\nvegetation or traffic arteries. This district shall be located adjacent to and/or with direct access to thoroughfare roads or streets.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.217)\nSec. 32-69. Office/institutional district (O/I).\nThe purpose of the O/I district is to provide locations for medium-intensity office and institutional land use and to function as a buffer between districts which may conflict with one another. Generally, these areas should have water\nand sewer mains that either exist at the site or are to be made available during the development process. The maximum amount of land to be zoned as an O/I classification should not exceed eight acres if the site is surrounded by high-\ndensity residential development. In addition, vehicular access must consist of direct ingress and egress to a public road classified as either arterial or collector as designated by the thoroughfare plan for the county prepared by the state\ndepartment of transportation and adopted by the board of commissioners.\n2 of 100\n7/3/2024. 1:25 PM\n"}, {"page": "3", "text": "Granville County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 02.218)\nSec. 32-70.

TYPES OF SUBDIVISIONS\nSec. 32-601 Designated.\nThere are three principal types of subdivisions: subdivision. Different\nprocedures and standards apply generally to major and minor subdivisions. The number of lots specified in this division shall include all lots in the subdivision, whether they are new, existing or a combination. The number of lots applies\nwhether it is a new street or an existing street. Major subdivisions must submit preliminary and final plans and are encouraged to submit a sketch plan. Minor subdivisions may go straight from sketch to final plan. All major subdivisions\nmust build roads to public or private road standards. Family subdivisions are permitted lower standard roads.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 10.100)\nSec. 32-602 Major subdivisions.\n(a) A major subdivision is a subdivision of land that is not a minor subdivision meeting the standards in section 32-603 or an exception as defined in section 32-582. Major subdivisions shall be developed in conformance with\ndivision 3 of this article. A minimum of ten percent of a major subdivision shall be reserved for active recreation. Land within the subdivision site not contained in lots, streets, or utility easements, shall be in one or more\nparcels dedicated or reserved as permanent open space for active recreational uses. Open space dedication or reservation and maintenance shall be the same as found in section 32-602(b)(6) and (7).\n(b) A cluster subdivision is an allowable major subdivision design in rural areas of the county.\n(1) Purpose. Clustering of residential lots is intended to encourage subdivision design that is more efficient and better suited to the natural features of the land than a conventional subdivision, by regulating lots based on lot\ndensity standards rather than minimum lot size standards and by requiring that part of the subdivision not devoted to lots and roads be set aside as usable open space. This allows smaller lots to be concentrated on those\nparts of the subdivision best suited to accommodate development with the least adverse impact. Clustering also allows smaller and less costly network of roads and utilities and reduces the amount of impervious surface\nand stormwater runoff. The open space provided by clustering can be used to provide recreational opportunities for the subdivision's residents, to conserve and protect significant natural areas and environmentally\nsensitive areas, and to preserve important historic resources.\nIn WS II watersheds, state rules will not allow lots less than 40,000 square feet in area when septic tanks are used.\n(2) Clustering of lots shall not be allowed on any tract of land less than ten acres in size.\n(3) Maximum number of lots (lot density). Clustering shall not increase the density of development.\nThe maximum number of lots allowed within a cluster subdivision shall be equal to the site's total land area (acreage), less the street rights-of-way, divided by the minimum lot size of the non-clustered subdivision. The\ndensity for WS II critical watershed is .50 dwellings per acre per state law.\n(4) Lot design standards. Each lot shall be regularly shaped and meet the following dimensional standards:\na. Minimum lot size shall be 40,000 square feet.\nb. Minimum lot width shall be 85 feet.\nC. Minimum setbacks shall be 50 feet street yard, 15 feet side yard and 25 feet rear yard.\n(5) Open space.\na. Required open space. Land within the subdivision site not contained in lots, streets, or utility easements, shall be in one or more parcels dedicated or reserved as permanent open space. The total area of parcels\ndedicated or reserved as permanent open space shall make up at least 30 percent of the subdivision (with a minimum of ten percent of the subdivision used for active recreation).\nb. Open space use, location, and design.\n1. Open space shall be dedicated or reserved for one or more of the following uses:\nConservation of any identifiable natural hazard areas, such as floodways or wetlands;\nConservation and protection of identified significant natural areas, such as rare plant communities, important wildlife habitat, or other environmentally sensitive areas where development might threaten water\nquality of ecosystems;\nConservation and protection of any identifiable important historic resources;\nProvision of active and/or passive outdoor recreation opportunities, either for the general public or for the subdivision residents:\nRetention of productive farmland or forestland for continued agricultural and/or forestry use; or\nEstablish a conservation reservation on the remainder of the tract.\n2. Highest priority for the location, design, and use of open space (not including the required minimum ten percent used for active recreation) shall be given to conserving, and avoiding development in, any natural\nhazard areas on the site.\n3. Open space shall contain such buildings, structures, accessways, and parking facilities as are necessary to its principal uses.\n4. The location, size, character, and shape of the required open space shall be appropriate to its intended use; active recreation shall be located and designed so its users can easily access it.\n(6) Open space dedication or reservation.\na. Land within the subdivision site not contained in lots, streets, or utility easements, shall be in one or more contiguous parcels dedicated or reserved as permanent open space. The title to the open space shall be\nconveyed to a property owners' association, homeowners' association, or other legal entity (public agency or nonprofit organization) that is capable of and willing to accept responsibility for managing the open space\nfor its intended purpose.\nb. Each dedicated or reserved open space parcel shall be shown on all subdivision plans and on record plat recorded with the county register of deeds, with a notation of its area and its intended open space use.\n(7)\nMaintenance of open space. The owner of the open space shall be responsible for maintaining the open space so that is continues to effectively function for its intended use and any dedication or conveyance of an open\nspace parcel shall provide for such responsibility.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 10.110; Ord. of 4-3-2000, \u00a7 13; Amend.

In order to maintain the lowest cost for this purpose, dirt roads (section 32-674) are permitted. To\nprevent abuse, there is a penalty incurred for selling a lot to a nonfamily member. A family member shall be allowed one lot, one time under a family subdivision plat process; all further subdivision is prohibited under this\nsection, and the subdivision is converted to a minor subdivision under section 32-603. Making road improvements to install a gravel road or public street is very costly and based on past experience unlikely to occur. Thus, a\nwarning shall appear on all plats indicating that the access to a lot is a private road right-of-way with no means of enforcing the cost of maintenance. Eligibility for a family subdivision is as prescribed in subsection (b) of this\nsection.\n(b) All lots must be transferred to a lineal family member. This shall include only direct lineal descendants (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren), direct lineal ascendants (father, mother, grandfather, grandmother) and\n61 of 100\n7/3/2024, 1:25 PM\n"}, {"page": "62", "text": "Granville County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nspouses.

GENERAL DESIGN REVIEW\nSec. 32-621 General subdivision review.\nThe purpose of a general subdivision review is to evaluate the design-more specifically, the manner in which uses, lots, drainage and roads relate to the site and adjoining land. The purpose is not to review or modify the proposed\nuse or intensity; these shall be in accordance with the requirements of the district in which the development is proposed. The review of a subdivision plat or land development plan shall apply the following:\n(1) To ensure that new subdivision developments in the county will have a safe potable water supply and an adequate sewage disposal system.\n(2) To ensure proper design and adequate construction of roads, drainage facilities and utilities.\n(3) To assure quality in the design of land developments in the county and the equitable allocation of costs involved between those who shall benefit financially from the development and the taxpaying public as a whole.\n(4) To provide assurances to the county resident who purchases property within subdivisions that site improvements have been made in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, thereby protecting the long-term\nvalue of the property.\n(5)\nTo prevent the pollution of air, streams and watersheds; to assure the adequacy of drainage facilities; to protect the water table; and to encourage the rational and efficient utilization and management of natural resources\nthroughout the county in order to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the community and the value of the land.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 10.210)\nSec. 32-622. Blocks.\nThe following standards shall be applied to the design of blocks within subdivisions:\n(1) Intersecting streets shall be laid out at such intervals that block lengths are not more than 1,200 feet nor less than 400 feet.\n(2) Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except where otherwise required to separate residential development from through traffic or nonresidential uses.\n(3) Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet in width, shall provide adequate pedestrian circulation or access to schools, shopping areas, churches, parks, playgrounds, transportation or other similar facilities.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 10.220)\nSec. 32-623. Lots.\nLots shall be reviewed based on the following standards:\n(1) All lot sizes shall meet the standards of this chapter.\n(2)\nThe shapes, size and locations of lots and lot lines shall be made with due regard to topographic conditions, contemplated uses and the surrounding area.\n(3) Land subject to flooding and land deemed by other regulatory agencies to be uninhabitable for other specific reasons shall not be platted for residential occupancy or for any uses where flooding may increase danger to\nhealth, life or property, or aggravate the flood hazard. Land may be set aside for such uses as will not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation.

Upgrading will have to include drainage and road improvement standards of\nthis\narticle.\n(2)\nType II. Type II is now called a gravel road. Subdivisions of four to nine lots were permitted to use this type of road. Such roads were constructed to meet all public road standards established by state department of\ntransportation division of highways, department of transportation minimum construction standards for subdivision roads, including a minimum of four inches of compacted stone. Such roads do not have to be paved.\nUpgrading will have to include paving the road to the standards of this article.\n(3)\nType III. Type III is a private street serving ten or more lots, constructed and paved to state department of transportation minimum standards for subdivision roads.

Coordination with surrounding streets; street connectivity requirements.\n(a) The board of commissioners hereby finds and determines that an interconnected street system is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare in order to ensure that streets will function in an\ninterdependent manner, to provide adequate access for emergency and service vehicles, to enhance nonvehicular travel such as pedestrians and bicycles, and to provide continuous and comprehensible traffic routes.\n(1) All proposed streets shall be continuous and connect to existing or platted streets without offset with the exception of cul-de-sacs as permitted and except as provided below. Whenever practicable, provisions shall be\nmade for the continuation of planned streets into adjoining areas.\n(2)\nThe street network for any subdivision shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than 1.40 (see contrasting illustrations in example 1 and 2). The phrase \"connectivity ratio\" means the number of streets links divided by\nthe number of nodes or link ends, including cul-de-sac heads. A \"link\" means and refers to that portion of a street defined by a node at each end or at one end. Approved stubs to adjacent property shall be considered\nlinks. However, alleys shall not be considered links. A \"node\" refers to the terminus of a street or the intersection of two or more streets, except that intersections that use a roundabout shall not be counted as a node. The\ncounty intends that roundabouts be used to calm and/or direct traffic. Roundabouts are typically most appropriate for intersections that meet the state DOT's warrants for a traffic signal. All proposed roundabouts must be\nreviewed and agreed upon by the state DOT district office during the preliminary plat phase.\n(3)\nFor the purposes of this section, the street links and nodes within the collector or thoroughfare streets providing access to a proposed subdivision shall not be considered in computing the connectivity ratio.\n(4) Residential streets shall be designed so as to minimize the length of local streets, to provide safe access to residences with minimal need for steep driveways and to maintain connectivity between and through residential\nneighborhoods for autos and pedestrians.\n(5) Where necessary to provide access or to permit the reasonable future subdivision of adjacent land, rights-of-way, and improvements shall be extended to the boundary of the development. A temporary turnaround may\nbe required where the dead end exceeds 500 feet in length. The platting of partial width rights-of-way shall be prohibited except where the remainder of the necessary right-of-way has already been platted, dedicated, or\nestablished by other means.\n(6) Exemption. New subdivisions that intend to provide one new cul-de-sac street shall be exempt from the connectivity ratio standard as set forth in this section, provide the planning board determines that there is:\na. No options for providing stub streets due to topographic conditions, adjacent developed sites, or other limiting factors; and\nb.\nInterconnectivity (use of a looped road) within the development cannot be achieved or is unreasonable based on the constraints of the property to be developed.\n(b) Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and convenient locations.\n(c) Subcollector, local, and minor residential streets shall connect with surrounding streets where necessary to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods or to facilitate access\nto\nneighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons, but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage the use of such streets by substantial through traffic.\n(d) Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of the subdivided property (or to the\nedge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In addition, the permit-issuing authority may require temporary turnarounds to\nbe constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency vehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this\nsubsection, no temporary dead-end street in excess of 1,000 feet may be created unless no other practicable alternative is available.\n(e) Reserve strips adjoining road rights-of-way for the purposes of preventing access to adjacent property shall not be permitted under any condition.\nSubdivision due\nExample 2 Same development\ndoes nos meet the Ratio\nmodified tn meet Rabo\n(13 Hales/1 nedes 1.18 ratio)\n(16 linkal andes 1.43 ratla)\n16\nFigure 1.

Traffic impact analysis.\nA traffic impact analysis (TIA) is required for high impact developments or subdivisions, as defined in this section. The TIA enables an assessment of the potential impact of a proposed development on the highway system. The\npurpose of the TIA is to ensure that proposed developments do not adversely affect the highway network and to identify any traffic problems associated with access from the site to the existing transportation network. The purpose of\nthe analysis is to also identify solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated into the proposed development.\n(1) A TIA shall be required for all proposed developments, or phases of development, or contiguous tracts under the same ownership, containing 80 or more dwelling units or where the estimated traffic generated from the\nsite exceeds 800 trips/day, according to the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual.\n(2) A TIA is required at the time of application and must be completed by a qualified professional transportation engineer. Prior to the preparation of a TIA, a scoping meeting shall be held with planning staff.

This article provides the user with a guide to the procedures to be followed and the criteria for making\ndecisions on each of the applications. It also provides for appeals from decisions taken to the courts.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, div. 21.000)\nSec. 32-1032 Procedure and administration.\n(a) Table 21.010A identifies the procedures and administration of various zoning actions. Subdivision and land development activities are presented in table 21.010B. Each of the tables is divided into groups of reviews that follow\na common format. The first column displays all the actual procedure, one to a row. Then, each type of decision has a column which contains two subcolumns. The first subcolumn, labeled \"Days,\" is the time limit that the\nagency has to conduct the proceedings. All times are in working days, except for the notice requirement which is in elapsed time. That column indicates the publication requirement for advertising (see division 6 of this article\nfor a complete summary of the public notice requirements). The second column, labeled \"Agency,\" indicates the responsible agency or board. Shaded areas indicate mandatory requirements. Where days and responsibilities\nare cited, but not shaded, the requirement is optional. If there is no language in a space, the procedure is not applicable.\n(b) A discussion of each of the steps follows in divisions 2 and 3. The discussion of each step deals only with technical requirements of each set, not the agency responsible, order or whether the step is mandatory, optional\nor\ninapplicable.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 21.010; Amend. of 1-16-2007, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2)\nTABLE 21.010A\nZONING PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION\n72 of 100\n7/3/2024, 1:25 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nMajor Special Land\nUse\nCELL (1, 3): \nMajor Special Land\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinor Special Uses,\nZoning Variances,\nAppeal\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinor Special Uses,\nZoning Variances,\nCELL (1, 6): \nZoning Ordinance,\nZoning Map, or\nWatershed Map\nCELL (1, 7): \nAmendments to\nZoning Ordinance,\nZoning Map, or\nWatershed Map\nCELL (1, 8): \nZoning Map\n(Conditional Zoning\nDistrict)\nCELL (1, 9): \nAmendments to\nZoning Map\n(Conditional Zoning\nCELL (1, 10): \nMajor Watershed\nVariances\nCELL (1, 11): \nMajor Watershed\nCELL (1, 12): \nMinor Watershed\nVariance\nCELL (1, 13): \nMinor Watershed\nCELL (1, 14): \nVested Right\nCELL (1, 15): \nVested Right\nCELL (1, 16): \nPermits; Limited\nUse, Zoning, Sign,\nOccupancy/\nCompliance Permits\nCELL (1, 17): \nPermits; Limited\nUse, Zoning, Sign,\nCompliance Permits\nCELL (2, 1): \nTypes\nCELL (2, 2): \nDays\nCELL (2, 3): \nAgency\nCELL (2, 4): \nDays\nCELL (2, 5): \nAgency\nCELL (2, 6): \nDays\nCELL (2, 7): \nAgency\nCELL (2, 8): \nDays\nCELL (2, 9): \nAgency\nCELL (2, 10): \nDays\nCELL (2, 11): \nAgency\nCELL (2, 12): \nDays\nCELL (2, 13): \nAgency\nCELL (2, 14): \nDays\nCELL (2, 15): \nAgency\nCELL (2, 16): \nDays\nCELL (2, 17): \nAgency\nCELL (3, 1): \nApplication\nCompleteness\nReview\nCELL (3, 2): \n1.\nCELL (3, 3): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (3, 4): \n1.\nCELL (3, 5): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (3, 6): \n1:\nCELL (3, 7): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (3, 8): \n1.\nCELL (3, 9): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (3, 10): \n1.\nCELL (3, 11): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (3, 12): \n1.\nCELL (3, 13): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (3, 14): \n1\nCELL (3, 15): \nCELL (3, 16): \nCELL (3, 17): \nCELL (4, 1): \nFee\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (4, 6): \nCELL (4, 7): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (4, 8): \nCELL (4, 9): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (4, 10): \nCELL (4, 11): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (4, 12): \nCELL (4, 13): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (4, 14): \nCELL (4, 15): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (4, 16): \nCELL (4, 17): \nCharged per\nPlanning Fee\nSchedule\nCELL (5, 1): \nApplication\nReview\nCELL (5, 2): \n30\nCELL (5, 3): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (5, 4): \n15.\nCELL (5, 5): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (5, 6): \n15.\nCELL (5, 7): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (5, 8): \n30\nCELL (5, 9): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (5, 10): \n15\nCELL (5, 11): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (5, 12): \n15\nCELL (5, 13): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (5, 14): \n***\nCELL (5, 15): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (5, 16): \n3\nCELL (5, 17): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (6, 1): \nNotice\nCELL (6, 2): \n.10\n-\n25*\nCELL (6, 3): \nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (6, 5): \nCELL (6, 6): \n10-\n25*\nCELL (6, 7): \nCELL (6, 8): \n10-\n25*\nCELL (6, 9): \nCELL (6, 10): \n10-\n25\nCELL (6, 11): \nCELL (6, 12): \nCELL (6, 13): \nCELL (6, 14): \nCELL (6, 15): \nCELL (6, 16): \nCELL (6, 17): \nCELL (7, 1): \nLegislative\nHearing\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (7, 6): \nCELL (7, 7): \nPlanning Board\nCELL (7, 8): \nCELL (7, 9): \nPlanning Board\nCELL (7, 10): \nCELL (7, 11): \nCELL (7, 12): \nCELL (7, 13): \nCELL (7, 14): \nCELL (7, 15): \nCELL (7, 16): \nCELL (7, 17): \nCELL (8, 1): \nRecommendation\nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \nCELL (8, 5): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (8, 6): \n30\nor\n45.\nCELL (8, 7): \nPlanning Board\nCELL (8, 8): \n45\nCELL (8, 9): \nPlanning Board\nCELL (8, 10): \nCELL (8, 11): \nBoard of\nAdjustment\nCELL (8, 12): \nCELL (8, 13): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (8, 14): \n***\nCELL (8, 15): \nLand\nDevelopment\nAdminist-\nrator\nCELL (8, 16): \nCELL (8, 17): \nCELL (9, 1): \nNotice\nCELL (9, 2): \n.10\n-\n25*\nCELL (9, 3): \nCELL (9, 4): \n.10\n-\n25*\nCELL (9, 5): \nCELL (9, 6): \n.10\n-\n25*\nCELL (9, 7): \nCELL (9, 8): \n.10\n-\n25*\nCELL (9, 9): \nCELL (9, 10): \nCELL (9, 11): \nCELL (9, 12): \n.10\n-\n25*\nCELL (9, 13): \nCELL (9, 14): \nCELL (9, 15): \nCELL (9, 16): \nCELL (9, 17): \n"}, {"page": "73", "text": "Granville County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nTABLE 21.010B\nSUBDIVISION PROCEDURES AND ADMINISTRATION\nNOTES:\nIndicates a mandatory submission.\nTime in working days.\n(Amend.

In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the\nappellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of\ndecisions granting a development approval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the development regulation shall not stay the further review of an application for development\napprovals to use such property; in these situations the appellant or local government may request and the board may grant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications, including building permits\naffected by the issue being appealed.\ng. Subject to the provisions of subsection f. above, the board of adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.\nh. The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the county would be unduly\nprejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision\nappealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The board shall have all powers of the official who made the decision.\ni.\nWhen hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. 160D-947(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. 160D-1402(j).\nj. The parties to an appeal that has been made under this subsection may agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution.\n(4) Minor special use permits. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide minor special use permits in accordance with standards and procedures specified in the ordinance. Reasonable and appropriate conditions may be\nimposed upon these permits.\n(5) Variances. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of the land development code, the board of adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the ordinance upon a showing that all of\nthe standards set out in G.S. 160D-705(d), as adopted in_section 32-1103 of the chapter, have been met. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any\nvariance, provided the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.

Procedures for watershed variances.\n(a) Review. Watershed variances shall be reviewed by the board of adjustment in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 32-1103 and division 6 of this article.\n(b) In addition, the following requirements set out in 15A NCAC 02B.0104 apply:\n(1) A description of each project receiving a variance and the reason for granting the variance shall be submitted to the environmental commission on an annual basis by January 1.\n(2)\nBoard of adjustment may attach conditions to the major or minor variance approval that support the purpose of the applicable local watershed protection ordinance.\n(3) If the variance request qualifies as a major variance, and the board of adjustment decides in favor of granting the major variance, the board of adjustment shall then prepare a preliminary record of the hearing and submit\nit to the environmental management commission for review and approval.\n(4) If the environmental management commission approves the major variance or approves with conditions or stipulations added, then the environmental management commission shall prepare an environmental\nmanagement commission decision which authorizes the board of adjustment to issue a final decision which would include any conditions or stipulations added by the environmental management commission.\n(5) If the environmental management commission denies the major variance, then the environmental management commission shall prepare an environmental management commission decision to be sent to the board of\nadjustment. The local board of adjustment shall prepare a final decision denying the major variance.\n(6) For all proposed major and minor variances the county shall notify and allow a reasonable comment period for all other local governments having jurisdiction within the watershed area governed by the applicable rules\nand the entity using the water supply for consumption.\n(7) Appeals from the board of adjustment's decision on a major or minor variance request are made on certiorari to the superior court. Appeals from the environmental management commission decision on a major variance\nrequest are made on judicial review to superior court.\n(8) When the county's ordinances are more stringent than the state's minimum water supply protection rules a variance to the county's ordinance is not considered a major variance as long as the result of the variance is not\nless stringent than the state's minimum requirements.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 21.240; Amend. of 10-21-2013, \u00a7 8)\nSec. 32-1085. Obtaining a vested right.\n(a) Authorized. As authorized under G.S. 160D-108, an applicant may obtain the right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of an approved site-specific or phased\ndevelopment plan. Only approved major special uses, minor special uses, permitted uses and approved phased developments may be granted a vested right under this section. Variances, all zoning of lands, and subdivisions\nare not in this category but are handled in a different manner.\n(b) Vested rights for major special uses and minor special uses.\n(1) If the land use requested by the applicant requires a major special use permit or a minor special use permit, the appropriate board granting such approval shall, if granted, determine at that evidentiary hearing date a\nspecific vested right time period for that use, as outlined in this subsection. Furthermore, it shall be irreversibly assumed by the county that all such applicants requesting a major special use or minor special use permit are\nalso concurrently requesting a vested right.\n(2)\nAll minor special uses and major special uses, if approved, shall begin and expire along with the vested right granted to each unless a building permit is issued prior to the expiration of the vested right, in which case, the\nmajor or minor special land use shall be good indefinitely or until changed by due process.\n(3) If a particular use necessitates several steps required by this chapter in order to obtain final approval, a vested right shall not be granted until the final decision regarding such requirements has been made.\n77 of 100\n7/3/2024, 1:25 PM\n"}, {"page": "78", "text": "Granville County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(4) A site-specific [development plan] must accompany each land use application involving a major special use or minor special use. Site-specific development plans, if approved, shall be granted an automatic maximum vested\nright time period of two years unless the applicant convinces the appropriate board otherwise; but in no case shall the vested right exceed five years. Site specific vesting plans, if approved, shall be granted a vested right\ntime period of not less than two years but not more than five years, at the discretion of the appropriate board.\n(c) Vested rights for permitted uses. If the land use requested by the applicant is a permitted use, the applicant has two ways of acquiring a vested right:\n(1) Local development approval shall expire one year after issuance unless work has substantially commenced. Expiration of a local development approval does not affect the duration of a vested right established as a site\nspecific vesting plan, a multiphase development plan, a development agreement, or vested rights established under common law; or\n(2) The building permit, if issued, shall constitute a vested right time period as prescribed by G.S. 160D-1111.\n(d) Site-specific development plan. If less than five acres, all major special uses, minor special uses and permitted uses discussed in this section applying for a vested right shall have site-specific development plans prepared by a\nregistered land surveyor, engineer, architect or landscape architect in accordance with appendix 7 to this chapter. Any hearing shall be per G.S. 160D-108(3)(d).\n(e) Phased development plan. A phased development plan for an industrial/office park, a shopping center, a PUD (planned urban development), multi-phase development or a similar large-scale land use (which may be eligible as\na permitted, minor special or major special use) may be granted a vested right by the final board of authority in a hearing per G.S. 160D-108(3)(d) under the following conditions:\n(1) The land use must encompass at least five acres or more to be eligible for a phased development plan. Furthermore, a minimum of two phases must be included in the plan with approximate start-up times (the time at\nwhich a building permit should be obtained) stated for each phase. The final deciding board may regard any phase of the plan as codependent upon another and therefore deem one or more to be void without the other.\nNo phase shall be vested beyond time limits established elsewhere in this section.\n(2) Where a subdivision or a PUD is involved, a preliminary plat for the development shall be submitted and approved. For developments not involving subdivision, an exact description of buildings, their specific uses, and their\nsetbacks, all the requirements set forth in appendix 7 shall be part of phased development plan. The preliminary design of roads and utilities shall also be submitted at the same level as would be required for a preliminary\nplat. The intent is that the plan show all the expected types and areas of construction, such as buildings, roads, lot configurations, parking, buffering, recreation areas, landscaping and similar improvements, and that they\nbe sited as near to their final locations as possible.\n(3) The vesting freezes the land development regulations in effect at the time of approval. The final board of authority shall retain the future right to impose or change some of the details of any phased development plan\n(or\nsite-specific plan), but only to a general degree as would normally occur in moving from a preliminary to final plan, and as provided for elsewhere in this chapter and in G.S. 160D-108. If some changes are required in the\napplicant's plan by a board during the approval process, final approval of either site-specific or phased development plans may be postponed conditional upon the applicant's making such changes and having them\napproved by the county planning department at a later date.\n(f)\nPublic notice. Public notices for each of these land uses described in this section and their accompanying vested rights shall be in accordance with division 6.\n(g) Filing procedure.\n(1) Following approval, all vested rights shall be filed in the planning department office in a designated location in order to be valid. This shall be the responsibility of the planning department.\n(2) The fee schedule for each of these land uses and their accompanying vested rights shall be established by the planning department and confirmed by the county commissioners in each year's budget. They shall then be\nposted in the planning department in a conspicuous location.\n(h) Expiration. All building permits for all vested construction must be in place prior to the expiration of the vested right in order for the vested right to be valid. If all required building permits are not in place prior to the\nexpiration of a vested right, the entire process as described in this section must be repeated in order to regain a vested right for that use. The exception to this rule is a use for which no building permit is required; however, a\nzoning permit shall be required. These time limits include all phases of a phased development plan and multi-phase developments as well. Prior to the expiration of a vested right, appeals to the final board of decision of that\nvested right for time extensions may be made in a hearing pursuant to G.S. 160D-108(3)(d) by the applicant if so desired, though the planning department may require a new plan and shall require another fee at such time.\n(i) Limitations to vested rights.\n(1) A vested right, once established as provided for in this section, precludes any zoning action by a local government that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the\nproperty as set forth in the approved vested right, except:\na. The written consent of the affected landowner.\nb. Upon findings by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health,\nsafety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the approved vested right.\nC. The extent to which the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all\narchitectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consulting fees incurred after approval by the local government, together with interest as is provided in G.S. 160D-106. Compensation shall not include any diminution\nin the value of the property that is caused by such action.\nd. Findings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the landowner or the landowner's representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a difference\nin the approval by the local government of the vested right.\ne. The enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the approved site specific vesting plan or the phased development plan, in which case the local\ngovernment may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding by ordinance that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, after notice and an evidentiary hearing.\n(2) The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning or other development regulation that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or\nordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by a county, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes.\nOtherwise applicable new regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a vested right established under this section upon the expiration or termination of the vested rights period provided\nfor in this section.\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a vested right under this section shall not preclude, change or impair the authority of a local government to adopt and enforce development regulation\nprovisions governing nonconforming situations or uses.\n(j) Miscellaneous provisions. A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a vested right under this section, all successors to the\noriginal landowner shall be entitled to exercise such rights. Nothing in this section shall preclude judicial determination, based on common law principles or other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular\ncase or that a compensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the existing common law.\n(k) Permit choice. If an application made in accordance with local regulation is submitted for a development approval required pursuant to this chapter and a development regulation changes between the time the application was\nsubmitted and a decision is made, the applicant may choose which version of the development regulation will apply to the application. If the development permit applicant chooses the version of the rule or ordinance\napplicable at the time of the permit application, the development permit applicant shall not be required to await the outcome of the amendment to the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit. This\nsection applies to all development approvals issued by the state and by local governments. The duration of vested rights created by development approvals is as set forth in this section.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 21.250; Amend. of 10-15-2012, 1; Amend. of 4-19-2021(2), \u00a7 1)\nSec. 32-1086. Moratoria.\n(a) Authority. As provided in this section, local governments may adopt temporary moratoria on any development approval required by law, except for the purpose of developing and adopting new or amended plans or\ndevelopment regulations governing residential uses. The duration of any moratorium shall be reasonable in light of the specific conditions that warrant imposition of the moratorium and may not exceed the period of time\nnecessary to correct, modify, or resolve such conditions.\n(b) Hearing required. Except in cases of imminent and substantial threat to public health or safety, before adopting a development regulation imposing a development moratorium with a duration of 60 days or any shorter period,\nthe governing board shall hold a legislative hearing and shall publish a notice of the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the area not less than seven days before the date set for the hearing. A development\nmoratorium with a duration of 61 days or longer, and any extension of a moratorium so that the total duration is 61 days or longer, is subject to the notice and hearing requirements of G.S. 160D-601.\n(c) Exempt projects. Absent an imminent threat to public health or safety, a development moratorium adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to any project for which a valid building permit issued pursuant to G.S.\n160D-1108 is outstanding, to any project for which a special use permit application has been accepted as complete, to development set forth in a site-specific or phased vesting plan approved pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1, to\ndevelopment for which substantial expenditures have already been made in good-faith reliance on a prior valid development approval, or to preliminary or final subdivision plats that have been accepted for review by the local\ngovernment prior to the call for a hearing to adopt the moratorium. Any preliminary subdivision plat accepted for review by the local government prior to the call for a hearing, if subsequently approved, shall be allowed to\nproceed to final plat approval without being subject to the moratorium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a complete application for a development approval has been submitted prior to the effective date of a moratorium, G.S.\n160D-108(b) shall be applicable when permit processing resumes.\n(d)\nRequired statements. Any development regulation establishing a development moratorium must include, at the time of adoption, each of the following:\n(1) A statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the moratorium and what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were considered by the local government and why those alternative courses of action were\nnot deemed adequate.\n(2) A statement of the development approvals subject to the moratorium and how a moratorium on those approvals will address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.\n78 of 100\n7/3/2024, 1:25 PM\n"}, {"page": "79", "text": "Granville County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(3) A date for termination of the moratorium and a statement setting forth why that duration is reasonably necessary to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.\n(4) A statement of the actions, and the schedule for those actions, proposed to be taken by the local government during the duration of the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the\nmoratorium.\n(e) Limit on renewal or extension. No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any additional period unless the local government shall have taken all reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken in its\nordinance establishing the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and conditions warrant an extension. Any ordinance renewing or extending a\ndevelopment moratorium must include, at the time of adoption, the findings set forth in subdivisions (1) through (4) of subsection (d) of this section, including what new facts or conditions warrant the extension.\n(f)\nExpedited judicial review. Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development approvals required by law may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the\nmoratorium. Actions brought pursuant to this section shall be scheduled for expedited hearing, and subsequent proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority by the trial and appellate courts. In such actions, the local\ngovernment shall have the burden of showing compliance with the procedural requirements of this subsection.\n(Amend. of 4-19-2021(2), \u00a7 1)\nSecs. 32-1087-32-1100 Reserved.\nDIVISION 4.

Additional procedures apply to watershed variances as set out in section 32-1084.\n(b) When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, the board of adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the chapter upon a showing of all of the following:\n(1)\nUnnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the chapter. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\n(2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are\ncommon to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair\nHousing Act for a person with a disability.\n(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be\nregarded as a self-created hardship.\n(4) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the chapter, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\n(c) No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.\n(Ord. of 7-12-1999, \u00a7 21.330; Amend. of 10-21-2013, \u00a7 9; Amend. of 4-19-2021(2), 1)\nSec. 32-1104.
