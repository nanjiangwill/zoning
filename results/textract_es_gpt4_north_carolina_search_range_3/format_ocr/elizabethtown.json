This district is\ncustomarily located at the intersection of one or more highways or along thoroughfares.

For example, a large tract may be developed with\na mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to commercial\nand office uses. A Conditional district allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such\nas lot sizes and setbacks) upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development.\nThe district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the\nuses identified in Section 6.6 Table of Uses and Activities. All of the site specific standards and\nconditions, including a site plan, are incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the\nConditional District. Approval of the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject\nproperty. A Conditional district shall not be less than three (3) acres in area.\nThis negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations\nto a particular site and project. But is also has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts\non individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning\nis supposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on Conditional zoning.\nConditional Zoning Districts may only occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without\nthe owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards that can be\nimposed are limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town\nordinances and adopted plans and to those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be\ngenerated by use of the site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining reasonable\nspot zoning are fully considered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\nSpecial zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the\ninterest of the landowner, the neighbors, and the public. The town may use a Conditional\nzoning district when it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the\nstandards in the comparable\nSeptember 4, 2018, Updated June 2021\nPage 6-6\nArticle 6\n"}, {"page": "90", "text": "ARTICLE 6.

The Elizabethtown Town Council does hereby find and declare the outdoor placement of\nsigns to be a legitimate use of private property but that the erection of signs should be controlled\nand regulated in order to promote the health, safety, welfare and convenience and enjoyment of\ntravel on and protection of the public investment in streets and roads in Elizabethtown and to\npromote the reasonable, orderly and effective display of such signs, displays and devices. Signs\nmay obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems\nthat legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this section is to regulate the size, color,\nillumination, movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private\nproperty for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character\nof the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community,\nprotection against encroachment on public rights-of-way, and encouraging economic development.\nThis article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality\nin the design, location, size, and purpose of all signs. This article must be interpreted in a manner\nconsistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this article is\nfound by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding must not affect the validity\nof other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision.\n10.20.2. A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or\ndirecting persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and\nsubordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to\nestablish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use\nto which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their, intended purpose while balancing the\nindividual and community interests identified in subsection 10.20.1 of this section.\n10.20.3. These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the\nproperty to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are\nlegible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and\nare constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.\nSeptember 4, 2018, Updated June 2021\nPage 10-22\nArticle 10\n"}, {"page": "225", "text": "ARTICLE 10.
