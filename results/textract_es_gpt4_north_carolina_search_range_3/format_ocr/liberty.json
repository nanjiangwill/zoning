The following rules shall apply with regard to\ndetermination of required yards on lots.\n(1) Yards adjacent to streets shall be front yards. Required yards adjacent to streets shall be measured as follows.\n(a) A straight line shall be drawn between the two points at which lot lines for the portion of the lot line involved\nintersect the street line. Where property corners are rounded, such points shall be plotted by projecting the lot lines to the\npoint where they would have met without rounding.\n(b) Depth or width of required yards adjacent to streets shall be as prescribed in district regulations and measured\nperpendicular to such straight lines.\n(c) The inner line of such required yards shall be parallel to the outer line\n(2) Front yards on interior lots. Front yards on interior lots shall be construed as extending between side lot lines across\nthe front of the lot.\n(3) Front yards on corner lots. Front yards on corner lots shall be construed as extending across all the front of the lot\nfrom each interior side lot line to the opposite street line (parallel to the street lot lines and equal to the distance from the\nstreet lot line prescribed in the district regulations for front yards.)\n(4) Side yards. Side yards shall be construed as running from the rear line of the required front yard to the front line of\nthe required rear yard, if required or, if no rear yard is required, to the opposite lot line. The width of a required side yard\nshall be measured perpendicular to the side lot line and the inner line of the required yard shall be parallel to the outer line,\nat the minimum distance therefrom prescribed in district regulations.\n(5) Side yards on through lots with more than one front yard. Side yards on through lots with more than 1 front yard\nshall be construed as running to the rear lines of the front yards involved, and measurements and requirements shall be as\nfor division (E)(4) above.\n(6) Side yards on corner lots. On corner lots, the side yard is the yard along any lot line which intersects with a street lot\nline. When a corner lot has four sides, the two sides not adjacent to the streets are both side yards and the lot has no rear\nyard. If the corner lot has more than four sides, the yards along lot lines which do not intersect with a street lot line shall be\nconsidered rear yards.\n(7) Rear yards. Rear yards shall be construed as extending across the full width of the lot at its rear. The width of a\nrequired rear yard shall be measured perpendicular to the rear lot line and the inner line of the required yard shall be parallel\nto the outer line, at the minimum distance therefrom prescribed in district regulations. On through lots providing two front\nyards, and on corner lots with four sides, there will be no required rear yard, and yards other than those adjacent to streets\nshall be construed as side yards. If a corner lot has more than four sides, the yards along lot lines which do not intersect with\na street lot line shall be considered rear yards.\n(8) Yards abutting railroad tracks. No yard shall be required along the side or rear of a non-residential lot where the\nside or rear respectively of the lot abuts a track which is or will be used to provide railroad service to the lot.\n(F) Special yards.\n(1) A special yard, for the purposes of these regulations, shall be construed as a yard other than adjacent to a street,\nrequired to perform the same functions as a side or rear yard, but adjacent to a lot line so placed or oriented that neither the\nterm side yard nor the term rear yard, as generally determined defined, or applied with respect to regular lots, fits the\ncircumstances of the case.\n(2) In those instances, the special yard shall be considered a rear yard unless the Zoning Administrator determines that\nside yard requirements of the district shall apply because of the relationship of the portion of the lot on which the yard is to\nbe located to the adjoining lot or lots, with due regard to the orientation of structures and buildable areas thereon.\n(G) Diagram; yards.

For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or\nrequires a different meaning.\nBUFFER. A strip of land together with plantings required thereon. BUFFERS consist of a horizontal distance from a lot\nline which may only be occupied by the required landscaping materials, underground utilities, retention areas, screening\nmaterials and driveway/sidewalk access.\nSCREEN. A strip of land together with plantings and or walls or fences required thereon. Screens consist of a minimum\nof horizontal distance from a lot line which may only be occupied by the required screening materials, additional landscaping\nmaterials, underground utilities and driveway/sidewalk access.\n(C) Buffer or screen required.\n(1) To provide maximum flexibility in achieving a high standard of development both buffer and screen requirements\nare established.\n(2) The developer may choose which protection method is appropriate for the proposed development or he or she may\nmix methods within the development.\n(3) The matrix below indicates when established uses will be required to install a buffer or a screen. In addition the\nmatrix establishes what category of buffer or screen will be required.\n(4) The required buffering or screening between the proposed land use(s) and the existing adjacent land use(s) on\nadjoining zoning lots is set forth in the matrix below.\n(5) Buffers or screens are not required to separate uses located across public streets, however front yard landscaping\nas required by \u00a7 154.086 below shall be installed adjacent to street rights-of-way.\n"}, {"page": "52", "text": "(6) If the land next to the proposed development is vacant, the category required shall be determined by the existing\nzoning on the adjacent vacant parcel.\n(7) If the adjacent parcel is vacant, but is zoned for a more intensive zoning district, no buffer or screen shall be\nrequired of the less intensive use.\n(8) If the adjacent parcel(s) is located within the same zoning district, and the use is classified as a nonconforming use\nin that district, no buffer or screen shall be required of the proposed use.\n(9) If the adjacent parcel is developed in a more intensive manner, no buffer or screen is required of the lesser\nintensive use.

This section is intended to provide the opportunity for solar energy to serve as a viable form of energy\ngeneration while protecting public health, safety and general welfare. These regulations are particularly intended to ensure\nthe compatibility of these facilities with the low intensity residential character of the R40 Residential Zoning District.\n(B) General requirements. A solar farm located in a R40 district shall be subject to the following requirements:\n(1) All structures, parking, storage, solar collectors, inverters, transformers and any other accessory or related\nequipment associated with solar farms shall observe a minimum of a 50 foot wide setback, as measured from lot, parcel or\nlease boundary lines. The setback shall not be used for any other use except for pedestrian or vehicular access to the\nproperty or adjoining property and screening as required below.\n(2) The landscaping requirements in \u00a7 154.086 of this chapter are replaced by the screening requirements in division\n(3) below.\n(3) The buffer and screen requirements in 154.082 of this chapter are replaced by the screening requirements in\ndivision (4) below.\n(4) The setback as described in division (1) above shall serve as the required area to screen the solar farm. The\nscreening shall consist of and be regulated as:\n(a) A row of evergreen shrubs placed not more than five feet apart on center which will grow to form a continuous\nopaque hedge a minimum of six feet in height above finished grade within two years from planting. A berm with an minimum\nheight of three feet above finished grade, as measured from the exterior side of the berm, may be utilized to assist in\nachieving the minimum planting height of six feet;\n(b) A staggered row of evergreen trees, which are not less than six feet in height at the time of planting and are\nspaced not more than 15 feet apart which at maturity will form an intermittent visual barrier from above the opaque hedge to\na minimum height of 20 feet; and\n(c) Lawn and or low-growing evergreen shrubs, evergreen ground cover or mulch covering the balance of the\nscreening yard.\n(d) All plant materials shall be selected which are appropriate to soil and site conditions. It is recommended that\nspecies be selected which are resistant to heat, draught, insects and diseases and which require little maintenance.\nSelected plant materials shall meet the requirements and be installed according to ANLA (American Nursery and Landscape\nAssociation) standards.\n(e) The required screen shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending along the lot, parcel or\nlease boundary lines and shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or other\nexisting or dedicated public rights-of-way. No landscaping shall be permitted which interferes with the sight distance required\nat any roadway or driveway intersection.\n(f) In lieu of this screen an applicant may propose a 50 foot wide buffer consisting of existing mature vegetation. The\napplicant shall provide documentation that the existing vegetation proposed to serve as an alternative buffer provides a\ndegree of opacity, compatibility, and protection to adjoining properties that is equal to or greater than the requirements set\nforth above. Additional evergreen plantings shall be incorporated into this alternative buffer as necessary to achieve this\nintent. The required site plan shall indicate any areas proposed for an alternative buffer.\n(5) Electric solar energy components shall have a UL listing and be designed with anti-reflective coating(s).\n(6) Solar collection devices shall be designed and located to avoid glare or reflection onto adjacent properties and\nadjacent roadways and shall not interfere with traffic or create a safety hazard to aircraft.\n(7) Solar devices within a solar farm must be enclosed by a fence at least six feet in height and must have clearly\nvisible warning signage concerning voltage.\n(8) An emergency shut-off mechanism is required and notice of its location shall be submitted to Randolph County\nEmergency Management and the Town of Liberty. The mechanism shall be clearly identified and unobstructed and shall be\nnoted clearly on the site plan.\n(9) No business signs, billboards, or other advertising shall be installed on the property, any fence or a solar device.\n(10) The property owner shall have six months to complete decommissioning of the solar facility if no electricity is\ngenerated for a continuous period of 12 months. A project is properly decommissioned when all structures and equipment\nare removed and the site is re-vegetated. Applicant must submit decommissioning plans that describe the anticipated life of\nthe solar project, the party responsible for decommissioning, the estimated decommissioning costs in current dollars, and\nthe method for ensuring that funds will be available for decommissioning and restoration.\n(11) The applicant shall be required to provide written documentation stating that the facility is in compliance with all\napplicable Federal and state regulations.\n(12) No burning shall be utilized in the clearing or development of the site.\n"}, {"page": "110", "text": "(Ord. passed 7-6-2015; Am.
