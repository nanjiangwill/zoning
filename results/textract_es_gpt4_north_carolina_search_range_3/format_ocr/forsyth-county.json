draft version of the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Unified Development Ordinances (or \"UDO\").\nIt replaces the community's prior Unified Development Ordinances document, which was a compilation of regulations\nthat affect land use, including the Definitions Ordinance, the Zoning Ordinance, the Environmental Ordinance, and\nthe Subdivision Regulations. This UDO reorganizes the material in the prior Unified Development Ordinances\ndocument into a new 10-chapter structure, but does not make any substantive changes to the regulations.\nThe standards in this document are applied to land and development within Forsyth County and the City of Winston-\nSalem. Other incorporated areas in Forsyth County who control their own zoning jurisdictions have adopted their own\nUnified Development Ordinances.\nThis UDO document contains the rules that control how land can be used in the City and the County, what kinds of\nuses may be located in particular locations, and how new development must be configured. The following paragraphs\nexplain some of the attributes of this document.\nThis UDO document is prepared in accordance with the direction and recommendations found in the UDO ClearCode\nCode Assessment document prepared by the City-County Planning Department in 2018 and 2019. This UDO\ndocument shall remain in draft form until it is adopted by the Winston-Salem City Council and Forsyth County Board\nof Commissioners in accordance with State law.\nThis UDO document contains 12 chapters that consolidate similar kinds of provisions, like procedures, zoning districts,\nuse standards, or development standards into individual chapters. Each chapter starts with a table of contents that\nlists the major sections within the chapter.\nThis draft document includes a text formatting system comprised of numbered section and subsection headings that\nare designed to help code users understand how the text in the document is organized. Section headings include\ndifferent color backgrounds and subsection headings use underlining to help them be more visible and easier to\nnavigate.\nAny difference between rules applicable to land in Forsyth County or land in the City of Winston-Salem is indicated\nby different type styles. Text in italics indicates rules solely applicable to land in the City of Winston-Salem. Text that\nis underlined indicates rules solely applicable to land in Forsyth County. The footer of each page describes this\ndistinction for quick reference.\nThe top of almost every page includes a listing of the particular chapter number and name, as well as the appropriate\nsection number and name of the text on that particular page. Page numbers are included at the bottom of each page\nand include the chapter number. Bold text in a grey background is a dynamic cross reference to another portion\nof this Ordinance. Clicking on the cross reference will advance the code user to the cross referenced text.\nIn addition to the text layout and formatting improvements, the draft UDO will be supplemented with graphics and\nillustrations. Graphics are not prepared and inserted until the later stages of the project after the draft text has been\ncompleted.\nThe front of the UDO document includes a glossary of key terms and concepts so that users may quickly find the\nportion of the desired regulations. In addition to the glossary, the digital version of this document is fully searchable.\nThere is also a summary table of abbreviations used in the UDO document.\nWe hope you are able to find the information you need and find this document useable.

The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited\nto,\nany of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a site\nplan, a preliminary or general development plan, a special use permit, a conditional zoning, or any\nother development approval as may be used by a local government. Unless otherwise expressly\nprovided by the local government, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site;\nsignificant topographical and other natural features affecting development of the site; the\napproximate location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other improvements; the\napproximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and other structures; and the\napproximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer,\nroads, and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan shall be defined by the\nrelevant development regulation, and the development approval that triggers vesting shall be so\nidentified at the time of its approval. At a minimum, the regulation shall designate a vesting point\nearlier than the issuance of a building permit. In the event a local government fails to adopt\na\nregulation setting forth what constitutes a site-specific vesting plan, any development approval shall\nbe considered to be a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a site-specific vesting\nplan and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall\nnot confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other\ndocument fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified\nparcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\nd.\nPROCESS FOR APPROVAL AND AMENDMENT OF SITE-SPECIFIC VESTING PLANS\nIf a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by a local development regulation, the\nlocal government shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval.\nIf the duration of the underlying approval is less than two (2) years, that shall not affect the duration\nof the site-specific vesting plan established under this provision. If the site-specific vesting plan is not\nbased on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-602 shall be\nheld. A local government may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon such terms and conditions\nas may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional\napproval shall result in a vested right, although failure to abide by its terms and conditions will result\nin a forfeiture of vested rights. A local government shall not require a landowner to waive vested\nrights as a condition of developmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed\napproved upon the effective date of the local government's decision approving the plan or such\nother date as determined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting\nplan and its conditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the local government\nas follows:\ni.\nAny substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the\noriginal approval.\nii.\nMinor modifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and authorized by local\nregulation.\n3.

If they comply with the Salem Lake Watershed Protection provisions, the applicant can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, their property. Merely proving that the\nvariance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered\nadequate to justify the Board in granting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether\nthe variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of these standards that will make\npossible the reasonable use of property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from the application of these standards to the property rather than from\nother factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3.

PURPOSE\n1. The purpose of the Planned Residential Development (PRD) is to encourage the development of\nenvironments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for preplanning and design\nconsiderations.\n2. PRDs provide an alternative to conventional subdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation\nof viable, connected open space and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs.\n3. The PRD provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts.\n4. Three (3) distinct types of open space shall be required in PRDs: (1) active open space, (2) passive open space,\nand (3) thoroughfare open space.\n5. In return for development flexibility, additional site plan information may be required of the developer to\nassist in evaluating the suitability of proposed PRDs.\n6. PRDs are suitable for Growth Management Areas (GMAs) 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n7. The character of a PRD should be appropriate to the GMA in which the PRD is located along the urban to\nrural continuum.\n8. While maximum open space preservation is the primary goal of rural PRDs, open space within urban and\nsuburban PRDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for integration with\nsurrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with adjacent and internal land uses.\nB. MINIMUM SIZE\n1. A PRD shall be located on a site containing at least five (5) contiguous acres in GMA 5.\n2. No minimum size requirement exists for PRDs in GMA 2, GMA 3, and GMA 4.\nC. SKETCH PLAN REVIEW\n1. Prior to the formal submission of a proposed PRD, the petitioner or their representative shall attend an\ninterdepartmental Sketch Plan Review Meeting. The petitioner shall be required to produce a scaled sketch site\nplan showing the existing cultural, historic, and physical features of the site for review by the Interdepartmental\nReview Committee. Staff may ask for additional information, such as the location of prime agricultural soils,\nhistorical structures, archeological/cultural elements, the depth of viewshed as seen from existing public rights-\nof-way, the location of rock walls and other \"unique\" features on site, and the location and general specifications\nof any proposed septic systems. The location and design of the proposed open space types shall also be included\nfor review including how the active open space areas are to be activated.\nD. PERMITTED PRINCIPAL USES\nPRDs may include all uses permitted within the underlying zoning district.\nE.

Provisions\nSection 8.1 Floodway and Floodway Fringe Regulations\n8.1\nFLOODWAY AND FLOODWAY FRINGE REGULATIONS\n8.1.1 GENERAL\nA. FINDINGS OF FACT\n1. The flood-prone areas within the jurisdictions of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and\ngovernmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the\ntax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in\nflood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other\nhazards.\nB. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of these standards to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public\nand private losses due to flood conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:\n1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards\nor that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood\ndamage at the time of initial construction;\n3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are\ninvolved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may\nincrease flood hazards to other lands.\nC. OBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of these standards are to:\n1. Protect human life, safety, and health;\n2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the\nexpense of the general public;\n4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and\nsewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood-prone areas;\n6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas; and\n7. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.\nD. LANDS TO WHICH THESE STANDARDS APPLY\nThese standards shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of Forsyth County and within\nthe jurisdiction of any other community whose governing body agrees, by resolution, to such applicability.\nE. BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS\n1. The special flood hazard areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) Agreement\nbetween the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and its accompanying Flood\nInsurance Rate Maps (FIRM), for Forsyth County dated January 2, 2009, which are adopted by reference and\ndeclared to be a part of this Ordinance.\n2. The initial Flood Insurance Rate Maps are as follows for the jurisdictional areas at the initial date:\na.\nForsyth County Unincorporated Area, dated September 1, 1972;\nCELL (1, 1): \nWINSTON-SALEM/FORSYTH COUNTY UDO\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST UPDATED: 10.5.23\nCELL (2, 1): \nItalics text: Applicable in Winston-Salem only\nCELL (2, 2): \n8-4\nCELL (2, 3): \nUnderlined text: Applicable in Forsyth County only\n"}, {"page": "586", "text": "Chapter 8 Environmental Provisions\nSection 8.1 Floodway and Floodway Fringe Regulations\nF.

COMPLIANCE\nNo structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, altered, or developed in any way without\nfull compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations.\nH. ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS\n1. This Ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed\nrestrictions.\n2. However, where this Ordinance and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent\nrestrictions shall prevail.\nI. INTERPRETATION\nIn the interpretation and application of these standards, all provisions shall be:\n1. Considered as minimum requirements;\n2. Liberally construed in favor of the Elected Body; and\n3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.\nJ. WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\nThe degree of flood protection required by these standards is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and\nis based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may\nbe increased by man-made or natural causes. These standards do not imply that land outside the special flood\nhazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These standards\nshall not create liability on the part of Forsyth County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages\nthat result from reliance on these standards or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.\nK.

INTENT\n1.\nThese standards are intended to provide the City-County Planning Board, and all other local elected\nand appointed boards within Forsyth County the information necessary to make informed decisions\nregarding planned development impacts to traffic on their roads.\n2.\nBy adopting these standards the City-County Planning Board seeks to ensure that:\na.\nAll decisions regarding traffic impacts due to development are based upon technical study, and\nb. Needed improvements are made in a cost effective and efficient manner.\nB. APPLICABILITY\n1. City-County Planning Board (CCPB) staff, the Winston-Salem Department of Transportation (WSDOT)\nand/or the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) review proposed development plans for\ntraffic impacts. WSDOT and/or NCDOT have the ultimate responsibility for resolving questions concerning\ntraffic impact studies. These agencies may recommend that a traffic impact study be performed for any\nproposed development that meets the trip generation threshold of this ordinance.\n2. Anyone performing a traffic impact study in Forsyth County shall contact WSDOT and/or NCDOT to determine\nthe traffic concerns of each jurisdiction or to request a pre-study conference.\n3.\nThese standards are intended to provide structure for the traffic study preparer. Individual study\nrecommendations will be determined on a case by case basis.\n4.\nAll traffic impact studies should conform to sound engineering principles and are subject to review by WSDOT\nand/or NCDOT. The study should be submitted electronically to the Planning Department, the Winston-Salem\nDepartment of Transportation and NCDOT Division 9.\n5.\nAll methods used for analysis other than those mentioned in these standards shall be explained, and their\nlimitations described in an appendix to the traffic impact study.\nC. BASIS FOR REQUESTING A TIS\n1. A traffic impact study shall be required according to any of the following:\na. Any proposed Special Use District Rezoning, Planning Board Review, or subdivision that will increase\nthe approach traffic volumes at intersections or roadways by 150 or more vehicles in the peak hour.\nb. Proposed development in the vicinity of areas previously identified as having levels of service \"E\" or\n\"F\", hazardous locations, or other similar adequacy concerns.\nC.\nWhere a reduction in safety is expected at intersections or roadways. A traffic signal warrant study\nmay still be requested by NCDOT or WSDOT even if a traffic impact study is not.\nd.\nWhere a proposed development has been approved by the City-County Planning Board or any\nelected board in Forsyth County based on recommendation from an acceptable traffic impact study\nand that project has not been completed within two (2) years of the date of approval, an updated\ntraffic impact study may be required. If changes are made to the pre-approved site plan that will\nrequire a new approval from the City-County Planning Board or other elected, a new and/or updated\ntraffic impact study may be required.\nThis recommendation may be waived by the Director of WSDOT and/or the Division Engineer of\nNCDOT Division 9 upon written request by the petitioner upon adequate justification for such waiver.\nCELL (1, 1): \nWINSTON-SALEM/FORSYTH COUNTY UDO\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST UPDATED: 10.5.23\nCELL (2, 1): \nItalics text: Applicable in Winston-Salem only\nCELL (2, 2): \n12-3\nCELL (2, 3): \nUnderlined text: Applicable in Forsyth County only\n"}, {"page": "787", "text": "Chapter 12 Appendix\nSection 12.2 Traffic Impact Study Standards\nD. STANDARDS FOR REVIEW\n1. A Traffic Impact Study shall only be performed by a Professional Engineer licensed by the North Carolina\nBoard of Registration for Engineers and Land Surveyors, to practice engineering in North Carolina, with\nexperience in the preparation of traffic impact studies.\n2. The following areas of investigation shall generally be included in a Traffic Impact Study:\na. An examination of traffic flows, exclusive of the site being studied, defined as \"background traffic\";\nb. An examination of projected traffic flows when site traffic is added, defined as \"total traffic\";\nC.\nA discussion of mitigation measures (if such measures are recommended);\nd. An examination of projected traffic flows after the site is developed and mitigation measures are\nimplemented.\n3. Traffic shall be examined as follows:\na.\nFrom data collected by persons or agencies within the defined study area which is no more than two\nyears old at the time of study preparation;\nb. From traffic counts obtained by the applicant based on the specification established at the pre-study\nconference.\n4. The study area shall be determined as follows:\nThe study area should include each intersection with a major thoroughfare highway which can be\nconsidered as a logical travel path between the site and the major thoroughfare highway network.\nMajor thoroughfare highways are so designated by the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Thoroughfare\n(or Transportation) Plan. The study area(s) should be reviewed and approved by WSDOT or NCDOT\nprior to preparing the study.\nAdditional intersections between the site and the major thoroughfare intersection(s) as well as those\nintersections that are rationally identified as being impacted by a development shall be included in\nthe study area.\n5. The design hour shall be determined by:\na. The period for the proposed development which will generate the highest traffic volumes; and/or\nb. The period of highest traffic volumes on the traffic facilities within the study area.\n6.\nThe forecast year shall be determined according to some or all of following criteria:\na. A scheduled phase or the completion of the project (for this and other projects);\nb. The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan;\nC.\nLocally adopted Transportation or Thoroughfare plan or capital improvement program schedule, or\nTransportation Improvement Program;\nd. Major transportation system changes.\n7. The following technical procedures and guidelines shall be used:\nRoadways and intersections shall be analyzed using the appropriate analysis method as depicted in\nthe latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual, Transportation Research Board. Additional\nanalyses may be recommended depending on the traffic concerns expressed at the pre-study\nconference.\n8.\nThe minimum standard for traffic operations is defined as follows:\nLevel of service \"D\" is the lowest level of service that should be considered adequate for intersections\nand roadway approaches to intersections in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County.

By historic and/or projected traffic increase rates on roads classified as being major thoroughfares\n(arterial or major collectors); and\nb. By developments/trips that have been approved (recorded) on roads classified as minor\nthoroughfares or streets (minor collectors or local roads).\n10. Trip Generation, Distribution and Assignment shall be determined using the following:\na. The latest edition of the Trip Generation Manual, Institute of Transportation Engineers; or\nb. Documented local trip generation rates, (as determined through previous or current studies).\nTrip distribution shall be determined by using the following:\nC. Gravity model;\nd. Trip assignment of the traffic demand forecasting model;\ne. Utilization of demographic data leading to trip purpose and trip tables;\nf.\nCurrent directional distribution only if no future changes to land use and no improvements to\ntransportation facilities are expected until the design year;\ng. Trips should be assigned to the study area network during the study's design hour.\n11. Pass-by Trips shall be determined by using either of the following:\na. The Institute of Transportation Engineers pass-by trip rates; or\nb. Documented local pass-by trip rates, (as determined through previous or current studies).\n12. Traffic shall be apportioned to the proposed project in the following manner:\na. First, the projected level of service for the study area is forecast without the proposed project.\nb. Second, the projected level of service is forecast with the addition of the proposed project.\nThe two forecasts shall be evaluated to determine whether the traffic projected to be generated by the\nproposed development will lower the projected Levels of Service (LOS) within the study area to below\nLOS \"D\" or one level below the current level of service.\n13. When a traffic impact study projects that the intersection(s) or roadway(s) in the study area will\nmeet\nthe level of service standard and other identified recommendations have been addressed, Planning staff shall\nmake no further traffic impact recommendations. However, it is possible that the NCDOT Division Engineer\nor the Winston-Salem Department of Transportation may still recommend additional analyses and/or\nimprovements.\n14. When a traffic impact study projects that the intersection(s) or roadway(s) in the study area will be inadequate\nthen the following alternatives may be considered:\na. The project is deferred or reduced in scope so that the level of service standard is not exceeded, or\nb. A mitigation plan is submitted for review by Planning, WSDOT and/or NCDOT staff. The mitigation\nplan together with the recommendations of staff are presented to the Planning Board and elected\nbody, where required.\ni. A mitigation plan is:\n1.\nAn addition to a traffic impact study, (the recommendation for which is identified by\npreliminary study results);\n2.\nIntended to identify specific causes of lowered levels of service (traffic impacts);\n3.\nRecommends improvements that will moderate the effects of projected traffic impacts;\n4.
