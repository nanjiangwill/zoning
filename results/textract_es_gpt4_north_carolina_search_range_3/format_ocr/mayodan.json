The principal uses\nin this district will be single-family residences and agriculture. However, other uses will also be\nallowed if they are compatible with these principle uses.\nR-12 Residential District - The intent of the R-12 District is to establish a medium density\ndevelopment pattern inside the town limit where municipal water and sewer systems are\navailable.

The\nprinciple uses include not only single-family, two-family, and multifamily uses but other\ncompatible uses. This district shall provide a buffer between the more restricted R-12 District\nand the C-1 and C-2 Commercial Districts.\nC-1 Central-Commercial District - The intent of the C-1 District is to preserve the town's\ncentrally located trade and commercial area. Because of its unified development pattern, uses\nwill not provide the dimensional requirements imposed on commercial development allowed the\nthoroughfares of the community.\nC-2 Highway Commercial District - The intent is to provide commercial areas along the major,\nroadways to serve the needs of the residents as well as those living elsewhere for goods and\nservices. Because many of these uses may interfere with residential uses, the community will\nattempt to separate commercial from residential uses or at least provide buffers that will help\nmitigate some of these negative impacts.\nC-3 Neighborhood Commercial District - The intent is to provide commercial areas adjacent to\nresidential zones that are more compatible than C-2 Commercial Districts use. Unlike the other\ncommercial district, only activities that produce limited vehicular traffic, noise, or smoke will be\nallowed.\nM-1 Industrial District - The intent is to provide areas within the planning jurisdiction sites for\nmanufacturing, warehousing, processing, and related uses whose operating characteristics limit\ntheir effects on adjacent use.\nR-20: Residential Low-Density R-12: Residential Medium-Density R-6: Residential Low-Density\nC-1 Central Commercial | C-2 Highway Commercial | C-3 Neighborhood Commercial\nM-1 Industrial | F-P Floodplain See PRD-22 for allowed uses in Rivers Edge Subdivision\n4 - 2\n"}, {"page": "10", "text": "ARTICLE IV, SECTION 1 - TABLE OF PERMITTED USES\nF-P Floodplain District - The intent is to establish to meet the needs of the Mayo River to carry\nabnormal flows of water in time of flood; to prevent encroachments into the district which will\nunduly increase flood heights and damage; and to prevent the loss of life and excessive damage\nto property in the area of greatest flood hazard.\nSection 5 - Conditional Zoning\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by all owners of the\nproperty to be included.

Generally, where wells and septic tank systems are utilized, each lot shall contain at least 20,000\nsq. ft. Where public water or a sewer system is available, the minimum lot size can be reduced to\n15,000 sq. ft. However, the Rockingham County Health Department shall have the final authority\nto determine lot size based on soil conditions.\n2. The front yard setback is measured from the edge of the right of way and the front edge of the\nbuilding line. The side and rear setbacks are measured from the principal building to the property\nline.\n3. The side yard shall be increased to 15 feet from the edge of the right of way where the lot abuts a\nstreet (where the right-of-way line is unclear, the side yard can be determined by measuring 45\nfeet from the center of the street where a 60-foot right of way exists).\n4. DU - Dwelling Unit\n5. Within the R-12 District, the method of determining lot area for a duplex is calculated by adding\n12,000 sq. ft. for the first DU (dwelling unit) + 6,000 sq. ft. for the second DU or 18,000 sq. ft.\nfor each duplex. Remember, the method of calculation applies to the number of dwelling units\nunder a single or common roof. When a second duplex is added, the calculation starts over again.\nIn this case, each duplex shall have 18,000 sq. ft. of lot area.\n6. Within the R-6 District, the method of calculation is the same as discussed above.. The\ncalculation applies to the number of dwelling units within a common structure. For each\nbuilding, the lot area requirement must be figured separately. Add 6,000 sq. ft. for the first DU +\n3,000 sq. ft. for the second DU on the ground level + 1,500 sq. ft. for each additional DU on the\nsecond floor. For example, in a four unit, two-story apartment building, the lot area will be\n12,000 (6,000 1st DU + 3,000 sq. ft. for the 2nd DU on the ground floor + 1,500 sq. ft. for each\nDU on the second floor).\n7. The method of calculating lot width is 100 ft. for the 1st DU + 25 ft. for the second DU (for a\nduplex 100 ft. + 25 ft. = 125 ft.) Each duplex shall have a 125 ft. lot width at the building line.\n8. The method for calculating lot width is 50 ft. + 5 ft. for each additional DU. For example, a four-\nunit apartment shall have a building width of at least 70 ft. (50 ft. + 5 ft. + 5 ft. + 5 ft. + 5 ft.).\n9. Height of buildings shall not exceed the limits specified in Article V, Section 1, Table of Area,\nHeight and Yard Regulations unless the depth of the front and total width of the side yards\nrequired shall be increased by one foot for each two feet, or fraction, of building height in excess\nof the specified height. Church spires, flag poles and similar accessories, but not antennas, are\nexempt from this height limitation.\n10. Where a lot abuts any residential district, there shall be a side or rear yard of at least 10 ft.\nPage 5 - 2\n"}, {"page": "23", "text": "ARTICLE VI -SPECIAL USES AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSection I Purposes\nThe development and execution of this ordinance is based upon the division of the planning area\ninto districts where the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and\nstructures in relation to the land are substantially uniform.
