Subject to high\nstandards of planning and design, certain property uses are allowed in the several districts where\nthose uses would not otherwise be acceptable. By means of controls exercised through the\nspecial use permit procedures, property uses which would otherwise be undesirable in certain\ndistricts, can be developed to minimize any bad effects they might have on surrounding\nproperties.\nThe uses for which special use permits are required are listed in this section,\nalong with a detailed description of the procedures which must be followed in the approval of\neach such permit. Uses specified in this section shall be permitted only upon the issuance of a\nspecial use permit.\n10.2\nProcedure for Special Use Permits Approved by the Board of Adjustment\nA Special Use Permit may be issued by the Zoning Administrator after written approval\nby the Board of Adjustment, for the uses as designated in the table of regulations for Special\nUses. The application for a Special Use Permit shall be accompanied with the appropriate fee.\nThe application for the Special Use Permit shall be filed Twenty (20) business days prior to the\ndate of review by the Board of Adjustment. With the exception of\nSpecial Use Permit requests for the occupancy of individual manufactured homes under\nthe Hardship, Agricultural Areas Exception, of Office and Exhibition provisions of this\nordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing prior to rendering a decision on\nthe written approval/disapproval of a Special Use Permit. There will be a notice of the hearing\nconcerning the special use permit mailed to the person or entity whose application, or request\nis the subject of the hearing. A notice of hearing shall also be mailed to the owner of the property\nthat is subject to the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing and to the owners of the\nall parcels of land abutting the parcel of that is the subject of the hearing. The Board will follow\nthe quasi-judicial process as outlined in G.S. 160D-406 when reviewing special use permit\napplications and will not impose conditions on the special use permits that are not within the\nstatutory authority to impose as stated in G.S. 160D-705(c). The special use permit, if\napproved, shall include approval of such plans as may be required. In approving the permit, the\nBoard of Adjustment shall find:\n(1)\nThat the use will not materially endanger the public health, safety or general\nwelfare if located where proposed and developed according to the plan as\nsubmitted and approved;\n(2)\nThat the use meets all required conditions;\n-93 -\n"}, {"page": "99", "text": "(3)\nThat the use will not adversely affect the use/value or any physical attribute of\nadjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a public necessity; and\n(4)\nThat the location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan as\nsubmitted and approved, will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be\nlocated and in general conformity with the plan of development of the Town of\nGrimesland.\nIn approving the Special Use Permit, the Board of Adjustment may designate such\nconditions, in addition and in connection therewith, as will, in its opinion, assure that the use in\nits proposed location will be harmonious with the area in which it is proposed to be located and\nwith the spirit of this ordinance. All such additional conditions shall be entered in the minutes\nof the meeting at which the Special Use Permit is granted, recorded on the Special Use Permit\nand on the approved plans submitted therewith. All conditions shall run with the land and shall\nbe binding on the original applicant for the Special Use Permit, the heirs, successors and\nassigns.
