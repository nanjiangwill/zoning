Town Character\nThis Article serves to establish a safe environment and coherent character for the Town that\nencourages a high caliber and lasting quality of development. These standards establish a\ncommon design language for nonresidential development. These standards also are intended to\nattach the same or greater level of importance to the overall building design as is placed on the\nuse contained within to facilitate the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious\ncommunity.\nb. Architectural Standards & Design\nThe purpose and intent of the Fuquay-Varina Building Type and Architectural Standards is to\nprovide a method to create better design within the Town. The ultimate design of a building is in\nmany ways an artistic expression and cannot be easily quantified or regulated, however, some\nbasic design features of a building's exterior are essential and will go a long way toward\nimproving the visual interest in a building's appearance from the street and adjacent properties.\nC. Design Principles & Objectives\nThe objective of these standards is to articulate clear community design principles that assist\narchitects and engineers in understanding the Town's minimum architectural design standards,\ncreating higher aesthetic appeal, increasing resale value and providing more stable property\nvalues. These standards do not dictate or limit design or style of a building, as architectural\ndiversity is encouraged, but will encourage more thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing solutions\nto building designs at a minimum.\nd.

Building Features\nMajor building design features, such as but not limited to windows, shutters, vents, doors,\nentrances, awnings, canopies, roofs (pitch/design), leaves, and parapets, shall incorporate the\nfollowing standards:\n(1) Proportional Design. The design of features is in proportion to one another.\n(2)\nArchitectural Style. Buildings shall be architecturally designed such that elements from\ndifferent styles of architecture or time periods are not incongruently utilized on a single\nbuilding or within a single development.\nC. Structural Lines Retained at Street Level\nThese structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the street level, such as\nbrick piers and columns, which shall be carried down to street level.\nd. Awnings & Canopies\nAwnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to which they are\naffixed and other awnings and canopies on the same building.\ne. Massing\nA single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required,\nmassing should be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and\nsimilar design techniques.

The Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District\nis intended primarily to accommodate residents specifically within a reasonable distance (1/4 to\n1/2 mile) of the downtown area. The Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District offers the\nopportunity for a mix of residential uses with some supporting retail and office uses at\ndesignated locations, to complement and enhance a vibrant mix of uses that supports the\nresilience and sustainability of the downtown districts.\n\u00a79-4001 INTENT\nThe intent of the Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District is to allow design flexibility,\nhousing types that offer choices, retail and office and institutional uses for convenience, and to\nincrease recreational opportunities and mobility for pedestrians. The desire to create, integrate,\nencourage and sustain viable opportunities in this district is supported by performance standards\nas follows:\na. Civic Space\nIntroduce civic space in the form of squares or greens that offer activities and\nconnectivity for residents.\nb. Master Plan\nThe Town Center Residential Zoning District requires approval of a master plan in\naccordance with the standards of Article Q Procedures & Administration, 9-1808\nCommon Application Procedures, u. Master Plan. The size and detail included in a\nmaster plan shall be relative to the size of the specific project. For projects resulting in\nfour (4) or less residential or mixed-use lots or parcels, a plot plan shall serve as the\nrequired master plan.\nC. Preservation of Natural Environment\nEnsure that development preserves the natural environment for public use and enjoyment\nas well as provide for the protection of property from flooding or other natural disasters.\n"}, {"page": "862", "text": "d. Public Transportation\nEstablish land use patterns that promote opportunities for public transportation that will\nserve all age groups, disabilities, income and service needs.\ne. Residential Use\nProvide for a variety of single-family residential types with flexibility in lot size\nintroducing, for example cottage homes, row houses on \"shotgun\" lots and secondary\nunits on a single lot. The use of multi-family residential types is designed to be\nappropriately located where office and retail uses would be prominent. A main\ncomponent of a sustainable downtown center is people that live in or in close proximity\nto the downtown. The Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District is a transitional\ndistrict that provides energy and service support for the downtown center. To support this\nenergy the district needs to create a greater variety of housing types and opportunities for\nresidents to live in close proximity to the downtown.\nf. Retail & Office Use\nIntroduce limited and specific retail and offices to serve local residences limited by lot\nsize and building square footage and permit second story apartments.\ng. Vehicle & Pedestrian Mobility\nMaintain mobility by utilizing and expanding upon the existing grid pattern for new\ndevelopment and reconstruction to serve vehicles and pedestrians facilities that are linked\nspecifically to the downtown area, with an efficient and compact network of streets and\nutilities. Permit and encourage alleys as access to residential, office and retail services.\n\u00a79-4002 DISTRICT BOUNDARY\nZoning property to the Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District shall be limited to\nproperties located within, and immediately surrounding the boundary of Judd Parkway as\nidentified on the Community Transportation Plan.
