The NAICS Manual\nclassifies businesses and industries based on common functional or product\ncharacteristics. Functions and characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of\ncustomers and how goods or services are sold or delivered. NAICS is a two- through six-digit\nhierarchical classification system, offering five levels of detail. Each digit in the code is part of a\nseries of progressively narrower categories, and the more digits in the code signify greater\nclassification detail. The first two digits designate the economic sector, the third digit designates\nthe subsector, the fourth digit designates the industry group, the fifth digit designates the NAICS\nindustry, and the sixth digit designates the national industry. The five-digit NAICS code is the level\nat which there is comparability in code and definitions for most of the NAICS sectors across the\nthree countries participating in NAICS (the United States, Canada, and Mexico). The six-digit level\nallows for the United States, Canada, and Mexico each to have country-specific detail. A complete\nand valid NAICS code contains six digits.

One of the most\nobvious is to enhance the appearance of the property and increase the property's value. Other\nbenefits of plants and vegetative buffers in the home and business property landscape are as\nfollows:\n1) Reduce air pollution by absorbing Carbon Dioxide and releasing Oxygen.\n2) Reduce erosion by dispersing and absorbing rainfall.\n3)\nReduce stream pollution by stabilizing soil and slowing, dispersing and absorbing\nstormwater runoff.\n4) Reduce stormwater runoff and the potential for flooding.\n5) As properties provide trees, plants and other landscape vegetation, not only is the\nappearance of individual properties improved, but Community Appearance is enhanced.\nThis provides a substantial value to the community and other properties in the Community.\n6) Buffer and Landscape trees and other plants also help reduce noise from auto traffic, glare\nfrom auto and other lights and help collect & reduce litter from reaching adjacent\nproperties.\nPender County Landscape and Vegetative Buffer Requirements\nThe Pender County Unified Development Ordinance contains requirements for landscaping and\nbuffer plantings for certain types of developments in and adjacent to parking lots containing more\nthan 10 spaces and around the perimeter of the site or developed area of the site.

The list of plants and shrubs included\n(in the list attached) are not the only types of trees and shrubs that may be used to meet the\nrequirements in the Pender County Unified Development Ordinance for landscaping and buffering.\nThe list only provides examples of plants that may be suitable for the locations on sites, where\nlandscaping and plantings are required by the UDO. Many other types, species and varieties of\nplants can be used and are available. Plants for certain types of developments should be chosen\nthat are low maintenance and adaptable to the conditions peculiar to the site. Landscape\nArchitects, local nurseries, plant suppliers, the NC Agricultural Extension Service or other available\nsources should be consulted when making a substantial investment in plant materials and\ninstallation. Buffers and Landscaping required by the UDO must be maintained for the duration of\nany approval issued for the site and use.

When planted in their preferred\nsoil type, these plants are able to withstand extended periods of drought, 4-6 weeks, without\nsupplemental irrigation once established. Most trees and shrubs take two to three growing seasons\nto become fully established. Perennials, grasses and groundcovers usually require one to two\nseasons to become established. Regular supplemental water should be provided until plants\nbecome established.\nMature Size\nMature sizes of all plants are given as height and spread, though it may take many years to reach\nthese dimensions. Mature size can vary depending on growing conditions.\nRecommended Varieties\nFor many plants, recommended varieties are given.
