Purpose\nThe Exceptional Design Zoning District (EDZD) provides opportunities for mixed use and\nhigh density residential projects within the unincorporated areas of the County where\nappropriate urban features are in place to support such projects without the negative\nimpacts of urban sprawl. Through the conservation of water bodies, wetlands, floodplains,\nand open space, it is intended that this district will prevent the degradation of water quality\nand foster the preservation of natural hydrology, habitat, and biodiversity. In addition, the\ndistrict is intended to provide design flexibility to achieve public and private spaces that\nadvance a sense of community in a well-integrated service area that diminishes the need\nfor vehicular traffic and encourages bicycle and pedestrian movements. The EDZD shall\nbe located with respect to public and private facilities existing or clearly available by the time\nthey are required within the development.\nB. Applicability\n1. As of May 3, 2021, no new EDZD district shall be added to the Official Zoning Map,\nnor may any boundary of an existing EDZD district be modified. Any property zoned\nEDZD prior to May 3, 2021 exists as part of the Official Zoning Map and shall conform\nto the standards of this ordinance. [05-03-2021]\n2. EDZD projects must be located on sites suitable for development in the manner\nproposed without creating hazards to persons or property, on or off the district, and\nfree from the probability of flooding, erosion, subsidence, or slipping of the soil or other\ndangers. Condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage and topography shall all be\nappropriate to both the kind and pattern of use intended. If appropriate to the form\nand function of development, lands to be included in EDZD districts may be divided by\nstreets, alleys, rights-of-way, or easements but shall be located, dimensioned, and\narranged as to permit unified planning and development and to meet all requirements\nin connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary protection against adverse\nrelationships between uses in the district and uses in surrounding area.\n3. Areas classified as Rural Residential place type, Conservation place type, AE or VE\nspecial flood hazard areas, or CAMA Estuarine Areas of Environmental Concern are\nnot eligible for residential density greater than 2.5 units per acre, and such acreage,\nwith the exception of area within the Rural Residential place type, must be subtracted\nfrom the acreage upon which density on other portions of the district is calculated. All\nother areas of the unincorporated planning jurisdiction for New Hanover County are\neligible for the EDZD.\n4. A district must include the entirety of the parcel or parcels being considered, and the\napplicant must be the owner or owners of all the property to be included in the district.\nThe applicant must demonstrate that the property is jointly owned or be subject to a\nformal agreement for unified control. Authorization to construct shall not be issued\nuntil unified control is established.\n5.\nA district may not extend across any major or minor arterial roadway having three or\nmore lanes of vehicular traffic unless the district proposed multiple, unified\n3-68\nNew Hanover County, NC I Unified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "135", "text": "C.

The\ngeneral objectives of these standards are to promote the health, safety, welfare,\nconvenience and enjoyment of the public, and in part, to achieve the following:\nA.\nSafety - To promote the safety of persons and property by providing that signs:\n1. Do not create a hazard due to collapse, fire, decay, collision, or\nabandonment;\n2. Do not obstruct fire-fighting or police surveillance; and\n3. Do not create traffic hazards by confusing or distracting motorists, or by\nimpairing the driver's ability to see pedestrians, obstacles, or other\nvehicles, or to read traffic signs.\nB.\nCommunications Efficiency - To promote the efficient transfer of information in sign\nmessages by providing that:\n1. Those signs which provide messages and information most needed and\nsought by the public are given priorities;\n2. Businesses and services may identify themselves;\n3. Customers and other persons may effectively locate a business or service;\n4.

The establishment of a buffer zone is based upon the stated goals in\nPolicies 3.10 and 3.11 of the 1999 Wilmington-New Hanover County\nComprehensive Plan. The buffer zones are intended to promote the\nUnified Development Ordinance I New Hanover County, NC\n5-9\n"}, {"page": "324", "text": "comprehensive plan goals of high water quality in the creeks and sounds,\nto protect the public health, and to ensure the protection of the natural\nresources of New Hanover County.\n2. A properly vegetated buffer is essential to filter and biologically process\nnutrient rich runoff, animal wastes, and sediment before it enters coastal\ncreeks, canals, and rivers. Buffers also function to moderate water\ntemperatures, maintain the desired dissolved oxygen levels in the water,\nand stabilize the soils immediately adjoining the stream. In urban\nenvironments, the function of a buffer is especially critical to the balance of\nthe plant and animal life in fresh and saltwater creeks. Buffers are most\neffective when they contain native and naturalized plants appropriate in\nsize, adaptability (salt tolerance, wind tolerance, etc.) and hardiness for the\narea. Plants requiring intensive or routine maintenance should be avoided\nin buffer areas.\nB.\nApplicability\nThe development and improvement of property, including the subdivision of land,\nshall be subject to the performance controls in this section (5.7.4) if any the following\nconservation resources are associated with the parcel of record for which the\ndevelopment and improvement are proposed:\n1. Salt marsh;\n2. Brackish marsh;\n3. Freshwater marsh; and\n4. Primary nursery area.\nC.\nBuffer Standards\n1. Buffers shall extend 35 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the\nconservation resource and on a line perpendicular to and landward of the\nconversation resource.\n2. The plant material in the buffer zone must be either retained in a natural,\nminimally disturbed condition, or properly managed in accordance with the\nmanagement standards presented in subsection 5 below. In cases where\nvegetation does not exist within the buffer, the County shall require\nrestoration efforts which include, but are not limited to, replanting of the\nbuffer zone with plant species as recommended in the \"Reference Lists\nand Publications for Guidance in the Selection of Vegetated Buffer Plants\".\n3. Development activities within the buffer are limited to water dependent\nstructures, except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 through 6 below,\nand Section 5.7.3.D, Improvements. Examples of water dependent\nstructures include docks, piers, boat ramps, shoreline stabilization,\nnavigation markers and access channels. In order to maintain the\nfunctional value of the buffer, excavation, grading, filing, or ditching is not\npermitted except as otherwise provided herein.\n4. Passive public recreational facilities such as pervious trails and pathways,\nwhere owned by public entities or homeowners associations, may be\npermitted within the buffer.\n5-10\nNew Hanover County, NC I Unified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "325", "text": "5. In order to achieve the County goals to preserve, protect and restore water\nquality and natural resources, the buffer zone shall be vegetated and left in\na natural, undisturbed condition, or managed in accordance with the intent\nof these goals. Management activities compatible with the intent of these\ngoals include, but are not limited to the following:\na. Shoreline Access Paths\nPathways which provide access to the shoreline are permissible\nprovided they are a maximum average of six feet in width and follow a\npath that minimizes erosion within the buffer zone. Pathways may be\nvegetated with grasses and mowed, or may be surfaces such as\ncrushed stone, shell, or mulch. Elevated wooden walkways and stairs\nup to six feet in width may also be used, as long as there is spacing\nbetween boards and elevation of the walkway to provide for light\npenetration and rain water to drip through to allow for continued\nvegetation growth.\nb. View Corridor\nSelective tree removal, thinning, and pruning of natural vegetation\nwithin the buffer zone will be allowed to provide for site lines and vistas\nof the shoreline. Minimal alteration of the natural vegetation is\npreferred.\nC. Safety and Welfare\nSelective tree removal, thinning, and pruning of natural vegetation\nwithin the buffer zone will be allowed at the discretion of the landowner\nfor safety and welfare concerns (e.g. removal of damaged tree in close\nproximity to a dwelling).\nd. Shoreline Erosion Control\nFor necessary shoreline erosion control projects, trees and woody\nvegetation may be removed and the erosion control measure employed\nin a manner which is consistent with the purpose and intent of this\nsection. Areas cleared for erosion control measures may be required to\nbe re-vegetated with plant species as recommended in the \"Reference\nLists and Publications for Guidance in the Selection of Vegetated Buffer\nPlants\".\ne. Habitat and Species Management\nManagement of natural vegetation within the buffer zone to enhance\nwildlife habitat, and control nuisance and non-native species may be\nallowed.\n6. Buffers may be encroached by public roads, bridges, and utilities where no\npractical alternative exists to avoid encroachment.
