However, all planned unit developments shall be located no less than\n20 feet from any adjoining property zoned for residential uses only, unless the use is commercial or industrial in nature in which case the separation must be no less\nthan 100 feet. Such separations shall be accomplished through the use of appropriate screening as detailed in article XIX, section 15-365.\n(1) The residential planned unit development (PUD) is designed to accommodate those uses which would be permissible in one of the City of New Bern's eight\nresidential zoning districts (A-5, R-20, R-15, R-10, R-10A, R-10S, R-8, and R-6). All development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the\nresidential zoning district to which the particular PUD corresponds, except as modified in paragraph (a) of this section.\n(2) The residential/commercial planned unit development (PUD) is designed to accommodate a combination of residential and C-4 commercial uses. Within the\nportion of a PUD that is developed for purposes permissible in a commercial district, all development must be properly screened from adjoining residential\ndevelopments within the PUD in accordance with the standards outlined in article XIX, section 15-365 (Table of screening requirements). All development must\nbe\nin accordance with the regulations applicable to the commercial district in which the particular PUD is to be located. Additionally, no commercial use located\nwithin the residential/commercial PUD may be located within 100 feet of any residential district that is not a part of the PUD.\n(3) The commercial planned unit development (PUD) is designed to accommodate those uses which would be permissible in one of the City of New Bern's six\ncommercial zoning districts (C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-5A). All development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the commercial district in\nwhich the particular PUD zoning district is to be located.\n(4) The commercial/industrial planned unit development (PUD) is designed to accommodate a combination of commercial and light industrial uses. Within the\nportion of the PUD that is developed for purposes permissible in an I-1 industrial district, all development must be properly screened from adjoining commercial\ndevelopment in the PUD in accordance with the standards outlined in article XIX, section 15-365 (Table of screening requirements).\n(5) The industrial planned unit development (PUD) is designed to accommodate those uses which would be permissible in one of the City of New Bern's two\nindustrial zoning districts (I-1 and I-2).

Likewise, within any tract in a commercial zoning district developed as a commercial/industrial\nPUD, not more than ten percent of the total tract area may be developed for purposes that are permissible in an I-1 zoning district.\n(c) The plans for the proposed planned unit development shall indicate the particular portions of the tract that the developer intends to develop for purposes\npermissible in a residential district (as applicable), purposes permissible in a commercial district (as applicable), and purposes permissible only in an industrial district\n(as applicable). For purposes of determining the substantive regulations that apply to the planned unit development, each portion of the tract so designated shall\nthen be treated as if it were a separate district, zoned to permit, respectively, residential, commercial, or industrial uses. However, only one permit (a planned unit\ndevelopment permit) shall be issued for the entire development. Said permit may be issued by the zoning administrator following subdivision general plan approval.\n(d) The nonresidential portions of any planned unit development may not be occupied until all of the residential portions of the development are completed or their\ncompletion is assured by any of the mechanisms provided in article IV to guarantee completion. The purpose and intent of this provision is to ensure that the\nplanned unit development procedure is not used, intentionally or unintentionally, to create nonresidential uses in areas generally zoned for residential uses except\nas\npart of an integrated and well-planned, primarily residential, development.\n50 of 294\n4/22/24, 19:55\n"}, {"page": "51", "text": "New Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The term also includes binding contractual commitments to make\nfuture expenditures, as well as any other substantial changes in position.\n(4)\nNonconforming lot: A lot existing at the effective date of this ordinance that does not meet the minimum area and dimensional requirements of the district in\nwhich the lot is located.\n(5) Nonconforming project: Any structure, development, or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of this ordinance and would be inconsistent with any\nregulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned.\n(6) Nonconforming sign: A sign (see section 15-15 for definition) that, on the effective date of this ordinance, does not conform to one or more of the regulations set\nforth in this ordinance, particularly article XVII (Signs).\n(7) Nonconforming use: A nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable\nto the district in which the property is located. The term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property.\n(8) Nonconforming situation: A situation that occurs when, on the effective date of this ordinance, an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure\ndoes not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming\nsituation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum square footage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the\nrelationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as density and setback requirements) is not in conformity with this ordinance, or because\nland or buildings are used for purposes not permitted by this ordinance.

The latest edition of said map bears the legend:\nThe City\nOf\nNew Bern\nNC\nScale 1\" = 800 ft.\nZONING\nThe map includes a table in its upper lefthand corner, which reflects revision nos. 1-68 caused by ordinances adopted 2/8/83 through 8/1/91.

Nor shall the table\nof permissible uses be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in\nother zoning districts.\n(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts:\n(1) Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the fire prevention\ncode adopted by reference in chapter 30 of the city Code.\n(2) Stockyards, slaughterhouses, rendering plants.\n(3) Use of a travel trailer or recreational vehicle as a residence, temporary or permanent.\n(4)\nThe use of any motor vehicle (as defined in chapter 70 of the city Code), parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold or\nstored, any service is performed, or other business is conducted (as defined in chapter 14 of the city Code), except that the following shall not be prohibited solely\nby this subsection:\n(a) Retail sales of food products and goods manufactured, created, or produced by the seller; and\n(b) Sale of food products on property by persons authorized by or acting on behalf of the city.\nSection 15-150. - Accessory uses.\n(a) The table of permissible uses (section 15-146) classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts. Whenever two activities or uses occur on the\nsame lot and one use (i) constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot, or (ii) is commonly associated with the\nprincipal use and integrally related to it, then that use which meets the criteria enumerated in (i) and (ii) may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may\n102 of 294\n4/22/24, 19:55\n"}, {"page": "103", "text": "New Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nbe carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use, provided that the accessory use is of equal or lesser zoning classification. For\nexample, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and\nwould be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed apart from a residential development, would require a special use\npermit (use classification 6.210).\n(b) For purposes of interpreting subsection (a):\n(1) A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use;\n(2) To be \"commonly associated\" with a principal use means that the association of the accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency to\nestablish a common acceptance of their relatedness.\n(c) Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b), the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they\nsatisfy the general criteria set forth above:\n(1) Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature; except that the repair of automobiles owned by persons who do not reside on the premises, is\nprohibited.\n(2) The renting out of one room within a single-family residence (which one room does not in itself constitute a separate dwelling unit) to not more than one person\nwho is not part of the family that resides in the single-family dwelling.\n(3) Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three days (whether consecutive or not) during any 90-day\nperiod.\n(d) Without limiting the generality of subsections (a) and (b), the following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in\nresidential districts:\n(1) Parking outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than four motor vehicles between the front building line of the principal building and the street on any\nlot used for purposes that fall within the following principal use classifications: 1.100, 1.200, 1.420, or 1.430.\n(2) Parking and storage outside a substantially enclosed structure of any motor home boat or other recreational vehicle between the front building line of the\nprincipal building and the street on which the lot fronts.

No. 16-047, 53, 9-13-16)\nSection 15-152. - Change in use.\n(a) A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:\n(1) The change involves a change from one principal use category to another.\n(2)\nIf the original use is a combination use (27.000) or planned unit development (28.000), the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses\nthat comprise the combination use or planned unit development use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered.\n(3) If the original use is a combination use or planned unit development use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or\nplanned unit development use changes.\n(4) If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a\ncombination use), that business or enterprise moves out, and a different type of enterprise moves in, and is found under the same principal use or combination\nuse category as the previous type of business. For example, if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of the building moves out\nand is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal use classification 2.110. However, if the florist\nshop were replaced by another florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed.\nMoreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use\nsince there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center-combination use) has not\nchanged.\n(b) A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be\ndetermined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless\nthe property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 continuous days or there has been no affirmative attempt or expressed intention on the part of the\nproperty owner to rent, sell, or use the property.\n(c) A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise shall not be regarded as a change in use.\nSection 15-153. - Developments in the C-3 zoning district.\nThe 2.000 and 3.000 classifications in the table of permissible uses are written in very broad terms. However, it is the intention of this ordinance that uses described in those\nclassifications are permissible in an area zoned C-3 only when the particular use is in accordance with the objectives of the C-3 zoning district set forth in section 15-137.\nSection 15-154. - Combination uses.\n(a) When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), at least one of which required a special\nuse permit, then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be a special use permit.\n(b) Subject to subsection (c), when a combination use consists of a residential subdivision (use classification 1.700) and a multifamily development (1.300), the total\n104 of 294\n4/22/24, 19:55\n"}, {"page": "105", "text": "New Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndensity permissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose\nand calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot.\n(c) Notwithstanding subsection 15-182(b) [15-181(b)], whenever (i) a combination use consists of a standard residential subdivision (use classification 1.700) and a\nmultifamily development (1.300), and (ii) the subdivided portion of the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in section 15-181,\nbut that do not exceed an average of 20,000 square feet, then the density of the portion of the tract developed for multifamily purposes may be increased beyond\nthe permissible density calculated in accordance with subsection (b). The increase in density shall be determined as follows:\n(1) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted from each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders\ntotaled.\n(2) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the minimum lot size requirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole\nnumber.\n(3) The product of the calculation in subsection (2) shall yield the number of additional multifamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of the tract\ndeveloped for multifamily purposes.\n(d) When a residential use is combined with a nonresidential use in a commercial district, the lot used for the residential use must have at least the minimum square\nfootage required for the residential use alone.\n(e) When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for the combination use shall be determined by calculating the amount of parking\nrequired for each individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.\n( Ord.

Former \u00a7 15-155 pertained to \"Planned unit developments,\" and was\nderived from Original Code.\nSection 15-156. - More specific use controls.\nWhenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the table of permissible uses (section 15-146), the classification that most closely and most\nspecifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office or clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However, classification 3.130 (physicians and dentist offices and clinics occupying not more than\n10,000 square feet of gross floor area) more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSections 15-157-15-161. - Reserved.\nARTICLE XI. - SUPPLEMENTARY USE REGULATIONS\n105 of 294\n4/22/24, 19:55\n"}, {"page": "106", "text": "New Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nSection 15-162. - Special events.\n(a) In deciding whether a permit for a special event should be denied for any reason specified in article IV, the zoning administrator shall ensure that, if the special event\nis conducted at all:\n(1) The hours of operation allowed shall be compatible with the uses adjacent to the activity.\n(2) The amount of noise generated shall not disrupt the activities of adjacent land uses.\n(3) The applicants shall guarantee that all litter generated by the special event be removed at no expense to the city.\n(4)\nThe zoning administrator shall not grant the permit unless it finds that the parking generated by the event can be accommodated without undue disruption to or\ninterference with the normal flow of traffic or with the right of adjacent and surrounding property owners.\n(b) In cases where it is deemed necessary, the zoning administrator may require the applicant to post a bond to ensure compliance with the conditions of the zoning\npermit.\n(c) If the permit applicant requests the city to provide extraordinary service or equipment, or if the city manager otherwise determines that extraordinary services or\nequipment should be provided for the public health or safety, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee sufficient to reimburse the city for the costs of these\nservices.

This statement of reasonableness may consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical\nconditions, and other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned; (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding\ncommunity; (iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be\npermissible under the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning\nmap amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. 160D-602(b), the board of aldermen statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.\n(c) Single statement permissible.

Historically, Broad Street Corridor, extending from Bern Street on the east to Fort Totten Drive on the west, and Queen Street, extending from\nFirst Street on the west to West Street on the east, have served as the commercial center of New Bern's \"Five Points\" Neighborhood. Originally comprised of\nneighborhood-related businesses that catered to a walk-in trade in a pedestrian-oriented environment, the Broad/Queen Street Corridor eventually developed into a\n\"commercial strip\" corridor that accommodated primarily vehicular-oriented businesses that placed little emphasis on the pedestrian. The result of this transition\nfrom pedestrian-oriented to vehicular-oriented businesses was the creation of a \"cluttered\" landscape and a \"confusing\" pattern of development that lacks any\norganizational structure. The intent of the design guidelines and performance standards outlined in subsection (b) of this section is to provide a series of\ndevelopmental controls designed to create a unified \"image\" streetscape for the Broad/Queen Street Corridor by ensuring a development pattern that is consistent\nwith historic building traditions in the Five Points commercial center and reestablishing a balance between the vehicular and pedestrian environments.\n(b) [Standards.] All developments in this corridor requiring site plan review as outlined in section 15-452 of this article, as well as public improvements, shall comply with\nthe following standards:\nRequired:\n(1) Private developments (new construction).\n(a) Buildings (new construction) shall be located at the front property line of the site, or within ten feet thereof. There is no minimum side yard setback. The rear\nyard setback shall be governed by section 15-187.\n(b) Buildings shall generally be one, two or three stories in height, not to include cornices, parapet walls, towers, or other similar rooftop appurtenances.\n(c) Buildings to be erected in this corridor shall be designed so as to incorporate features and forms that are consistent with older commercial buildings found in\nthe Broad Street/Queen Street Corridor, the Five Points commercial area (i.e., in the vicinity of the intersection of Broad, Queen, and Roundtree Streets), and\nin the downtown commercial district. These new buildings shall be constructed of materials that are consistent with the materials used in the construction of\nthe said older commercial buildings. Typically, a commercial building was oriented to the street and was constructed with a storefront on the first-floor facade\nwith the primary building entrance facing the street. A storefront incorporated large paned windows for the display of merchandise and had a recessed entry,\nusually located in the center of the facade. The storefront was capped by a decorative wooden cornice which included a flat panel for the placement of\n255 of 294\n4/22/24, 19:55\n"}, {"page": "256", "text": "New Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nsignage. The upper stories of the building, if any, had windows that were smaller in dimension and vertical in their orientation. The building was capped by a\nwooden cornice, patterned brickwork, or parapet wall that helped to define the facade and contribute to the building's overall character. (See sketch entitled\n\"Elements of the Facade.\") Wood, brick, or concrete block (both rusticated and smooth) were predominant finish treatments and shall be used on new\nconstruction located in this corridor.

Parking shall be prohibited from the front yard of any principal building and shall be located solely in the side or rear yards of the said building. In\ncases were parking is located on the side of a principal building, a semi-opaque type B planting screen, as defined in section 15-364 of article XIX, along the\npublic sidewalk shall be installed to screen the parking area from the street. The said planting screen shall constitute compliance with a percentage of the\nplanting requirements detailed in article XIX of this ordinance. However, the permit issuing authority may permit deviations from the requirements of article\nXIX in order to accommodate the development patterns promulgated by this section.\n(e) Each development under single ownership shall be limited generally to one driveway access onto Broad Street which shall provide both points of ingress and\negress. In cases where it is deemed by highway authority's traffic engineer and the city that more than one driveway access would provide a more efficient\ncirculation pattern within the development and would promote improved traffic safety on Broad Street and Queen Street, one additional driveway access into\nthe development may be permitted. Shared driveway access between two neighboring developments shall also be recommended as a suitable alternative to\nthe above-mentioned requirement. In such cases, it is recommended that the driveway midpoint be the property line between the two parcels. The driveway\nmust meet standard specifications, and the estimated driveway volume will be the sum of the trip generation rate of both land uses in question.\nWhen two adjacent property owners agree to establish a shared driveway, the city shall grant an incentive bonus.

The intent of these\nprovisions is to recognize that certain neighborhoods in the city's planning jurisdiction were developed prior to the adoption of the land use ordinance and were built to\nstandards that are inconsistent with contemporary land use regulations in terms of lot size, lot coverage, building setback, building height, and architectural expression. In\ncreating the conservation overlay district, the city acknowledges:\n(1) The preservation of neighborhood character is a vital component of the city's identity and promotes a positive image for the community; and\n(2)\nThe promotion and implementation of specifically tailored land use standards reduces conflicts between new construction and existing development and aids in\nstabilizing and improving property values.\n(Ord.

The subject district is more particularly described as follows:\nBEGINNING AT A POINT in the centerline of First Street, which said point is the point of intersection of said centerline with the centerline of Walt Bellamy Drive\nextended westwardly; thence from said beginning along and with the centerline of First Street northwardly to its point of intersection with the centerline of Church\nStreet extended westwardly; thence eastwardly along and with the centerline of Church Street extended and Church Street to its point of intersection with the\ncenterline of Bryan Street; thence northwardly along and with the centerline of Bryan Street to its point of intersection with the southerly line of the R.B.\nWetherington, Jr. property extended westwardly; thence eastwardly along and with the southerly line of the Wetherington property, and the southern line of the lots\nlying between those of Wetherington and Norwood Street to Norwood Street; thence crossing Norwood Street, continuing eastwardly to the southwestern corner of\nthe property occupied by Fulcher Tire Sales and Service, Inc.; thence eastwardly along and with the southern line of the Fulcher property to the centerline of Jones\nStreet; thence northwardly along and with the centerline of Jones Street and the southern right-of-way line of Pollock Street; thence eastwardly along and with the\nsouthern right-of-way line of Pollock Street to its point of intersection with the centerline of Liberty Street; thence southeastwardly along and with the centerline of\nLiberty Street to a point on the southern side of Walt Bellamy Drive, which is the point of intersection of said centerline of Liberty Street with the southern line of Lots\n1 through 11, Bellamy Park Subdivision, extended eastwardly; thence westwardly along and with said southern line extended and said southern line of the 11 lots\nwhich make up Bellamy Park Subdivision to the centerline of Norwood Street; thence northwardly along and with the centerline of Norwood Street to the centerline\nof Walt Bellamy Drive; thence westwardly along and with the centerline of Walt Bellamy Drive to its point of intersection with the centerline of First Street, the POINT\nAND PLACE OF BEGINNING.\n(b) Statement of intent. One of the city's oldest settlement areas, the Lawson Creek neighborhood was laid out as an extension of New Bern's original street grid system\nin 1779. The neighborhood was sporadically settled in the first half of the 19th century by black and white residents. Following the Civil War, the area became a\npredominantly black residential area and developed by the late 19th/early 20th century into a densely built neighborhood characterized by one and one-half and two-\nstory frame houses set close to the street on narrow deep lots.\nThe existing residential area that survives today is concentrated in a seven block area bounded generally by First Street on the west, Liberty Street on the east, Walt\nBellamy Drive on the south, and Church Street on the north. Lot widths in the neighborhood typically range from 35 feet to 60 feet with larger lots interspersed, thus\nreflecting further subdivision of the original 18th century division of the land. Houses are typically constructed on brick pier foundations and have front porches with\nprincipal entrances oriented toward the street.\nWithin the last three decades, however, the Lawson Creek neighborhood's strong urban character has eroded due to the widespread demolition of buildings and the\nplacement of mobile homes in the neighborhood. More recent stick built homes have ignored the building traditions of the older surviving homes in the neighborhood\n269 of 294\n4/22/24, 19:55\n"}, {"page": "270", "text": "New Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nby being built on slabs or being set back further from the street, thus disrupting the harmony of the streetscape. Future development in the area, if sensitively guided,\nhas the potential to positively impact the neighborhood and reestablish its urban character.\n(c) Standards. The following use and design standards and dimensional requirements are intended to integrate new residential construction into the Lawson Creek\nneighborhood in a manner that is consistent with and reinforces the character of the existing older homes: Residential:\n(1) No mobile home may be placed or erected on a lot within the conservation district regardless of the zoning district classification in which the said lot is located.\nMobile homes existing in the conservation district as of the date of the adoption of this section (July 22, 1997) shall be governed by the provisions found in section\n15-124(e) of this ordinance.\n(2) Residential structures constructed in the conservation district shall be built on a crawl space or a modified slab at least 18 inches above grade with a minimum 18\ninches masonry curtain wall exposed.\n(3) Residential structures constructed in the conservation district shall have their principal entrance facing the street and shall have a front porch or stoop element\nconsistent with other homes found in the neighborhood.\n(4) Residential structures constructed in the conservation district shall have a minimum 6/12 roof pitch and shall not exceed two and one-half stories in height.\n(5) Front yard setbacks for residential properties shall be within a zone established by the setbacks of existing structures found on the block or street. The minimum\nside yard setback for residential properties shall be five feet. Residential structures and accessory buildings shall not exceed 60 percent total lot coverage. Rear\nyard setbacks will be the resultant ground remaining from compliance with front and side yard setbacks and lot coverage requirements, but shall be no less than\nten feet.\n(Ord.

It is the intent of this section to protect and maintain the historical development patterns and neighborhood characteristics that define the\nDryborough and Riverstation neighborhoods. Conventional zoning and the movement away from traditional building patterns have eroded the neighborhood\ncharacter and threaten the sense of place and history enjoyed by the community.

Platted in 1906 as New Bern's second residential suburb, Ghent is a neighborhood of predominantly single-family houses set on compact lots\nand surrounded by mature vegetation. Roughly half of the original 130-acre subdivision was developed in the first three decades of the 20th century and consists of\none- and two-story frame and brick dwellings characterized generally by spacious front porches, uniform setbacks, vertical orientation, and bungalow and colonial\nrevival detailing popular during the period. Garages, if present, were detached and located in rear yards. This area, bounded generally by First Street on the East,\nSeventh Street on the West, Trent Boulevard on the North, and Park Avenue on the South, is designated as a National Register Historic District.\nThe remaining residential blocks to the west of Seventh Street and concentrated primarily along Spencer Avenue developed mainly in the decades after World War II.\nHouses in this section of Ghent typically were built in the popular ranch-style with no front porches and a more horizontal building orientation. Garages were also\nfrequently attached to the residence.\n(b) Neighborhood conservation district established. The Ghent neighborhood conservation district is established as a district which overlays existing zoning districts, the\nextent and boundaries of which are divided into two subareas, \"Area 1\" and \"Area 2\", and indicated on the official zoning map of the city.
