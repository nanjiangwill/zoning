It is the intent of this district to\nprovide an environment for industries that is unencumbered by nearby\nresidential or commercial development. I-2 zoned districts shall be located\nin areas where conflicts with other uses can be minimized to promote\norderly transitions and buffers between uses. The I-2 district is established\nin order to provide sites for activities that involve major transportation\nterminals, and manufacturing facilities that have a greater impact on the\nsurrounding area than industries found in the I-1 district. I-2 districts shall\ngenerally not be located adjacent to any property that is zoned for\nresidential use, except when mitigating factors (i.e., terrain, buffering, and\ntransportation access) are in place to substantively mitigate any potential\nnegative impacts upon such residential areas caused by uses in the I-2\ndistrict.

At some point in the future,\nwidening or construction of these roads will take place. In order to minimize any\nnegative impacts to adjoining property owners occurring as a result of such\nwidening projects, the TH district has been created to require that all new\nstructures lying on properties along these roads be adequately set back from\nexisting and/or projected road rights-of-way. In this manner, all structures built\nper the TH district requirements will be adequately set back from the road when it\nis widened.

Any area\nrezoned to a CZ shall be in general compliance with the goals, objectives and\nimplementation strategies of the adopted Comprehensive or Land Use Plan\nand all other plans and regulations officially adopted by the Town Council.\nThe review process established in this Section provides for the\naccommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a CZ, subject\nto specific conditions (which may exceed those that would otherwise be\nrequired for the use in question), which ensure compatibility of the use with the\nenjoyment of neighboring properties and in accordance with the general plans of\ndevelopment of the Town. A conditional zoning is not intended for securing early\nzoning for a proposal.\nOnce a property has been rezoned to a CZ, it shall be referenced with the letters\n\"CZ\" in the name of the applicable general zoning district listed in Section 6.2.\nThus, a property rezoned to a C-2 Conditional Zoning shall appear on the\nZoning Map as \"C-2 / CZ\".\nSECTION 6.5\nRESERVED\n6-11\n"}, {"page": "198", "text": "CHAPTER 7\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n7.1\nTABLE OF USES / USES NOT EXPRESSLY LISTED OR ADDRESSED\nA.\nTable 7.1-1 shows the principal uses that are allowed in each zoning\ndistrict.

Principles of Public Realm\na. Well-designed places; terminal vistas.\nb. Non-residential buildings near or at the sidewalk.\nC. Lots are typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions.\nd. Rear access alleys allowed.\n2. Principles of Transportation System\na. Connected web of streets.\nb.\nCul-de-sacs are to be avoided and, where permitted, are short in length.\nC. Curved as well as straights streets may be provided.\nd. Short blocks.\ne. Sidewalks are located on both sides of the street.\nf. Two or more points of ingress and egress are provided for the TND.\n8-23\n"}, {"page": "269", "text": "Town of McAdenville, North Carolina\nChapter 8 - Supplemental Regulations\n3. Principles of Mixed Use\na. TNDs always contain a mixture of dwelling types (e.g., single-family\ndetached, single-family attached, multi-family, dwellings atop of\ncommercial uses, etc.).\nb. Denser housing is found near a designated \"TND Center\".\nC. Civic uses are encouraged within the TND.\nd. Similar types of buildings should face each other on opposite sides of the\nstreet.\n4. Principles of Architecture\na. Commercial buildings should be of the \"shop-front\" variety that cater to the\npedestrian.\nb. Other non-residential uses within the TND should also be designed so as\nto cater to the pedestrian.\n5. Principles of the TND Center\na. Each TND must have at least one neighborhood center (i.e., TND Center)\nas a focal point of the community.\nb. The TND center is \"ideally\" located in the geographic center, although\nthere may need to be some variation to this theme to insure that the\ncenter is viable. In certain instances, a nearby, established, and\npedestrian-oriented center located outside the TND may serve as an\nalternative.\nC. The TND Center shall consist of one or more uses that serve the residents\nof the TND and can include retail, office and civic uses.\nd. With limited exceptions (i.e., financial institutions, ATMs), commercial uses\nshould not be automobile oriented.\n6. Principles of Open Space\na. Compact development should result in preservation of open space.\nb. TNDs always have public open spaces such as greens, village squares,\nparks and/or playgrounds.\nC. Smaller open space areas should be distributed throughout the TND.\nd. Pre-existing natural features should be retained (to the greatest degree\nfeasible) and be incorporated into the TND.\n7. Principles of Civic Uses in TNDs\na. Civic uses may serve TND residents only (swimming pools, meeting\ncenters) or the community as a whole (church, school).\nb. For TNDs located on tracts of less than twenty-five (25) acres, the TND\nCenter can consist entirely of civic uses that serve the TND residents only.\n8-24\n"}, {"page": "270", "text": "Town of McAdenville, North Carolina\nChapter 8 - Supplemental Regulations\nB.\nTND Development Guidelines\n1.\nAllowed Zoning Districts\nTNDs may be allowed in the R-1, R-2, R-3, RS-20, RS-12, RS-8, RMF,\nTMU, OLC, O-1, CBD, UMU, C-1 and I-U Districts.\n2.\nMaximum Residential Density\nNone\n3.\nMaximum Building Height (based on TND component)\na.\nVillage Residential- Three (3) stories\nb.\nCentral Residential- Three (3) stories\nC.\nTND Center- Five (5) stories, except three (3) stories in all R-1, R-\n2, R-3, RS-20 and RS-12 districts as well as any TND not located in\nthe Urban Standards Overlay District.\n5.\nMinimum Lot Width\nNone, except forty (40) feet on any lot containing a detached single-family\ndwelling unit.\n6.\nMinimum TND Tract Area\nTen (10) acres\n7.\nRequired TND Components\nEach TND shall contain the following four components:\na.\nTND Center- This is the \"Main Street\" of the TND and may be\nlocated within the center of the TND itself, or on the internal\nperiphery of the TND along a major road emanating from an\nexisting adjacent thoroughfare.

The resulting figure may be used\non a percentage-by-percentage basis to reduce minimum lot sizes up to a\nmaximum of twenty-five (25) percent.\nFor example, if the tract in question was fifty (50) acres in area and five (5)\nacres was to be used for right-of-way dedication purposes, and upon\nwhich direct access were not involved (i.e., Garden Parkway), the\nminimum lot size in the subdivision could be reduced by ten (10) percent\n[(5/50) X 100 = 10]. Thus, if the tract were located in a zoning district with\na minimum lot size of ten thousand (10,000) square feet, lots in the\nsubdivision could be reduced to as low as nine thousand (9,000) square\nfeet.\nB.\nMULTI-FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS AND ALL OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\nWHERE DENSITY IS MEASURED ON A UNIT-PER-ACRE BASIS\nThe density credit bonus (A1 or A2/B) shall be multiplied by the maximum\ndensity level (F) in the underlying zoning district. The resulting figure is then\nadded to (F) and then multiplied by (C), the remaining developable land in the\ntract once the right-of-way dedication has been made. In no case may the\nsubsequent density level be raised by more than twenty-five (25) percent over\nthat level which is normally allowed in the underlying zoning district.\nIrrespective of the use of density credits, all yard, height, parking, and setback\nrequirements as stated in this ordinance are to be observed.\nFor example, on a tract of land that was fifty (50) acres in area and if five\n(5) acres of land were to be dedicated for right-of-way purposes, the\ndensity bonus would amount to ten (10) percent (5/50). If the normal\nmaximum density level in this district were eight (8) units per acre, the\ndensity bonus would allow the maximum density level to increase to eight\nand eight-tenths (8.8) units per acre [(8 X 10) + 8 = 8.8].\nC.\nOTHER INONRESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS\nThe area to be computed for the density credit shall be determined (A1 or A2)\nand shall be divided by three hundred-thirty (330) square feet. The resulting\nfigure shall represent the maximum reduction in the number of required off-\nstreet parking spaces to be provided.
