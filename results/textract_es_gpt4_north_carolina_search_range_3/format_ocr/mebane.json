The\npurpose of this Section is to implement the provisions of the Water Supply\nWatershed Protection Act (NCGS 143-214.5) which requires the City of\nMebane to adopt minimum land use regulations, consistent with the WS-II\nCritical Area and Balance of Watershed management rules as adopted by\nthe North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, to protect the\nwater quality of the Graham-Mebane Lake Watershed and Upper Eno River\nWatershed located within the city's planning and zoning jurisdictional area.\nAmended June 7, 2021\nB. General Provisions Applicable to Water Supply Watershed Overlay\nC. Districts\nAmended June 7, 2021\n1. The construction of new roads and bridges and non-residential\ndevelopment should minimize built-upon area, divert stormwater away\nfrom surface water supply waters as much as possible, and employ\nbest management practices (BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts.\nTo the extent practicable, construction of new roads in the critical area\nshould be avoided. The Department of Transportation BMPs as\noutlined in their document entitled Best Management Practices for the\nProtection of Surface Waters shall be used in all road and bridge\nconstruction projects in the Watershed Overlay Districts.\n2. All development activities within Watershed Overlay Districts, in\naddition to those activities specifically regulated by these provisions,\nare subject to the standards, usage conditions and other regulations\ncontained in the Rules and Requirements of the Surface Water Supply\nProtection Rules adopted by the North Carolina Environmental\nManagement Commission.\n3. A minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is\nrequired along all perennial waters, including streams, rivers and\nimpoundments, indicated on the most recent versions of the United\nMebane UDO, Article 5\n5-32\nTable of Contents\nFebruary 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017\n"}, {"page": "248", "text": "States Geodetic Survey (USGS) 1:24,000 scale topographic maps;\nprovided, that a 50-foot buffer shall be required along Graham-Mebane\nLake. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent artificial streambank or\nshoreline stabilization. No new development is allowed in the buffer,\nexcept that water-dependent structures and public works projects such\nas road crossings and greenways, may be allowed where no\npracticable alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-upon\nsurface area, direct runoff away from the surface water, and maximize\nthe utilization of BMPs. The City's Riparian Buffer Protection\nOrdinance shall have precedence over all other stream or riparian\nbuffer regulations within the City of Mebane's Jordan Lake Watershed\njurisdiction. Stream buffers within the Falls Lake Watershed are\nadministered by the NC Department of Environmental Quality.\n4. Existing development, as defined in this Ordinance, is not subject to the\nrequirements of the overlay provisions. Expansions to structures, other\nthan single-family, classified as existing development must meet the\nrequirements of these provisions, provided however, the built-upon\narea of the existing development is not required to be included in the\ndensity calculations. In determining expansions to existing\ndevelopment, the maximum permitted additional built-upon area is\nderived by multiplying the area of the portion of the property that is not\nbuilt-upon by the appropriate percent built-upon limitation for the\nOverlay District in which the property is located.\n5. A pre-existing lot created prior to the effective date of this Ordinance,\nregardless of whether or not a vested right has been established, may\nbe developed or redeveloped for single-family residential purposes\nwithout being subject to the restrictions of these overlay provisions.\n6. Any existing building or built-upon area not in conformance with the\nlimitations of these provisions that has been damaged or removed for\nany reason may be repaired and/or reconstructed, provided:\n(a) Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and completed\nwithin 2 years of such damage or removal.\n(b) The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be\nincreased.\n(c) The repair or reconstruction is otherwise permitted under the provisions\nof this Ordinance.\n7. Clustering of development if permitted by the underlying use district is\nallowed on a project by project basis as follows: overall density of the\nproject meets associated density or stormwater control requirements;\nbuilt upon areas are designed and sited to minimize stormwater runoff\nimpact to the receiving waters and minimizes concentrated stormwater\nflow; remainder of tract to remain in vegetated or natural state.\nMebane UDO, Article 5\n5-33\nTable of Contents\nFebruary 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017\n"}, {"page": "249", "text": "8. No activity, situation, structure or land use shall be permitted or allowed\nto operate within a watershed which poses a threat to water quality and\nthe public health, safety and welfare.

Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the\nrepetition of roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and\noutdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door\npatterns, and the use of building materials that have color, shades, and\ntextures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed\ndevelopment.\nB. [Reserved] Amended June , 2022\nC. Building Design Standards\nDesign standards promote creativity and innovation while discouraging obtrusive,\nincongruous structures. The City discourages architectural styles that do not build\nupon and promote the existing character of the City.

Harmony of Design\nThe purpose of this subsection is to preserve the design character of existing\ndevelopment, to protect the visual pattern of the community, and to promote\nharmony in the visual relationships and transitions between new and older\nbuildings. New buildings should respect the scale, form, and proportion of existing\ndevelopment. This can be done by repeating building lines and surface\ntreatments and by requiring some uniformity of detail, scale, proportion, texture,\nmaterials, color, and building form.\n1. Building Color Shades\nBuilding color shades shall be used to facilitate blending into the\nneighborhood and unify the development. The color shades of building\nmaterials shall draw from the range of color shades that already exist on the\nblock or in the adjacent neighborhood.\n2.\nBuilding Materials\nMebane UDO, Article 6\n6-2\nFebruary 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; September 11, 2017; July 7, 2019; June 7, 2021; June 6, 2022; July 11, 2022\n"}, {"page": "334", "text": "Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used\nin the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other\ncharacteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing,\ncolor, and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough similarity exists for\nthe building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials.\n3.\nSimilar Size and Height for Infill Development\nNew infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger,\nbe articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass\nand scale of other structures on the same block, or if no buildings exist\nthereon, then on adjoining blocks.\n4.\nUnify Individual Storefronts\nIf several storefronts are located in one building, the individual storefronts\nshall be unified in all exterior design elements, such as mass, window and\ndoor placement, color, materials, and signage.\n5.\nAdditions and Renovations\nBuilding additions and fa\u00e7ade renovations should be designed to reflect\nexisting buildings in scale, materials, window treatment, and color.
