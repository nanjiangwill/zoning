The purpose of this Chapter is to:\n1.\nEstablish Districts. Establish base, special purpose, and overlay zoning districts that implement the\nComprehensive Plan, known as the Harrisburg Area Land Use Plan (HALUP), that provide for\ndevelopment and redevelopment within the Town, and that correspond to the purpose statements set\nout in Table 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts;\n2.\nDevelopmental and Dimensional Standards. Provide developmental and dimensional standards for\nsuch districts;\n3.\nLand Use Standards. Provide standards for specific land uses that are listed as limited or special in \u00a7\n140.02, Zoning Districts and Standards.\n4.\nMeasurements and Allowances. Establish methods for measuring various characteristics of a structure,\nlot, or other features and provide allowances for administrative flexibility related to such features.\nB. Applicability.\n1.\nEffect. The districts set out in this Chapter apply to all land, buildings, structures, and appurtenances\nwithin the corporate boundaries of the Town and the extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n2.\nStandards. The standards of this Chapter apply to new development, redevelopment, and substantially\nimproved properties.\n3.\nTransition to New Districts. As of the effective date of this Title, land zoned with a district classification\nfrom the previous Unified Development Ordinance will be reclassified to one of the district\nclassifications in this Chapter, as set out in Section 140.01.03, Zoning Districts Establishment.\nDisplayed in Table 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts, are the name and letter designation of each district,\nhow each district relates to the Harrisburg Area Land Use Plan (HALUP) designations, the purpose of\nthe district, and the former zoning district designation.\nC.\nRequired Conformance. Except as specified otherwise in this UDO, no building or land may be used, and\nno building may be erected, altered, or moved that is used or designed to be used for any purpose other\nthan a use that is permitted or conditionally permitted in a zoning district in which that building or land is\nlocated. To be built upon, a parcel of land shall be platted or meet the requirements and criteria set out in\nChapter 142, Subdivision Standards.\n140.01.02 Official Zoning Map\nA.\nIncorporated by Reference. The Official Zoning Map, together with all legends, references, symbols,\nboundaries, and other information, is part of, and has the same force of law as the text of this UDO. The\nOfficial Zoning Map is incorporated by reference in this UDO.\nB.\nBoundaries. The boundaries of zoning districts established by this UDO shall be designated on a map or\nmaps entitled Official Zoning Map(s) of the Town of Harrisburg.\nC.\nLocation. The Official Zoning Map shall be on file and available for inspection during regular business hours\nin the Office of the Director and a copy of the Official Zoning Map shall be kept on file with the Town Clerk.\nAny changes thereto shall be clearly shown on the Official Zoning Map.\nD.\nOfficial Record. The Official Zoning Map shall be the official record of zoning status of areas within the\nTown.

If a zoning district is eliminated and there is no corresponding zoning district\nclassification on the Official Zoning Map, the property shall remain subject to all restrictions, regulations and\nconditions imposed under the UDO in effect at the time that the Former Official Zoning Map was effective,\nunless and until the zoning classification of the property is amended pursuant to this UDO.\nF.\nPUD. If a property is zoned \"PUD\" at the time of adoption of this UDO, it shall remain subject to all terms,\nconditions, and restrictions of approval under the UDO in effect when the PUD classification was approved,\nincluding any specific modifications of the then-existing PUD or general regulations, and any approved final\nplans, unless and until the zoning classification of such property is amended pursuant to this UDO.\nG.\nInterpreting the Official Zoning Map. Where the map appears to be unclear regarding the location of\ndistrict boundaries, or where there is a dispute as to the boundary or location of property within a zoning\ndistrict, the boundaries shall be interpreted by the Director who shall make a determination using the\nfollowing criteria:\n1.\nRights-of-Way or Easements. Where boundary lines appear to follow existing streets, alleys, railroad\ntracks, utility lines, or similar features, the zoning boundary shall be construed to follow the center line\nof the rights-of-way or easement. Where the location of these features on the ground differs from that\nshown on the Official Zoning Map, the features on the ground control.\n2.\nTown or County Limits and Section Lines. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately\nfollowing the Town or County limits or section lines, such Town or County limits or section lines shall\nbe considered the district boundaries.\n3.\nProperty Lines. Where the boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines, such\nlines shall be construed to be the boundaries.\n4.\nWatercourses. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline\nof drainage ways, streams, water bodies, or other watercourses shall be construed as following\nthe centerline. In the event of a natural change in the location of such streams or other watercourses,\nthe zoning district boundary shall be construed as moving with the centerline.\n5.\nDivided Parcels. If a parcel of land is divided by a zoning district boundary line at the time of enactment\nof this UDO or by subsequent amendments to this UDO, the appropriate standards and uses for each\ndistrict shall apply on the portion of the parcel covered by that district.\nH.\nMeasurement. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the\nscale of the map.\nI.\nVacation or Abandonment. Where a public right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations\napplicable to the abutting property apply equally to the vacated or abandoned street or alley.\nJ.\nAnnexed and Undesignated Lands. For the purposes of ensuring that all land has a zoning designation,\nany land that is annexed into the Town shall be zoned in accordance with its associated future land uses as\nset forth in the Harrisburg Area Land Use Plan (HALUP).\nK.\nUncertain Boundaries. If the boundary remains uncertain, the Planning and Zoning Board, acting as the\nBoard of Adjustment, shall interpret the Official Zoning Map to determine the location of the boundary in\nquestion\nL.\nAppeals. Any aggrieved person may appeal such determination to the Planning and Zoning Board, acting as\nthe Board of Adjustment, as set out in Sec. 145.01.11, Appeals of Legislative, Quasi-Judicial, and\nSubdivision Decisions.\n140.01.03 Zoning District Establishment\nA.\nGenerally. The Town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) are divided into zoning districts as enumerated\nin Table 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts, below, which specifies each district along with the recommended land\nuse category of the Future Land Use Map of the Harrisburg Area Land Use Plan (HALUP).\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 140, $140.01 - Page 2\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNC\nThe right side of opportunity\nB.\nHALUP Consistency. Pursuant to NCGS 160D-501, Plans, this UDO shall be consistent with the\nHALUP. This Section describes the relationship between the various zoning districts and the land use\ncategories described in the HALUP, along with the purposes of each district.\nC.\nDistrict Types.\n1.\nBase Districts. The districts set out in Table 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts, are those for which uses are\npermitted by right (permitted), subject to supplemental standards (limited), or subject to a public\nhearing (special use). Base districts may be established by Town Council approval as set out in Sec.\n145.03.02, Zoning Map Amendment. Such approval authorizes the full range of uses in accordance\nwith the standards applicable to the district.\n2.\nConditional Zoning Districts. Conditional zoning districts may be established by the Town Council\npursuant to the procedures established in Subsection 145.03.03, Conditional Zoning Approval.\nConditional zoning districts parallel general zoning districts and require concurrent site plan approval,\nwhich incorporates district-specific conditions agreed to by the owner(s) of the rezoned land. The land\nuses prescribed for the parallel district in 140.02, Zoning Districts and Standards, are the same as\nthose allowed in a Conditional District. No additional land uses may be added as part of the\nconditions. In the event that a Special Use Permit is required in a general zoning district, a Special\nUse Permit will also be required for the Conditional District.\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 140, $140.01 - Page 3\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nTable 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts\nCELL (1, 4): \nTable 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts\nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nZoning District\nCELL (2, 2): \nHALUP\nFuture Land\nUse\nCategory\nCELL (2, 3): \nDevelopment Type\nCELL (2, 4): \nPurpose\nCELL (2, 5): \nFormer Zoning District\nCELL (3, 1): \nAgricultural and Residential\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (4, 1): \nAG, Agricultural\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCountryside\nCELL (4, 4): \nProvide areas for low-intensity\nagricultural operations, agri-business,\nwhere appropriate, supportive rural\nbusiness uses, protect and preserve\nvaluable agricultural areas and\npasturelands, and set very low\nresidential densities.\nCELL (4, 5): \nAG, Agricultural\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nVery Low\nDensity\nResidential\nCELL (5, 3): \nConventional\nCELL (5, 4): \nProvide transition areas between low-\nand medium- or high-density\nresidential land uses, designed\nas larger, estate-sized lots.\nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (6, 1): \nRE, Rural Estate\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (6, 3): \nConservation\nCELL (6, 4): \nProvides conservation development\nwith smaller lots that are clustered\naround common open space to protect\nenvironmental resources, such as\nwoodlands, wetlands, floodplains and\nriparian areas, and as a buffer or\nrecreational set-aside.\nCELL (6, 5): \nRE, Rural Estate\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nLow Density\nCELL (7, 3): \nConventional\nCELL (7, 4): \nProvide areas for low- density single-\nfamily residential; uses on moderately-\nsized lots.\nCELL (7, 5): \nRL, Residential Low-\nCELL (8, 1): \nRL, Residential Low\nCELL (8, 2): \nLow Density\nResidential\nCELL (8, 3): \nConservation\nCELL (8, 4): \nProvide smaller lots clustered around\ncommon open space used as buffers\nand to preserve environmentally-\nsensitive and agricultural land areas.\nCELL (8, 5): \nRL, Residential Low-\nDensity\n"}, {"page": "6", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNC\nThe right side of opportunity\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 140, $140.01 - Page 4\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nTable 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts\nCELL (1, 4): \nTable 140.01.03-1, Zoning Districts\nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nZoning District\nCELL (2, 2): \nHALUP\nFuture Land\nUse\nCategory\nCELL (2, 3): \nDevelopment Type\nCELL (2, 4): \nPurpose\nCELL (2, 5): \nFormer Zoning District\nCELL (3, 1): \nRM, Residential\nMedium\nCELL (3, 2): \nMedium\nDensity\nCELL (3, 3): \nConventional\nCELL (3, 4): \nProvide areas for medium-density,\nsingle-family residential uses on\nsmaller lots or single-family detached\nand attached dwellings clustered\naround common open space used as\nbuffers between districts or housing\ntypes and to provide for resource\nprotection and preservation of sensitive\nlands.\nCELL (3, 5): \nRM-1, Residential\nMedium-Density\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nResidential\nCELL (4, 3): \nConservation\nCELL (4, 4): \nProvide areas for single-family\ndetached and attached dwellings\nclustered around common open space\nused as buffers between districts or\nhousing types and to provide for\nresource protection and preservation of\nsensitive lands.\nCELL (4, 5): \nRM-2, Residential\nMedium Density\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \nConventional\nCELL (5, 4): \nProvide areas for single-\nfamily detached and attached dwellings\nand, in a master planned development,\nmultiple-family dwellings where both\ndensities and open spaces increase\nproportionately.

The Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) sub-district is a sub-district of the Mixed\nUse (MU) district.\n2.\nPhysical Conventions. The TND option is designed to permit the development of land in a manner\nconsistent with traditional neighborhoods. Its provisions adapt the urban conventions which were normal in\nthe United States from colonial times until the 1940's. The TND ordinance prescribes the following physical\nconventions:\na.\nThe neighborhood is spatially understood and limited in size.\nb.\nResidences, shops, workplaces, civic buildings and parks are interwoven within the neighborhood, all\nin close proximity and connected by a system of sidewalks.\nC.\nThe hierarchy, design and detailing of streets, serves equitably the needs of pedestrians, bicycles and\nautomobiles.\nd.\nCarefully placed civic buildings and squares reinforce the identity of the neighborhood.\ne.\nSpatially defined squares and parks are distributed and designed as specialized places for social\nactivity and recreation.\nf.\nCivic buildings provide places of assembly for social, cultural and religious activities, becoming\nsymbols of community identity through their architectural clarity.\ng.\nPrivate buildings form a disciplined edge, spatially delineating the public street space and the private\nblock interior.\nh.\nArchitecture and landscape respond to the unique character of the region and traditional design\nprinciples with attention toward a classic sense of timelessness. Designs shall preserve the charm and\nunity of the neighborhood as a whole.\ni.\nBy providing a full range of housing types and workplaces, residents of all ages are blended together,\nforming the bonds of an authentic community.\nj.\nThe provision of comfortable public spaces such as streets and squares, residents may come to know\neach other to watch over their collective security.\nk.\nBy bringing within walking distance most of the activities of daily living, including dwelling, shopping\nand working, the elderly and the young gain independence of movement.\nI.\nThe compact layout of TND reduces the requirements for infrastructure, automobile use and traffic\ncongestion. By organizing appropriate building densities, public transit becomes a viable alternative\nmode for local travel.\n3.\nRestrictive Covenants. A set of restrictive covenants and design codes shall be established for each TND\nby the developer and shall be binding on all property owners.\n4.\nProperty Owners Association. A Property Owners Association, shall be formed to guide the growth,\nenforce the restrictive covenants, and govern the citizens of the TND.\n5.\nRemoval.

Following approval of a Final Site Plan and Final Plat, the\nfirst 75 percent of all Certificate of Compliance and Occupancy for dwelling units may be issued prior to the\nestablishment of any nonresidential use. No Certificate Compliance and Occupancy may be issued for the\nremaining dwelling units until a Zoning Clearance has been for the remaining nonresidential floor area.\n11.\nTND Site Plan.

The Town of Harrisburg sees the interaction between the built environment and the public as\na crucial ingredient in maintaining a certain sense of place. As a part of this, the visual aspects overall\nbuilding design and placement shall be scrutinized when considering a proposed development. This Section\noutlines design standards for building fa\u00e7ades. These standards seek to increase the prospect of\ncompatibility between buildings, styles, and generations. Designers shall infuse their individual talents and\ncreativity into each project for these standards to be successful.\nB.\nGenerally.\n1.\nApplicability. Unless otherwise specified, the general provisions of this Subsection shall apply to all\nmulti-family, nonresidential, mixed use, city center, and industrial buildings in addition to the specific\nstandards in Subsections 141.02.03, Multi-Family and Single-Family Attached, through 141.02.06,\nIndustry.\n2.\nZero Lot Line. The general provisions of this Subsection do not apply to zero lot line houses or single-\nfamily attached. Refer to Subsection 141.02.02 or 141.02.03 for applicable standards for these\nbuilding types.\n3.\nFlexibility in Administration. Because these standards cannot cover every possible scenario that may\narise, the Director is authorized to make determinations on development applications that may vary\nfrom the written standards so long as the determination meets the intent of this Section and\nSubsection.\nC. Materials.\n1.\nPercentages. Building walls shall incorporate brick, cast stone, formed concrete, or other long-lasting\nmasonry material acceptable to the Director over a minimum percentage of surface area (excluding\nwindows, doors, and curtain walls). The remainder of wall area may incorporate other materials.\nMinimum percentages are required as follows, and as illustrated in Figure 141.02.01-1, Materials:\na.\nCommercial and mixed-use buildings: 75 percent of surface area minimum on all sides of the\nbuilding visible from a public right-of-way or residential property; and\nb.\nMulti-family and single-family attached with two or more units: 40 percent of surface area\nminimum on all sides of the building visible from a public right-of-way or residential property.\n2.\nConsistency. All buildings on the same parcel, including gasoline pump canopies, sign bases, and\ndrive-thru canopies shall be consistent in terms of architectural style and the use of similar materials.\n3.\nVariations. Differing buildings, businesses, or activities within the same development, as opposed to\nthe same specific parcel, may be distinguished by utilizing variations of the same architectural style\nand materials.\n4.\nSides and Backs. Sides and backs of buildings visible from the public right-of-way shall be as visually\nattractive as the front by using the same materials and architectural detailing throughout. Sides\nadjacent to undevelopable land and tree save areas that are not visible from the public right-of-way\nmay use different materials and architectural detail as approved by the Director.\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 141, $141.02 - Page 1\n"}, {"page": "98", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNC\nThe right side of opportunity\n5.\nProhibited Materials.\na.\nNo building elevation may be primarily covered (exposed) with sheet or corrugated aluminum,\niron or steel, plain concrete, plain concrete block, or exterior panelized plywood.\nb.\nExcept, however, such materials may be used as secondary exterior finish materials if they cover\nno more than 10 percent of the surface area.

The purpose of this Section is to provide:\na.\nOwners of abutting property with the maximum service feasible, consistent with the safe and\nefficient use of Town streets;\nb.\nA uniform ordinance for the design, location, operation and construction of driveways throughout\nthe Town; and\nC. Maximum safety and protection to the public through the regulation of vehicles entering and\nexiting public streets.\n2.\nApplicability. This Section shall apply to all driveways or access points planned to connect to a Town\nmaintained street. The provisions of this Section shall regulate only that portion of a private driveway\nthat connects to a public street and extends to the edge of a public right-of-way.\n3.\nDriveways on Major Thoroughfares. The Town's intent is to further increase safety and decrease\ncongestion along specified major thoroughfares. In order to accomplish these objectives, certain goals\nhave been identified. These goals are:\na. To prohibit driveways within a certain distance of intersecting streets unless alternate access is\nnot available,\nb.\nTo decrease the number of driveways along major thoroughfares, and\nC.\nTo increase the distance between adjacent driveways along major thoroughfares.\n4.\nEnforcement. This Section is to be administered by the Town of Harrisburg Public Works Director\nand/or his/her designee(s). The issuance of a Driveway Permit as prescribed by this Section shall be\nissued by the Harrisburg Public Works Director /or his/her designee(s) for driveways that access a\nstreet maintained by the Town and issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation for\ndriveways that access a street maintained by the state.\n5.\nSafety. The safety and efficiency of a roadway is impacted by the amount and type of interference\nexperienced by the vehicles moving on it. Some interference may result from other vehicles on the\nroadway, moving in either the same or the opposite direction. The major form of interference, however,\nis from vehicles entering, leaving, or crossing the roadway at intersecting streets and driveways. In\norder to reduce interference with traffic flow, minimize accidents and assure the best overall utilization\nof the roadway by the motoring public, it is necessary to regulate vehicles entering and leaving\nroadside developments and intersecting streets.\n6.\nRight of Access. The Town of Harrisburg recognizes the legal rights of the abutting property owners to\nhave access to their property. However, it must also consider the right of other roadway users to travel\nwith relative safety and freedom interference. Since these rights are at times in conflict, it is the Town's\nresponsibility to reconcile and, to the extent feasible, satisfy the needs and desires of all roadway\nusers.\nB.\nDriveway Design Standards.\n1.\nDriveway Width. The width, in feet, or a driveway approach and curb return flare or radius shall be\nwithin the minimum and maximum limits as specified in Table 141.03.07-1, Design Standards for\nDriveway Width, below. All driveway approach widths shall be measured at the street right-of-way line\nand the width of any driveway shall not increase when crossing the right-of-way except at properly\ndesignated curb returns. The width and radius of street type driveways and width of private street\nentrances shall be determined by the Public Works Director within the limits of this ordinance.\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 141, $141.03 - Page 18\n"}, {"page": "142", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNC\nThe right side of opportunity\n2.\nNumber and spacing of driveway approaches. Driveways shall be allocated and spaced as outlined in\nTable 141.03.07-2, Driveway Spacing, below, provided all other requirements of this article are\nmet. Single-family and duplex developments on individual lots of record shall be exempt from these\nstandards. However, driveways associated with these uses shall not be located within any site triangles.\nTABLE NOTE:\nAccess separation between driveways shall be measured from inside edge to inside edge of driveway. Access separation between a driveway\nand intersecting street shall be measured from the nearest edge of the driveway to the intersecting right-of-way lines. The maximum number of\ndriveways allowed for any parcel prior to subdivision of property shall be three and shall meet the minimum spacing requirements of this\nordinance.\n3.\nDriveway Design.\na.\nAll residential driveways shall be at least 18 feet in length from the edge of the pavement where the\nstructure begins to the edge of the pavement where the sidewalk or street begins. At no time shall\nvehicles be parked over sidewalks or encroach into streets. Parking shall also not be allowed on\nthe grass in residential development. All single-family residential homes require two parking\nspaces per unit per Section 141.03.02, Parking Ratios and Design. If additional parking is needed\ndue to the size of the homes (i.e. based on the number of bedrooms), the developer shall install\noverflow parking on each parcel to accommodate additional vehicles or design an overflow parking\nlot\nwithin the development. Design of overflow parking is subject to review by the Director.\nb.\nAll driveway approaches shall be a concrete apron section (\"ramp\" type), except that street type\ndriveway entrances may be required for public or private developments that have parking spaces\nfor 200 or more vehicles or when special conditions exist as determined by the Public Works\nDirector. The concrete apron shall be installed to the right-of-way line or at least 10 feet from the\nedge of the roadway and/or back of curb.\nC.\nRamp type driveway approaches may use either a standard drop curb opening or curb radius from\nthe street curb to the inside sidewalk line. If a curb radius used, the top elevation of the curb radius\nmust be held level with the elevation of the street curb, and the driveway apron must be raised to\nmeet the elevation of the curbline at the inside sidewalk line.\nd.\nDriveway approaches shall cross the sidewalk area at the sidewalk grade established by the Public\nWorks Director.

The purpose of buffer yards is to provide a transitional buffer between zoning districts and/or uses\nthat may differ in development intensity and density, provide a minimum buffer between uses of similar\nintensity and density and provide land space buffer between back-to-back lots within a subdivision. These\nlandscaped planting yards are intended to ensure that a natural area of appropriate size and density of\nplantings is planted or preserved between zoning districts and/or uses.\nB.\nStandards.\n1.\nGenerally.

Minimum dimensions shall apply, and be\nmeasured, horizontally.\nb.\nWidths shall be measured from the respective property line, except where buffer yards are\npermitted to straddle property lines, as set forth in this Section. Where buffer yards turn at\nproperty corners, the length measurements determining plant quantities shall not be required to\noverlap.\n3.\nBerm Slope. A berm required as part of a buffer yards shall have a minimum downward slope of\nfive percent and a maximum upward slope of 25 percent. In order to accommodate a berm, the buffer\nyard may need to be wider than required in Table 141.04.03-2, Buffer Yard Landscaping Requirements\nFor example, a Type C buffer yard would have to be over 48 feet in width in order to accommodate\nthe berm, but will only require the amount of plantings required for a Type C buffer yard.\nC.\nBuffer Yard Types. There shall be five different classes of zoning districts and land uses for purposes of\ndetermining the buffer yard type.

Where fences or walls are part of a buffer yard, plants shall be installed on the outside of\nthe fence or wall, facing toward the neighboring property. Fences and walls shall not decrease the plantable\narea by more than one foot in width along the buffer yard, including any geo-grid that would limit tree\ninstallation.\nQ.\nMaintenance of Buffer. It is the intent of the Town that all buffers will be maintained in their natural state\nand will not be excessively pruned or trimmed except as necessary to maintain compliance with all other\ntown regulations, such as those prohibiting obstruction of roadway sight distances or obstruction to the free\nuse of public sidewalks or streets. Infectious, invasive, exotic, dead, and damaged trees may be removed if\nno damage is done to other vegetation.\n141.04.04 Tree Protection Standards\nA.\nPurpose. Preserving existing healthy vegetation on a site during development enhances the visual character\nof the community by screening and softening the impact of buildings and balancing the scale of buildings in\naddition to preserving wildlife habitat, controlling surface water runoff, and moderating temperatures. The\ngoal is to preserve existing and significant vegetation to the extent practical and reasonable, while taking\nunique site conditions and features into consideration. Preservation of trees and existing vegetation\nultimately conserves water because of factors such as increased absorption ability and reduced heat effects.\nThe preservation of perimeter buffers and significant vegetation inside the buffers is a goal that warrants\nflexibility on the Town's part in administering these requirements.\nB.\nPurpose. In addition to the requirements of Section 141.04.01.A, Landscape Plan Requirements, the\npurpose of the tree survey is to identify those areas of vegetation, including heritage trees and significant\nvegetation, before site and/or subdivision plans are so far advanced that it is unreasonable and impractical\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 141, $141.04 - Page 21\n"}, {"page": "168", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNo\nThe right side of opportunity\nto modify the plans to protect the vegetation identified to be saved on the tree survey.

During development of property, the owner shall be responsible for\nthe erection of any and all barriers necessary to protect any existing or installed vegetation from damage\nboth during and after construction. Any unauthorized disturbance within the boundaries of the tree protection\nareas shall result in fines as identified in Chapter 147, Enforcement and Remedies, in addition to any other\nfines and replanting requirements for the removal or damage of vegetation within tree protection areas.\nE.\nProtective Fencing. All existing trees and vegetation that is to be preserved, including buffers, shall be\ncompletely enclosed with a sturdy and visible fence that encircles the critical root zone of the trees or buffers\nto be preserved before grading begins according to the following.\n1.\nWhere Required. Required fencing shall be installed a minimum of six feet from the trunk of preserved\ntrees. Fencing of areas adjacent to existing and proposed roadways is required if the preserved tree's\ncritical root zone is within three feet of the public right-of-way. Fencing is required on all Town and\nDepartment of Transportation road projects that are adjacent to protected streetscapes or buffers. The\napplicant and Director shall consider existing site conditions in determining the exact location of any\ntree protection fencing.\n2.\nType of Fence. All fencing required by this Section shall be four feet orange polyethylene laminar\nfencing a minimum four feet high and of durable construction.

The fencing shall be removed after the final site inspection for the\nCertificate of Compliance and Occupancy.\nF.\nEncroachments into Root Zones. Permanent encroachments within the critical root zone of\na\npreserved tree shall occur only in rare instances. If such an encroachment is anticipated, the following\npreventative measures shall be employed:\n1.\nClearing Activities. The removal of trees adjacent to a preserved tree's critical root zone may cause\ninadvertent damage to the preserved tree. The applicant shall cut trenches in that area a minimum\nof one and one half feet deep along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots.\n2.\nSoil. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the tree protection area, the\narea shall first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a\nsix-inch layer of pine straw.

Backfill shall be provided with clean, dry soil within hours of root pruning.\nH.\nSpecific Requirements for Heritage Trees. The intent of this subsection is to protect healthy heritage\ntrees on sites during the development process. With this in mind, flexibility in site design is provided for to\noffset area used to preserve heritage trees by deducting area from other required landscape/buffer\nareas. Heritage Trees shall be noted on the rezoning site plan early in the development process or during\nthe site plan review for non-rezoning development projects. No heritage tree may be removed during\ndevelopment, unless the approval criteria of this Section are met and the tree is replaced pursuant to this\nSection. In support of any application which requests removal of a heritage tree, the applicant shall submit a\nreport from a certified arborist or other such specialist.\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 141, $141.04 - Page 23\n"}, {"page": "170", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNC\nright side of opportunity\n1.\nRemoval of Heritage Trees. The Director shall approve removal of a heritage tree if the tree is\nadversely impacted by one of the following and no practical alternative location exists:\na.\nRequired road connections;\nb.\nRequired sanitary sewer or storm drain lines;\nC.\nPublic infrastructure improvements made by others;\nd.\nRequired stormwater treatment devices located in geographically and topographically appropriate\nareas; or\ne.\nTown design standards that limit the location of buildings and/or other features such as parking\nand requirements for the building to front on streets.\n2.\nReplacement of Heritage Trees.\na.\nWhen a heritage tree is removed during construction, or dies within one year following\nconstruction, on a site located outside of the City Center (CC) district, the applicant or developer\nshall replace such heritage tree on-site, except as allowed in paragraph e., below, with trees of\nsimilar type planted at least 30 feet from any other tree such that the total caliper inches of trees\nplanted is no less two times the diameter of the tree removed. The size of such replacement\ntrees at the time of installation shall be a minimum of three inches in caliper. The Director may\noffer flexibility with the required spacing of the trees depending on the type of tree removed and\nthe type of tree being used as a replacement.\nb.\nWhen a heritage tree is removed during construction, or dies within one year following\nconstruction, on a site located within the City Center (CC) district, the applicant or developer shall\ncomply with the requirements of this Section except that the total caliper inches of trees planted\nmay be 25 percent less than the diameter of the tree removed if it is not practical to replant the\nrequired number and size of trees spaced at least 30 feet from any other tree on the same site or\nany adjacent property under common ownership. The Director may offer flexibility with the\nrequired spacing of the trees depending on the type of tree removed and the type of tree being\nused as a replacement.\nC.\nIn consultation with the Town staff, acceptable replacement trees shall be determined by a\nperson qualified by training or experience to have expert knowledge of the subject. Alternatively,\nthe valuation of trees removed may be established in accordance with standards established by\nthe International Society of Arboriculture and replaced with landscaping of equal dollar value.\nd.\nReplacement trees shall be maintained through an establishment period of at least three years,\nexcept that single-family detached dwellings on an individual lot shall have an establishment\nperiod of only one year. The property owner and developer shall execute a landscape agreement\nguaranteeing the survival and health of all replacement trees during the establishment period and\nguaranteeing to replace any replacement tree(s) that does not survive the establishment period\nin\ngood health as determined by a certified arborist.\ne.\nAlthough the Town desires 100 percent on-site tree replacement, if the Director determines that it\nis impossible or impractical, the remaining balance of required replacement trees shall be planted\non the nearest site owned by Town or other public entity (for example, a park, school, or similar\nproperty) where the Director determines there is sufficient capacity to accommodate this option.\nThe Director may allow tree replacement on an adjacent privately-owned site where the tree\nreplanting area will be permanently preserved via covenant or easement. Planting shall\nbe\ncarried out directly by the landowner with direction and inspection of the Director or other\nappropriate Town staff.\n3.\nAlternatives for Replacement of Heritage Trees.\na.\nA development may meet the total inches required for mitigation in subsection 3, Replacement of\nHeritage Trees, by planting larger shade trees for the required buffers and/or landscaping. Any\nshade tree that is planted larger than the required minimum size may use the excess inches to\ncount towards the Heritage Tree replacement requirements.

These areas\nthat are to be protected are called \"Tree Save Areas\" and shall be protected as outlined above.\nC.\nThe developer may choose to upgrade the size of the required side and rear buffer yards in\nSection 141.04.03, Buffer Yards, in exchange for a reduction of the Heritage Tree replacement\nrequirements. This standard is only applicable for non-residential developments. Upgrading to a\nType B buffer grants a reduction of 25 percent of total inches to be replaced. Upgrading to a\nType C buffer grants a reduction of 30 percent of total inches to be replaced. Upgrading to a\nType D buffer grants a reduction of 35 percent of total inches to be replaced.\n4.\nExemptions. Nonresidential lots that are less than two acres in size are exempt from the requirements\nset forth under this Section in relation to heritage trees.\nI.\nWaivers for Emergencies. During emergencies, such as windstorms, ice storms, fire, or other disasters,\nthe Director may waive the requirements of this Section in order to avoid hampering private or public work to\nrestore order in the Town. This Section shall not be used, however, to otherwise circumvent the\nrequirements of this Section.\nJ.\nClear Cutting of Trees and Other Vegetation.\n1.\nThe removal or clear cutting of trees and other existing vegetation on undeveloped or under-developed\nsites within the corporate limits or extra-territorial jurisdiction is prohibited except as otherwise\npermitted in this Subsection.\n2.\nAny clear cutting or vegetation removal on vacant, undeveloped, or underdeveloped sites shall be\ndone in accordance with an approved site and/or subdivision plan.\n3.\nAny property that has vegetation removed prior to a request for an approved site and/or subdivision\nplan shall be required to wait a minimum of three years before submitting an application for any\ndevelopment approvals.\n4.\nThis provision shall not apply to any property that is being managed in accordance with an approved\nForestry Management Plan through the North Carolina Forestry Service, and any such plan shall be\nsubmitted as part of the development plan request.\nK.\nPenalties. A violation of this Section where dead or fatally damaged trees or stumps are absent after the\nviolation shall subject the violator to a civil penalty of $1,000 plus 35 cents of every square foot of land area\nwhere the violation occurred. Where dead or fatally damaged trees or stumps are present after the violation,\nthe civil penalty shall instead be calculated as $1,000 per dead or damaged tree plus $100 per diameter inch\nper dead or damaged tree. Civil penalties shall be processed as set forth in Chapter 147, Enforcement and\nRemedies.\n141.04.05 Alternative Compliance\nA.\nGenerally. Under the criteria listed below, the Director or Planning and Zoning Board, as appropriate, may\nreview and approve an alternative compliance Landscape Plan upon determining that such plan meets the\nfollowing criteria.\nB.\nPurpose. The alternative compliance Landscape Plan meets the purpose of this Section; and\nC.\nConditions. Site conditions inhibit creative site design or pose prohibitive constraints to appropriate\ndevelopment as a result of strict compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section in a minimum of\none of the following manners:\n1.\nShape and Size. The subject property is peculiarly-shaped, through no action of the owner or previous\nowner, or contains extensive undeveloped are;\n2.\nLimitations.

The area of a sign face is computed by means of the\nsmallest square or rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation,\nemblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background\nof the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed,\nbut not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when that fence or\nwall otherwise meets UDO regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. Refer to\nFigure 141.05.06, Sign Area and Height Measurement.\n2.\nComputation of Area of Multi-faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face is\ncomputed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical\nsign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same\ntime, and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure and not more than 42 inches apart,\nthe sign area is computed by the measurement of one of the faces.\n3.\nComputation of Overall Height. The overall height of a sign is computed as the distance from the base\nof the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign.

As an alternative to the dedication of a portion of such land by the\nsubdivider and where it is determined by the Town Council that a dedication of land is not feasible in a\ngiven plat or incompatible with the HALUP, the subdivider may make provision for an equitable amount\nof land in another location, or pay to the Town a fee in lieu of dedication as provided in Subsection F.5,\nbelow.\n4.\nCriteria for Dedication. All land dedicated for recreation and park development shall substantially meet\nthe following criteria:\na.\nUnity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land except where the Planning Board\ndetermines that a connecting path or strip of land is in the public interest, and in which case the\npath shall not be less than 25 feet wide.\nb.\nShape.

The dedicated land shall be usable for recreation; lakes may not be included in\ncomputing dedicated land area. Where the Planning Board and the Parks and Recreation\nAdvisory Board determine that recreational needs are being adequately met, either by other\ndedicated parcels of land or existing recreational facilities, then land that is not usable for\nrecreation may be dedicated as open space. The Parks and Recreation Advisory Board shall\nsupply the Planning Board with comments and/or recommendations in order to assist the Board\nin making this determination.\ng.\nPlans. Municipal and County plans shall be taken into consideration when evaluating land\nproposals for dedication.\n5.\nCriteria for Determining Dedication and Fee.

At the time ofa rezoning process or the preliminary plat approval (if rezoning is not\nrequired and is a by-right development), the owner of the property shall, as part of such filing,\nindicate whether he desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof. If the desire is to dedicate land for this\npurpose, the dedicated area shall be shown on the preliminary plat and recorded as such in the\nFinal Plat\n7.\nComputation of Fee Payable in Lieu of Dedication. Where a fee is paid in lieu of dedication, the amount\nof such payment shall be the product of the number of acres to be dedicated and the average fair\nmarket value of the land being subdivided at the time of submission of the preliminary subdivision plat.\nFair market value shall be determined by the Town Council on the advice of the Planning Board based\nupon current appraisals and acceptable to the subdivider.\n8.\nUse by Town. The land received by the Town under this UDO shall be used only for the purpose of\nproviding open space, park and recreational areas, but shall not be so restricted should the Town\ndecide to sell such land as provided by the following paragraph.\n9.\nSale by Town. The Town shall have the right to sell any land dedicated to the Town for park and\nrecreation purposes on finding by the Planning Board and the Town Council that a particular piece of\nproperty is not feasible or incompatible with the Town's Parks and Recreation Master Plan.\n10.\nUse of Funds Received in Lieu of Dedication. Fees collected in lieu of dedications and any proceeds\nfrom such transactions or sales shall be held in a special fund by the Town, and the funds shall be\nused by the Town for the purpose of acquiring or developing recreation, parks, greenways, or open\nspace areas as shown in the Parks and Recreation Master Plan or the Comprehensive Bicycle,\nPedestrian, and Greenway Plan, and for no other purposes.\n11.\nDisagreements between Town and Subdivider.\na.\nIn the event that the Town and the subdivider of land cannot agree upon the location, terrain,\nsize, or shape of the land necessary to be dedicated for parks and public open space, or cannot\nagree upon the details of provisions for an equitable amount of land in another location, or where\nthere is any disagreement between the Town and the subdivider, including the amount of the fee\nin lieu of land, such disagreement shall be determined by the Parks and Recreation Advisory\nBoard.\nb.\nThe Board shall view the land and hear the contentions of both the Town and the subdivider.

The Preliminary Plat shall be valid for the period prescribed by Section 145.01.14,\nDevelopment Review Summary. The Planning and Zoning Board may approve a staging plan\nextending the effective period of the Preliminary Plat approval for more than two years where it is the\nintent of the landowners to proceed to Final Plats covering only a portion of the tract at any one time.\nE.\nPhasing Of A Preliminary Plat. Whenever a subdivider applies for approval of a Final Plat which contains\nonly a portion of the land encompassed in the approved Preliminary Plat, the Final Plat shall coincide with\nphase lines as established on the Preliminary Plat. Phasing of a Preliminary Plat shall not be permitted\nunless the phase lines are established and approved under the action of the Planning and Zoning Board.\nF.\nFinal Plat Submission Procedures For Major Plats.\n1.\nFinal Plat Required. There shall be a Final Plat approved prior to development for each subdivision\nwhich receives Preliminary Plat approval.\n2.\nRecordation. No Final Plat shall be recorded until a Final Plat has been approved as provided in this\nSection.\n3.\nPhasing. The subdivider may submit Final Plat copies for only that portion of the approved Preliminary\nPlat which is proposed for recordation and development at that time, if such portion conforms to all\nrequirements of this Article. The Final Plat shall conform to the approved Preliminary Plat. Any\ndeviation from the approved Preliminary Plat which does not constitute a Minor Modification as set\nforth in 145.02.14, shall require additional review and final action by the Planning and Zoning Board.\n4.\nFinal Action. The Final Plat and related materials shall be approved or disapproved by the Director\nwithin 15 days. Approval shall be in the form of a written letter to the subdivider (or contact person as\nlisted on application) advising that the final plat meets all Town and state requirements and that the\noriginal of the Final Plat may be submitted to the Director. The Director shall sign the plat.

To implement the provisions of NCGS 160D-108 and 160D-108.1.\nB.\nTypes of Nonconformities. There are five general types of nonconformities addressed in this Section.\n1.\nNonconforming Uses. The following uses are nonconforming uses:\na.\nUses that were lawfully established but are not currently listed as permitted or special uses;\nb.\nUses that do not meet the requirements of \u00a7 140.04.06, Special Use Standards; and\nC.\nUses that were lawfully established within a floodplain or floodway, but are no longer permitted in\nthe floodplain or floodway.\n2.\nNonconforming Structures. The following are nonconforming structures:\na. Structures that were lawfully established but fail to meet a numerical standard in $140.02, Zoning\nDistricts and Standards; and\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 146, $146.01 - Page 1\n"}, {"page": "309", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNo\nThe right side of opportunity\nb.\nStructures that were lawfully established within a floodplain or floodway, but are no longer\npermitted due to their location or elevation within the floodplain or floodway.\n3.\nNonconforming Lots of Record. A lawfully established lot, not held in common with any other lot, that\ndoes not meet the area or other dimensional standards of this UDO, is a nonconforming lot of record.\nLots that are held in common, but which individually do not meet lot area or dimensional standards, are\ncurable nonconformities. Where a landowner owns several nonconforming lots that abut each other,\nthey may be combined to create conforming ;lots or, if full conformity is not possible, they may be\ncombined to the extent that the combination increases the degree of conformity.\n4.\nNonconforming Signs. A lawfully established sign that fails to meet the applicable requirements\nof $141.05, Signs, is a nonconforming sign.\n5.\nNonconforming Site Elements. The following site elements are nonconforming if there were lawfully\nestablished but do not meet the standards of Chapter 141, Building and Site Design.\na.\nBuilding exterior material or design,\nb.\nParking, loading, or stacking areas or driveways;\nC.\nDevelopment landscaping or bufferyards; and\nd. Outdoor lighting.\nC.\nUnlawful Uses, Structures, or Signs. This Chapter does not legalize uses, structures, or signs that were\nestablished, constructed, or modified without the required approvals. Such uses, structures, or signs are not\n\"legally nonconforming,\" but instead remain \"unlawful,\" and are violations of this UDO and any other\napplicable law. Likewise, this Chapter does not legalize unlawful subdivisions of property that may have\noccurred before the effective date of this UDO.\nD.\nNonconformities Created by Public Action. Any nonconforming structure or land expressly created or\ncaused by a conveyance of privately owned land to a federal, state, or local government to serve a public\npurpose is conforming for the purposes of this UDO, and is not subject to the limitations of this Chapter. This\nexemption applies only in cases where private land is obtained by a governmental entity for a public\npurpose, through condemnation, threat of condemnation or otherwise, which creates a nonconformity in the\nremainder parcel in terms of setback, lot size, or other applicable standards of this UDO. This exemption\ndoes not apply to right-of-way dedication or other public conveyances of land required by the Town in the\ncourse of subdivision or other routine site plan approvals.\nE.\nMaintenance and Alterations.\n1.\nMaintenance. Routine maintenance of a nonconforming structure or sign, or of a conforming structure\ncontaining a nonconforming use, is permitted, including necessary non-structural repairs, painting,\nchange in message on a sign, and incidental alterations that do not extend or intensify the\nnonconforming uses or the life of the nonconforming structures.\n2. Alterations.\na.\nNo structural alteration shall be made to any nonconforming structure or sign or to a structure\ncontaining a nonconforming use except if:\n1.\nThe alteration is required by law;\n2.\nThe alteration will result in eliminating the nonconforming use, structure, or sign; or\n3.\nThe alteration will not maintain or increase the degree of nonconformity.\nb.\nFor example, in regard to paragraph a.3, above, if a structure is set back three feet from\na property line and this UDO requires five feet, then no portion of an addition shall come closer to\nthe property line than the minimum required five feet.\nE.\nDetermination of Nonconforming Status. The initial decision as to whether an existing Nonconforming\nUse or Nonconforming Structure has been abandoned shall be made by the Director, subject to said\ndecision being appealed to the Board of Adjustment by the affected property owner within 30 days of the\nruling by the Director.\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 146, $146.01 - Page 2\n"}, {"page": "310", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNC\nThe right side of opportunity\nG. Elimination of Nonconforming Status. The owner of a nonconformity may employ the mechanisms\ndenoted in Table 146.01.01, Elimination of Nonconforming Status, in an attempt to eliminate the\nnonconformity.\n146.01.02 Nonconforming Uses\nA.\nAll Nonconforming Uses. The following shall apply to nonconforming uses.\n1.\nA nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use, except as allowed in\n$146.02, Conversion of Nonconformities.\n2.\nIf a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed.\n3.\nIf the use of only a portion of a building or property is changed from a nonconforming use to a\nconforming use, then the use of that portion of the building or property shall not be changed back to the\nnonconforming use.\nB.\nDamage and Restoration of Structure Housing Nonconforming Use. Any conforming structure housing\na nonconforming use that is damaged by any means to an extent exceeding 50 percent of its replacement\ncost shall comply with the use standards of this UDO when it is re-constructed. Any conforming structure\nhousing a nonconforming use that is damaged by any means to a lesser extent may continue the\nnonconforming use if it is reconstructed and used as before within two years of the damage.\nC.\nNonconforming Temporary Uses. Certain nonconforming uses, due to their individual temporary\ncircumstances, cannot be maintained as a year-round use. These uses, which are identified in $140.04.08,\nTemporary Use and Structure Standards, shall be considered abandoned if the temporary use is\ndiscontinued for longer than any 12 month period.\nD.\nNonconforming Bona Fide Farms or Agri-Businesses. Existing bona fide farms or agri-businesses in the\nAG zoning district may be operated on a property so designated by Cabarrus County or Rowan County as of\nthe time of the effective date of this UDO. Such farms or agri-businesses may continue in their current state\nand with their existing level of activity in accordance with the following:\n1.\nExpansion. Such farms or agri-businesses shall be permitted to expand to the maximum extent\npermitted under the requirements of this district on the same property or adjacent property (also having\nthe bona fide farm designations).\n2.\nNon-Bona Fide Designation. New or expanded agri-business operations on property not having a bona\nfide farm designation shall not be permitted.\n3.\nContinuance. Bona-fide farms which cease to qualify as such may return to active farming and may\ncontinue as farms as if they had never ceased operating. However, once a bona fide farm ceases to\nqualify as such, and the property is developed for other non-farm uses permitted in the AG district, it\nmay not be re-established as a bona fide farm.\nHarrisburg, NC\nTITLE XV: Chapter 146, $146.01 - Page 3\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 146.01.01, Elimination of Nonconforming Status\nCELL (2, 1): \nNonconformity\nCELL (2, 2): \nMechanism to Eliminate Nonconforming Status\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nConversion of the existing use to a conforming use.\nCELL (4, 1): \nUse\nCELL (4, 2): \nApproval of a Zoning Map Amendment to a district in which the use is permitted.\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nApproval of a Special Use Permit in accordance with $146.02, Conversion of Nonconformities.\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nModification of the structure to conform.\nCELL (7, 1): \nStructure\nCELL (7, 2): \nApproval of a Variance to allow the structure as built.\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nApproval of a Zoning Map Amendment o district to which the structure would conform.\nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \nApproval of a Special Use Permit in accordance with $146.02, Conversion of Nonconformities.\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \nModification of the sign to conform.\nCELL (11, 1): \nSign\nCELL (11, 2): \nReplacement of the sign with a permitted sign type\nCELL (12, 1): \nLot of Record\nCELL (12, 2): \nApproval of a Replat.\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nCombination of properties held in common ownership to create a conforming lot.\nCELL (14, 1): \nSite Elements\nCELL (14, 2): \nModification of the improvement to conform.\n"}, {"page": "311", "text": "Code of Ordinances\nHarrisburgNC\nThe right side of opportunity\n146.01.03 Nonconforming Building or Structures\nA.\nLimitations on Nonconforming Building or Structures.\n1.\nContinuance.

This\nprovision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, generally\napplicable in the zoning district.\nB.\nLot Combination. Where a property owner owns more than one contiguous nonconforming lots, the\nlots shall be combined to create fully conforming lots prior to any other development application submittal for\nthe property. Or, if full conformity is not possible, the lots shall be combined if the combination will increase\nthe degree of conformity.\nC.\nCreation of Nonconforming Lots Prohibited. The subdivision of any land may not result in a lot area or\ndimension that does not meet the minimum standards of this UDO.\nD.\nPermitted Use. Any existing lot of record which does not conform with lot area, depth, or width requirements\nmay be used for any permitted use in that zoning district so long as the parcel is not reduced in any manner\nor diminished so as to cause yards, lot coverage, or other open spaces to be less than required, except as\nprovided in Subsection E, Dimensional Requirements, below.\nE.\nDimensional Requirements.

(Source: NCGS \u00a7 115C-75)\nElevated Building means a non-basement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground\nlevel by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.\nEnclosure Ratio means the ratio of building height to spaces in front of the building. Buildings serve to spatially\ndefine streets. Proper spatial definition is achieved with buildings or other architectural elements (including certain\ntree plantings) that make up the street edges aligned in a disciplined manner with an appropriate ratio of height to\nwidth. The condition of alignment occurs when the facades of buildings cooperate to delineate the public space, as\nwalls form a room. Building articulation must take place primarily in the vertical plane or facade. Appendages such\nas porches, balconies, and bay windows are encouraged to promote the visual transition. The condition of\nenclosure generated by the height-width ratio of the space is related to the physiology of the human eye. If the\nwidth of a public space is such that the cone of vision encompasses less street walls than the opening to the sky,\nthen the degree of spatial enclosure is slight. Ratios not exceeding 1:4 are considered optimal, while a 1:6 height-\nto-width ratio is the absolute minimum required for appropriate urban spatial definition. See P. Craighead, ed., The\nHidden Design in Land Use Ordinances (University of Southern Maine, 1991), at 45; R. Arendt, Rural by Design\n(American Planning Association, 1994), at 10-11. An appropriate average ratio is 1:3. As a general rule, the tighter\nthe ratio, the stronger the sense of place. Spatial enclosure is particularly important for shopping streets, which\nmust compete with malls which provide very effective spatial definition. In the absence of spatial definition by\nfacades, disciplined tree planting is an alternative. Trees aligned for spatial enclosure are necessary along\nthoroughfares with substantial front yards. If Streetscape Landscaping is provided in accordance with the\nLandscaping Standards of this Ordinance, the Enclosure Ratio shall be measured from the height of the trees at\nmaturity rather than the height of the buildings. For the internal streets or circulation systems of subdivision plats or\nsite plans, the Enclosure Ratio shall be computed by dividing the height of the shortest facing structure by the\nspaces between the buildings. For development on individual tracts adjoining a public right-of-way and not under\nCommon Ownership with tracts or parcels facing across the right-of-way, the Enclosure Ratio shall apply only to the\ntract or parcel subject to the Application for Development Approval. Example: A building (Building A) is 15 feet in\nheight and faces a building (Building B) 24 feet in height across a street with a 40-foot right-of-way. Building A is\nlocated 15 feet and Building B is located 20 feet from the edge of the right-of-way, producing a building-to-building\nspace of 75 feet. The enclosure ratio is 1:5 (15 75 = 1:5).
