Application of Density Credits\n1.\nThe usage of density credits shall be applicable on a particular tract only if approved by\nthe Town Council.\n2. The amount of density credits granted by the Town Council shall be computed as\nfollows.\n(a) If the tract(s) which abuts the proposed thoroughfare, or lots created from said tract\nwhich abut the thoroughfare, will be able to directly access the thoroughfare, density\ncredits will be computed only for that area of land dedicated (per the Thoroughfare\nPlan) which is in excess of that which would normally be required to be dedicated as\ncalled for in the Stanley Subdivision Regulations Ordinance.\nIrrespective of the above, the Stanley Town Council shall have the authority to issue\ndensity credits based on the full right-of-way width, having determined that the\nproposed road location will significantly aid in the flow of traffic both in the\nimmediate vicinity and throughout the community.\n(b) If the tract(s) which abuts the proposed thoroughfare, or lots created from said tract\nwhich abut the thoroughfare, are not permitted access or are otherwise unable to\naccess the thoroughfare, density credits are to be calculated using the full-width of the\nright-of-way dedication area.\n3. The result of the application of density credits shall be to allow for a level intensity of\ndevelopment above that which would normally be allowed in the underlying general\nzoning district and the creation of lots which may be smaller in area that otherwise called\nfor in the underlying zoning district.\nE. Density Credit Calculations\nThe following formulae shall be used in calculating the additional amount of development\nallowed using density credits:\n1. Single-Family (including lots containing individual manufactured homes) and Two-\nFamily lots.\nThe density credit bonus is derived by dividing the area dedicated for thoroughfare right-\nof-way purposes (A1) or (A2) by the area of the entire tract and then multiplied by 100\n((A1 or A2) B X 100).

The site specific\ndevelopment plan shall be considered complete if submitted with a fee (in accordance with a fee\nschedule adopted by the Town Council) and accompanied with all information required for the\nsubmittal of a special use permit application.\nC. Planning Board Review\nThe Planning Board shall have a maximum of thirty-one (31) days from date it initially met to\nreview the application to submit a recommendation to the Town Council. The Planning Board\nmay at any time during this period, require additional information to evaluate an application.\nShould such information be requested, the review period shall not resume being counted until\nsuch information is presented to the Planning Board. If no recommendation is made to the Town\nCouncil after the end of the thirty-one (31) day review period, the application shall be forwarded\nto the Town Council without a recommendation.\nD. Evidentiary Hearing\nOnce a recommendation is received from the Planning Board (or the thirty-one-day period\nexpires without a recommendation), the Town Council shall conduct a evidentiary hearing on the\napplication. Notice of the evidentiary hearing shall be given as follows:\n1. A notice shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the Stanley area\nonce a week, for two (2) successive weeks, the first notice to be published not less than\nStanley\nTown of Stanley Zoning Ordinance\n9-20\nNORTH CAROLINA\nFriendly Place\n"}, {"page": "78", "text": "Application of Regulations\n9-21\nten (10) days nor more than twenty-five (25) days prior to the date established for the\nevidentiary hearing.\n2. A notice of the evidentiary hearing shall be sent by first class mail by the Zoning\nEnforcement Officer (or agent) to all contiguous property owners at least ten (10) days\nprior to the evidentiary hearing.\nE. Town Council Action\nOnce the evidentiary hearing has been held, the Town Council shall determine whether or not to\napprove the site-specific development plan and accord the vested right. In approving an\napplication for vested right of a site-specific development plan, the Town Council may attach\nfair and reasonable conditions to the approval, such conditions being necessary to protect the\npublic's health, safety and welfare. The petitioner shall be given reasonable opportunity to\nconsider and respond to any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the Town\nCouncil. The Town Council may not require the landowner to waive his vested right as a\ncondition of developmental approval.\nThe Town Council may approve the site-specific development plan if it has evaluated an\napplication and determined that:\n1. The use meets all required specifications of the zoning ordinance;\n2. The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety and will not substantially\ninjure the value of adjoining property if located where proposed; and\n3. If the site-specific development plan is vested for a period of greater than two (2) years,\nthis shall be based on one or more factors SO described in Section (F).\nThe burden of proof of producing evidence to support these findings (and to overcome any\nchallenges that approval of the site plan would be contrary to one or more of these findings) shall\nrest entirely with the landowner.\nIf the use or development for which the site-specific development plan is submitted is a special\nuse, the Town Council may approve the site-specific development plan contemporaneously with\nthe approval of the special use permit. In no case, however, may a site-specific development plan\nbe approved for a use or development which requires the issuance of a special use permit without\nthe special use permit having first been issued.\nF.

The vesting of any site plan beyond a two (2) year period may only be\nauthorized by the Town Council where it is found that due to the size or magnitude of the\nproposed development a two-year vesting period would not be sufficient time for the landowner\nto commence the project.

Compensation is made by the Town to the landowner for all costs, expenses, and other\nlosses incurred including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing,\nand all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and any other consultant's fees incurred\nafter approval together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid; or,\n4.\nThe Town determines, after having advertised and held an evidentiary hearing (as\nprovided for in Section 9.33 D), that the landowner or his representative intentionally\nsupplied inaccurate information or added material misrepresentations which made a\ndifference in the approval by the Town of the site-specific development plan; or,\n5.

Revocation or Expiration of a Vested Right\nThe vested right resulting from the approval of a site-specific development plan may be revoked\nby the Town Council as provided for in Section (F). In addition, a revocation may occur if the\nTown Council determines that the landowner has failed to comply with the terms and conditions\nof the approval or with any other applicable portion of the Zoning Ordinance.\nThe vested right granted to the landowner shall automatically terminate two (2) years from the\ndate of the approval of the site-specific development plan (unless a longer vesting period was\npreviously approved by the Town council).

Amendments to the Zoning Ordinance\nThe establishment of a vested right on a piece of property for a site-specific development plan\nshall not preclude the Town from establishing and putting into place one or more overlay\ndistricts which may impose additional restrictions on said property, provided such restrictions do\nnot affect the allowable type of intensity or use.

These uses generally seek outlying locations on large tracts of land where\nthe operations involved do not detract from the development potential of nearby undeveloped\nproperties.
