Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot\nlines, or town, city, or county borders, such lines shall be construed to be said\ndistrict boundaries, unless otherwise indicated.\n3.\nWhere district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel\nto the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or rights-of-way of same,\nsuch district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such\ndistance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is shown,\nsuch distance shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Official\nZoning Maps.\n4. Where a district boundary line divides a single lot, each part of the lot shall be\nused in conformity with the standards established by these regulations for the\ndistrict in which that part is located.\n5. Zoning district boundaries are automatically amended to remain consistent with\nthe boundaries of the Zoning Maps incorporated herein by reference pursuant to\nSection 1.5. If, because of error or omission in the maps, any property within the\njurisdiction of this ordinance is not shown as being in a zoning district, such\nproperty will be classified as TRANSITIONAL until changed by amendment.\nPage 20\nCELL (1, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nClassification\nCELL (2, 1): \nMH-O\nCELL (2, 2): \nManufactured Home Overlay District\nCELL (2, 3): \nResidential\nCELL (3, 1): \nMIL-O\nCELL (3, 2): \nMountain Island Lake Watershed Overlay\nDistrict\nCELL (3, 3): \nEnvironmental Protection\nCELL (4, 1): \nLN-O\nCELL (4, 2): \nLake Norman Watershed Overlay District\nCELL (4, 3): \nEnvironmental Protection\n"}, {"page": "21", "text": "6.

In Huntersville, public streets are designed\nwith the land uses adjacent to the street to safely accommodate mobility, access, and\ntravel for all users. All streets should connect to help create a comprehensive network\nof public areas to allow movement of automobiles, transit vehicles, bicyclists, and\npedestrians. All elements of community design must be incorporated with the design of\nthe street network to promote motorized speeds that are appropriate to their context.\nThe processes described in this Article in conjunction with the Town's Engineering\nStandards and Procedures Manual shall be used for the design of all public streets in\nthe Town's jurisdiction, which includes both the Town corporate limits and the\nExtraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction (ETJ).\nStreets shall:\n1. Incorporate appropriate accommodations for all modes of transportation\nincluding, vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users, and may include\nuser amenities such as shelters, benches, and bike racks.\n2. Interconnect within a development and with adjoining development. Cul-de-sac\nstreets may be allowed only where topographical and/or adjacent development\noffer no practical alternatives for connections or through traffic. Street stubs shall\nbe provided within developments adjacent to vacant land or land suitable for\nredevelopment, wherever possible, to provide for future connections. The Land\nDevelopment Map, Huntersville Community Plan and any applicable Small\nArea Plans should be reviewed to locate potential connections in new\nneighborhoods.\n3. Be bordered by sidewalks on both sides, with the exception of ditch-type local\nstreets, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of parkways (see Article 7.11).\nSidewalks on one side of the road may be permitted in the Rural zone as an\nincentive to protect water quality.\n4. Be lined with street trees on both sides, with the exception of ditch-type local\nstreets, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of parkways (see Article 7.11).\nPage 146\n"}, {"page": "147", "text": "5.

Generally, all buildings will front on public streets.\n5.2 Blocks, Intersections, And Traffic Calming\n(a) Blocks. Street blocks defined by public streets are the foundation of traditional\nneighborhoods. Block dimensions are as follows:\nThe block pattern should continue to establish the development pattern at the\nproject edge. Where a longer block will reduce the number of railroad grade\ncrossings, major stream crossings, or where longer blocks will result in an\narrangement of street connections, lots and public space that comply with this\nArticle and Article 7 of these regulations, the Planning Staff may authorize up to\n30% greater block lengths at the time of subdivision sketch plan review and\napproval. Any block length extension beyond 30% shall be processed as a\nsubdivision variance in accordance with 4.000 of the Subdivision Ordinance.\n(b) Intersections. Segments of straight streets should be interrupted by\nintersections designed to:\n1. Disperse traffic flow and reduce speeds, thereby eliminating the creation\nof de facto collector streets with high speed, high volume traffic; and\n2. Terminate vistas with a significant natural feature, a building, a small\npark, or other public space.\nLandmark\nPage 147\nCELL (1, 1): \nNew Development Type\nCELL (1, 2): \nLinear feet as measured between\ncross streets\nCELL (2, 1): \nUrban Conditions\nCELL (2, 2): \n250 to 500 feet\nCELL (3, 1): \nMajor Residential Subdivisions\nCELL (3, 2): \nNot to exceed 800 feet\nCELL (4, 1): \nLarge Lot Subdivisions/Industrial\nAreas\nCELL (4, 2): \nNot to exceed 1500 feet\n"}, {"page": "148", "text": "(c) Traffic Calming.

Proper alignment and delineation of the public street space occurs when\nthe facades of adjacent buildings are aligned much like the walls forming a room.\nBuildings that make up the street edges are aligned in a disciplined manner. The\ndefined space observes a certain ratio of height to width.\nBuilding articulation must take place primarily in the vertical plane of the fa\u00e7ade.\nAppendages such as porches, balconies, and bay windows are encouraged to promote\nthe transition between the public street and the private dwelling.\nFor good definition, the ratio of one increment of height to six of width is the absolute\nmaximum, with one to three being a good effective minimum. As a general rule, the\ntighter the ratio, the stronger the sense of place. Very tight relationships of one to one\ncan create special pedestrian places.\nIn the absence of spatial definition by facades, disciplined tree planting is an\nalternative. Trees aligned for spatial enclosure are necessary on streets with deep\nbuilding setbacks.\nSPECIAL\nMINIMUM\nRATIO 1:1\nRATIO 1:3\nMAXIMUM\nBY FACADE\nBY RECESS LINE\nRATIO 1:6\nBY LANDSCAPING\nPROPORTIONS\nTECHNIQUES\n5.5 Street Design Specifications\nPage 148\n"}, {"page": "149", "text": "Design should permit comfortable use of the street by motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists,\nand transit users.

What is the intensity and type of land use at\npresent? What building type(s), massing and exterior features are common\nbetween the existing developments? Is there a Small Area Plan for the district?\nWhat does it involve and advise? Are there other adopted plans that are\napplicable?\nStep 2: Define the Transportation Context. Identify the transportation network\nthat will influence the street design. What is the nature of the surrounding street\nnetwork? Does the street cater to the multi-modal design philosophy? What are the\nincorporated street elements (lanes, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, traffic-calming\ndevices, landscaping)? Are transportation improvements expected for the area?\nStep 3: Establish Goals and Objectives. Consider the issues and opportunities of\nthe context (land use and transportation) and their impact on the design of the street\nnetwork in order to develop goal sets for all users.\nStep 4: Prioritize Goals. What components are acceptable and what should be\nmodified? Do the stakeholders and larger community prefer the street network and\nneighborhood to change or remain the same? How would the stakeholders and\nlarger community prefer the street network and neighborhood to change?\nStep 5: Develop Alternatives. Research and test the most suitable street type and\nits elements using this Article. Identify the site-specific constraints (right-of-way,\nexisting features, environmental features, topography, etc.).\nStep 6: Recommend Alternatives. Apply the appropriate street cross-section in\nthe Town of Huntersville Engineering and Standards and Procedure Manual.\nReconfigure the cross-section according to the context-based analysis in Steps 1\nand 2 to meet goals established in Step 4 and accommodate the site-specific\nconstraints listed in Step 5.\nElements of Street Design.

Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings; side of the building parking will\nbe permitted only as indicated by Building Type and shall be measured along\nthe build-to line. Off-street parking is not permitted in front of the primary building\nfacade, except where specified in an adopted street section, detailed as a public\nplaza, or associated with a golf clubhouse and located a minimum of 800 feet\nfrom designated thoroughfare(s).\nB.\nUninterrupted areas of parking lot shall be limited in size. Large parking lots\nshall be broken by buildings and/or landscape features.\nC. Parking lots are to be treated as enclosed rooms for cars, with enclosure\nprovided by tree planting and/or building walls(s). For small lots (thirty-six\nspaces or less), landscaping shall be required at the perimeter; for large lots\n(more than thirty-six spaces), landscaping shall be at the perimeter and placed\nto break the lot into parking modules of no more than thirty-six spaces. See\ndiagram on following page.\nD. Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their\nvehicles to the building. On small lots, this may be achieved by providing a\nsidewalk at the perimeter of the lot. On larger lots, corridors within the parking\narea should channel pedestrians from the car to the perimeter of the lot or to the\nbuilding. These corridors may be delineated by a paving material which differs\nfrom that of vehicular areas and planted to provide shade. Small posts or\nbollards may be included.\nE.

For the purposes of identification\nand preservation, a site analysis by a North Carolina Landscape\nArchitect, Engineer, or other professional approved by staff is required for\nall development. The site analysis shall be submitted to planning staff\nprior to sketch plan review and prior to any clearing. The developer\nand/or the design firm shall review plans with staff to determine the best\nareas for potential tree save. Refer to Section 6.0 of the Subdivision\nOrdinance for all site analysis requirements.\nCELL (3, 1): \nC. Method for Calculating Existing Tree Save and Proposed Tree Save\nCELL (3, 2): \nC. Method for Calculating Existing Tree Save and Proposed Tree Save\nAreas. Existing tree save area shall be considered the area in which the\ndrip line of the existing tree or trees is located on the property plus an\nadditional 5 feet around the perimeter, prior to development. Proposed\ntree save area shall be considered the area in which the drip line of the\nremaining tree or trees is located on the property plus an additional 5\nfeet around the perimeter after development.

The following characteristics shall be considered when selecting\ntrees to be protected and saved:\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \n(1) Tree vigor. Healthy trees shall be preserved. A tree of low vigor is\nsusceptible to damage by environmental changes that occur\nduring site development. Healthy trees are less susceptible to\ninsects and disease. Indications of poor vigor include dead tips of\nbranches, small annual twig growth, stunted leaf size, sparse\nfoliage, and pale foliage color. Hollow or rotten trees; cracked,\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "split, or leaning trees; or trees with broken tips also have less\nchance of survival.\n(2) Tree age. Old, picturesque trees may be more aesthetically\nvaluable than smaller, younger trees, but they may require more\nextensive protection.\n(3) Tree species. Preserve those species that are most suitable for\nsite conditions and landscape design. Tree species that are short\nlived or brittle or are susceptible to attack by insects and disease\nare poor choices for preservation.\n(4) Tree aesthetics. Choose trees that are aesthetically pleasing,\nshapely, large, or colorful. Avoid trees that are leaning or in\ndanger of falling. Occasionally, an odd shaped tree or one of\nunusual form may add interest to the landscape if strategically\nlocated; however, be certain that the tree is healthy.\n(5) Wildlife benefits. Choose trees that are preferred by wildlife for\nfood, cover, or nesting. A mixture of evergreens and hardwoods\nmay be beneficial. Evergreen trees are important for cover during\nthe winter months, whereas hardwoods are more valuable for\nfood.\n(6) Environmental benefits. Choose trees that help to reduce runoff\nand erosion, disconnect impervious areas, serve as stormwater\nfilters, and/or buffer onsite perennial streams.\ne. Tree Save Delineation. All trees save areas must be specified on the\nrecorded plat, individual recorded deeds, and all property association\ndocuments for land held in common.\nf. Tree Preservation Requirements. Tree preservation areas (tree save)\nshall be determined once a site analysis plan has been completed\ndemonstrating the amount of existing tree canopy on a site and\nidentifying specific locations of all heritage and specimen trees. The\npercentages listed below are based on existing trees as established\nabove under Method for Calculating Existing and Proposed Tree Save\nArea (7.4.2 C).

Encroachment. If encroachment into a required Tree Save/Preservation\nArea occurs which causes irreparable damage to trees, the Tree\nPreservation and/or Replacement Plan shall be revised to compensate\nfor the loss. Encroachments shall be subject to the penalties listed in\nArticle 7.9. Encroachments, damage, and removal of vegetation in a tree\nsave/preservation area shall result in replanting in accordance with\nArticle 7.4.5.\n4. Tree Removal. A Land Disturbing Permit is required. Land disturbing activities\nshall not commence until such activities have been authorized by issuance of a\nvalid Land Disturbing Permit as specified under the provisions of the Land\nDevelopment Standards Manual and Erosion and Sedimentation Control\nManual.\n5. Mitigation. If a required tree save/preservation area or required undisturbed\nbuffer yard is disturbed for any reason, it shall be restored at a rate of 5 trees per\n1,000 square feet. Trees to be planted shall have a minimum caliper of 2 inches,\nshall be 8-10 feet in height at installation, and shall be at least 75% large\nmaturing hardwood varieties. Where a disturbed area also functioned to buffer\nadjacent properties or public street(s), at least 50% of the trees shall be\nevergreen varieties. Trees shall be distributed throughout the disturbed area in\nsuch a way as to effectively replace the vegetation disturbed. Where under story\nvegetation is removed or disturbed it shall be replaced at a rate of 20 shrubs per\n1,000 square feet. Shrubs shall be evergreen and 3 feet in height when installed\nand are expected to reach a minimum height of 6 feet at maturity. When a tree is\ndestroyed due to an act of God, it shall be replaced with the same species or\nPage 167\n"}, {"page": "168", "text": "comparable species, 2 inch in caliper in size. A planting plan is required for staff\nreview and approval prior to planting.\n7.5 Buffer Yards\n.1 Purpose. The general purpose of buffer yards is to establish regulations protecting\nand preserving the appearance, character, and value of property within the town. The\nobjectives are to exclude visual contact, create spatial separation and to minimize any\nadverse impacts on adjacent properties. Where topographical changes, the size and\nshape of existing lots of record, or other spatial conditions exist which would make\nadherence to the basic requirement either impossible or ineffective in meeting the\npurpose of the buffer yard, alternate buffer yard plans will be considered or may be\nrequired. These provisions shall not apply to developments in the Town Center (TC),\nTransit Oriented Development - Residential (TOD-R), and Transit Oriented\nDevelopment - Employment (TOD-E) zoning districts.\n.2 Applicability. All applicable development plans shall comply with the provisions of\nthis section. A change of use, expansion of existing heated square footage of a\nbuilding, or and expansion of parking and loading areas will require compliance with\nthese provisions as prescribed per Article 11.5.6, Non-conforming landscaping and\nscreening.\n.3 Function. A buffer yard shall function as an opaque or semi-opaque barrier between\nthe viewer and the use or structure to be buffered. Therefore, the exact location and\narrangement of materials in the buffer yard will be determined based upon an analysis\nof site topography and sight lines from public spaces or private properties, which are to\nbe protected. The density of the buffer yard is determined by the intensity of the use and\nthe zoning district.

Such an alteration may occur only at the request of the property owner, who\nshall submit a plan to the Plan Reviewer showing existing site features that would\nbuffer the proposed use and any additional buffer yard materials the property owner will\nplant or construct to buffer the proposed use. The Plan Reviewer shall not alter the\nrequirements of the buffer yard unless the developer demonstrates that existing features\nand any additional buffer yard materials will buffer the proposed use as effectively as\nthe required buffer yard. In deciding whether to approve such a plan, the Plan Reviewer\nshall consult with the Zoning Inspector.

To achieve this, the majority of houselots\nshould abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access.\nSafe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not\nadjoining the open space shall be provided (except in the case of farmland, or\nother resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance).\nWhere the undivided open space is designated as separate, non-contiguous\nparcels, no parcel should have a length-to-width ratio in excess of 4:1, except\nsuch areas that are specifically designed as village greens, ballfields, upland\nbuffers to wetlands, waterbodies or watercourses, or designed as trail links.\n6. Interconnected Open Space Network: As these policies are implemented, the\nprotected open space in each new subdivision will eventually adjoin each other,\nultimately forming an inter-connected network of open across the town and\nadjoining communities. To avoid the issue of the \"taking of land without\ncompensation\", the only elements of this network that would necessarily be\nopen to the public are those lands that have been required to be dedicated for\npublic use.\n7.13 Open Space Evaluation Criteria\n1. In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be\nconsidered by the town as indicating design appropriate to the site's natural,\nhistoric, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this ordinance.\nDiversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best\npossible relationship between development and conservation areas. Reference\nSubdivision Ordinance 6.300. Accordingly, the town shall evaluate proposals to\ndetermine whether the proposed subdivision plan:\na. Protects and preserves all floodways, and wetlands.\nb. Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures,\nmeadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize\nconflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example,\nlocating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally\nrecommended, with two exceptions. The first involves significant wildlife\nhabitat or mature woodlands which raise an equal or greater\npreservation concern, as described in \"e\" and \"h\" below. The second\ninvolves predominantly agricultural areas, where remnant tree groups\nprovide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat.\nC. If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of\ngreater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited\non the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a\nfield, as seen from existing public roads. Other considerations include\nPage 189\n"}, {"page": "190", "text": "whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public\nroads, such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous\nnative trees, shrubs and wildflowers (specifications for which should be\nbased upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of\nthose species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow).\nd. Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species\nvegetation adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks,\nstreams, springs, lakes and ponds.\ne. Designs around existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields or\nmeadows. Minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than five\nacres), especially those containing many mature trees or a significant\nwildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines. However,\nwoodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can\nprovide suitable locations for residential development. When any\nwoodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed\nareas (for buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal fields, etc.) in locations\nwhere there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest\nextent that is practicable.\nf. Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly\nas seen from public roadways. For example, in open agrarian\nlandscapes, a deep \"no-build, no plant\" buffer is recommended along the\npublic roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally\nsignificant. In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature\nthat should be maintained, a deep \"no-build, no-cut\" buffer should be\nrespected, to preserve existing vegetation.\ng. Avoids siting new construction on prominent ridges by taking advantage\nof lower topographic features.\nh. Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered,\nthreatened, or of special concern by the US Environmental Protection\nAgency and/or by the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health\nand Natural Resources.\ni. Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological or\ncultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the\ncharacter of the feature, including spring houses, barn foundations, cellar\nholes, earthworks, burial grounds, etc.\nj. Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and\nvehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto\nexisting public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor\nof rural roads with historic buildings, hedgerows, etc.\nk. Landscapes common areas such as cul-de-sac islands, and both sides\nof new streets with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs\nPage 190\n"}, {"page": "191", "text": "providing high wildlife conservation value listed on the approved tree\nand shrub list.\nI. Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering\nconvenient access by residents, and adequately screened from nearby\nhouselots.\nm. Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that\npedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties\nand activities or special features within the neighborhood open space\nsystem. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which\nin turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped\nparcels (or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels,\nwhere applicable).\nn. Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous. For example,\nfragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource\nareas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various\nparts of the development. To the greatest extent practicable, this land\nshall be designed as a single block with logical, straightforward\nboundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided,\nunless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is\nnecessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open space shall\ngenerally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels,\nand shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated\ngreenway systems.\n7.14 Ownership Of Open Space\n1. Open space may be owned or administered by one or a combination of the\nfollowing methods: fee simple ownership by a unit of government or private\nnon-\nprofit land conservancy; owned by a homeowners association; or by individual\nprivate ownership such as a farmer, developer or other private entity that\nmaintains the open space (i.e. farming, equestrian facility, etc.).\nPage 191\n"}, {"page": "192", "text": "ARTICLE 8 GENERAL PROVISIONS\n8.0 Applicability\n8.1 Street Frontage Required\n8.2 One Principal Building On A Lot; Exceptions\n8.3 Lot Size\n8.4 Yard Designation\n8.5 Yard Dimensions For Corner Lots\n8.6 Through Lots\n8.7 Height Limitation\n8.8 Structures And Uses Limited In Yards\n8.9 Clear Sight Triangle At Street Intersection\n8.10 Building Separation\n8.11 Permitted Accessory Uses In All Districts\n8.12 Standards For Construction; Developer Responsibility\n8.13 Regulation Of Nuisances\n8.14 General Standards For Driveway Permitting\n8.15 Special Requirements For Lots Along Thoroughfares\n8.16 Standards For Residential Lot Widths, Alleys, Garages And Parking In Residential,\nDistricts\n8.17 Water Quality\n8.18 Flags\n8.19 - 8.24 (Reserved)\n8.25 SWIM (Surface Water Improvement And Management) Stream Buffers\n8.26 Site Lighting\n8.27 Street Lighting\n8.0 Applicability\nNo structure shall be erected nor use established in conflict with:\nthe district regulations of Article 3,\nthe building and lot regulations of Article 4,\nthe street regulations of Article 5,\nthe off-street parking regulations of Article 6,\nthe landscape and open space regulations of Article 7,\nthe general provisions of Article 8, or\nthe sign regulations of Article 10.\nIn accordance with N.C.G.S 160D-702, requirements that street and utility rights-of-way\nbe dedicated to the public, that provision be made of recreational space and facilities,\nPage 192\n"}, {"page": "193", "text": "and that performance guarantees be provided, all to the same extent and with the same\nlimitations as provided for in G.S. 160D-804 and G.S. 160D-804.1\n8.1 Street Frontage Required\nAny lot on which a building (or buildings) is to be erected or use is to be established\nshall abut a public street with the following exceptions:\n1.

For detention basins, the\ntemporary storage capacity shall be restored within 72 hours.\nRequirements of the Dam Safety Act shall be met when\napplicable.\n13. Low Impact Development (LID) Approach. The Low Impact Development\n(LID) Approach is a technology-based system for managing urban storm water\nrunoff that combines a hydrological functional site design with pollution\nprevention measures to compensate for land development impacts on hydrology\nand water quality. To be effective, the LID Approach must be applied to every\nphase of site planning, design, development and post-construction control for\nthe purpose of mimicking predevelopment site hydrology by storing, infiltrating,\nevaporating and detaining storm water runoff. Examples of the LID Approach\ninclude reducing impervious surfaces, managing storm water closer to the\nsource and avoiding large centralized management devices, phased grading,\nand vegetated conveyances instead of storm drain piping. The principal goal\nof\nthe LID Approach is to ensure maximum protection of the ecological integrity of\nthe receiving waters by maintaining the watershed's hydrologic regime. In\ncontrast, the conventional approach to storm water management seeks to alter\nPage 216\n"}, {"page": "217", "text": "the watershed's hydrologic regime by conveying runoff into a piping system and\ncentralized storm water management devices to quickly and efficiently remove\nstorm water from the development site. Most development practices follow this\nconventional approach to storm water management. The use of the LID\nApproach is not required by this ordinance but is strongly encouraged. One of\nthe post-construction components of the LID Approach is the LID BMP, which is\na single structural device that utilizes the LID principles of infiltration,\nevaporation, retention and detention as well as biological and physical\nprocesses to treat storm water runoff. The use of LID BMPs is required by this\nordinance unless mitigation practices are approved and implemented. The\npurpose of this Section of the ordinance is to encourage the use of the LID\nApproach along with LID BMPs, which is most effective and efficient\ncombination for managing storm water runoff and facilitating compliance with\nthe Purpose of this ordinance as described in Section 8.17.1. The LID Approach\nand LID BMPs are further defined and explained in the Huntersville Water\nQuality Design Manual.\n14. Standards for Storm Water Control Measures.\na. Evaluation According to Contents of Huntersville Water Quality\nDesign Manual. All storm water BMPs required under this ordinance\nshall be evaluated by the Storm Water Administrator according to the\npolicies, criteria, and information, including technical specifications,\nstandards and the specific design criteria for each BMP contained in the\nHuntersville Water Quality Design Manual. The Storm Water\nAdministrator shall determine whether these measures will be adequate\nto meet the requirements of this ordinance.\nb. Determination of Adequacy. BMPs that are designed, constructed, and\nmaintained in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the\nHuntersville Water Quality Design Manual will be presumed to meet the\nminimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this\nordinance. Whenever an applicant proposes to utilize a practice or\npractices not designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria\nand specifications in the Huntersville Water Quality Design Manual, the\napplicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the practice(s) will\nsatisfy the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of\nthis ordinance before it can be approved for use. The Storm Water\nAdministrator may require the applicant to provide such documentation,\ncalculations, and examples as necessary for the Storm Water\nAdministrator to determine whether such an affirmative showing is made.\nC. Submittal of Digital Records. Upon submittal of as-built surveys, the\nlocation of storm drainage pipes, inlets and outlets as well as the\nlocation of all structural BMPs must be delivered to the Storm Water\nAdministrator in the digital format specified in the Administrative Manual.\nPage 217\n"}, {"page": "218", "text": "15.

Purpose. The purpose of a stream buffer network is to filter pollutants, store\nfloodwaters, provide habitat, and contribute to the \"green infrastructure\". Stream\nsystems are comprised of each stream and its respective drainage basin.\na. Streams have the primary natural functions of conveying storm and\nground water, storing floodwater, and supporting aquatic life.\nPage 235\nCELL (1, 1): \nVertical Pole Height\nCELL (1, 2): \nMaximum Flag Size (total square feet)\nCELL (2, 1): \n15 to 24 feet\nCELL (2, 2): \n20 square feet\nCELL (3, 1): \n25 to 34 feet\nCELL (3, 2): \n50 square feet\nCELL (4, 1): \n35 to 44 feet\nCELL (4, 2): \n100 square feet\nCELL (5, 1): \n45 to 54 feet\nCELL (5, 2): \n160 square feet\n"}, {"page": "236", "text": "b. Vegetated lands adjacent to the stream channel in the drainage basin\nserve as \"buffers\" to protect the stream's ability to fulfill its natural\nfunctions. Buffers have the primary natural functions of protecting water\nquality by filtering pollutants, providing intermittent storage for\nfloodwaters, allowing channels to meander naturally, and providing\nsuitable habitat for wildlife.\n2. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following words and phrases\nshall be defined as specified below:\nBest Management Practices (BMPs). A structural or nonstructural management\nbased practice used singularly or in combination to reduce non-point source\ninput to receiving waters in order to achieve water quality protection goals.\nBuffer. A vegetated area through which storm water runoff flows in a diffuse\nmanner so that the runoff does not become channelized and which provides for\ninfiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants.\nBuffer Zones. Buffer widths are measured in three (3) zones as shown below.\nThe buffer width is measured horizontally and must be surveyed by a licensed\nland surveyor on a line parallel to the surface water, landward from the top of the\nbank on each side of the stream.\nThree Zoned Urban Stream Buffer\nStream\nStream Side\nManaged Use\nUpland\nZone\nZone\nZone\nDrainage Basin. The area of land that drains to a given point on a body of water.\nFloodway. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land\nareas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without\ncumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than the allowable\nsurcharge (currently one foot).\nPage 236\n"}, {"page": "237", "text": "Flood Fringe. The land area located between the limits of the floodway and the\nmaximum elevation subject to inundation by the base (1% chance) flood.\nFloodplain. The low, periodically flooded lands adjacent to rivers and lakes. For\nland use planning purposes, the regulatory floodplain is usually viewed as all\nland alongside a watercourse that would be inundated by the base (1% chance)\nflood; the floodway plus the flood fringe.\nMitigation. Actions taken on-site and/or off-site to offset the effects of temporary\nor permanent loss of a buffer.\nTop of Bank. The landward edge of the stream channel during high water,\nbankfull conditions at the point where water begins to overflow onto the\nfloodplain.\n3. Applicability.\na.

Special Variance Provisions/Mitigation Techniques.\nWhen \"unnecessary hardships\", as defined in Section 11.3.2 e,\nwould result from strict adherence to the buffer width requirements and/or\nbuffer treatment standards, a petition for variance may be filed with the\nHuntersville Board of Adjustment in compliance with the procedures and\nstandards of Section 11.3.\nSite specific mitigation plans using the mitigation techniques set out\nbelow and approved by the designated agency shall be construed by the\nBoard of Adjustment to be evidence responsive to Section 11.3.2 e), 4\nconsistency with adopted plans and protection of public safety and\nwelfare. Specifications for these mitigation techniques are provided in\nthe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Buffer Implementation Guidelines (for\nStructural BMPs). The techniques below are not construed to offset the\nrequirement of Section 8.25.6 for diffuse flow.\n(1) Installation of Structural BMPs. The installation of an on-site\nstructural BMP designed to achieve specified pollutant removal\ntargets will allow for all proposed stream buffer impact on the\nspecific site. The BMP must remain outside of the Stream Side\nZone and Manage Use Zone. A detailed BMP design plan must\nbe submitted to the Mecklenburg County Land Use and\nEnvironmental Services Agency for approval based on\nspecifications contained in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg BMP\nPage 243\n"}, {"page": "244", "text": "Design Manual. This plan must also include a long-term\nmaintenance strategy for the BMP, complete with the\nestablishment of adequate financing to support the proposed\nmaintenance practices.\n(2) Stream Restoration. The owner may restore and preserve the\nbuffer area on any stream of equivalent or greater drainage area\nthe condition of which is determined to be qualified for restoration\nby the Mecklenburg County Land Use and Environmental\nServices Agency on a 1:1 basis in linear feet of stream. This\nrestoration shall include stream bank improvements and Stream\nSide and Managed Use Zone re-vegetation, in accordance with\nthe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Buffer Implementation Guidelines,\nand receive approval from the Mecklenburg County Land Use\nand Environmental Services Agency.\n(3) Stream Preservation. The owner may purchase, fee simple, other\nstream segments at equivalent or greater drainage area on a 1:1\nlinear foot basis and convey fee simple and absolute title to the\nland to the Town of Huntersville, Mecklenburg County, or\nconservation trust, with a plan approved by the Mecklenburg\nCounty Land Use and Environmental Services.\n(4) Wetlands Restoration. On a 2:1 acreage basis for disturbed\nstream and buffer area (2 acres of wetland for each acre of\ndisturbed area), the owner may provide a combination of the\npreservation and/or restoration of wetlands with protective\neasements and the implementation of structural or non-structural\nBMPs to achieve specific pollutant removal targets within the\nimpacted area. Restoration plan must be approved by the\nMecklenburg County Land Use and Environmental Services.\n(5) Bottom Land Hardwood Preservation. On a 2:1 acreage basis for\nimpacted stream and buffer area 2 acres of bottomland hardwood\nfor each acre of disturbed area), the owner may provide a\ncombination of the preservation of existing bottom land hardwood\nforest or other specifically approved natural heritage area by\nconservation easement or other legal instrument, and the\nimplementation of structural or non-structural BMPs to achieve\nspecific pollutant removal targets within the impacted area. Plan\nto be approved by Mecklenburg County Land Use and\nEnvironmental Services Agency. Bottom land hardwood\npreservation shall not include minimum tree preservation\notherwise required by these regulations (i.e. required buffers,\nrequired tree preservation of Section 7.4) but shall include any\nbottom land hardwood preserved beyond the minimums\nestablished.\nPage 244\n"}, {"page": "245", "text": "(6) Controlled Impervious Cover for Disturbance Landward of\nStream Side Zone.

The plan shall limit overall site impervious\ncover to less than or equal to 24%. Preservation of the Stream\nSide Zone is still required. Plan to be approved by Mecklenburg\nCounty Land Use and Environmental Services Agency.\n(7) Open Space Development. The submission of a site-specific\ndevelopment plan that preserves 50% of the total land area as\nundisturbed open space. Plan to be approved by Mecklenburg\nCounty Land Use and Environmental Services Agency.\n(8) Mitigation Credits: The purchase of mitigation credits through the\nStream Restoration Program on a 1:1 basis, utilizing linear feet of\nstream impacted and the prevailing rate of purchase as\nestablished by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Buffer Implementation\nGuidelines. Mitigation credits purchased under any other\nprogram (i.e., U.S. Army Corp of Engineers) shall not cover this\nrequirement unless the issuing agency agrees to relinquish the\nfunds to the appropriate local government agency.\n(9) Alternative mitigation. The list of mitigation techniques shall not\nprevent the creative development of alternative mitigation plans\nthat achieve the purposes of this section.\n12. Posting of financial security required. When structural BMPs (wet detention\nponds and other BMPs) are approved for mitigation of a buffer disturbance, the\napproval will be subject to the owner filing a surety bond or letter of credit or\nmaking other financial arrangements which are acceptable to the Mecklenburg\nCounty Land Use and Environmental Services Agency, in a form which is\nsatisfactory to the County Attorney, guaranteeing the installation and\nmaintenance of the required structural BMPs until the issuance of certificates of\noccupancy for seventy-five percent (75%) of all construction which might\nreasonably be anticipated to be built within the area which drains into the BMPs,\nallowing credit for improvements completed prior to the submission of the final\nplat. At such time that this level of occupancy is achieved, written notice thereof\nmust be submitted by the owner to the Mecklenburg County Land Use and\nEnvironmental Services Agency. The owner must also verify the adequacy of\nthe maintenance plan for the BMPs including the necessary financing to support\nthe proposed maintenance practices. The Mecklenburg County Land Use and\nEnvironmental Services Agency will inspect the structural BMPs and verify the\neffectiveness of the maintenance plan; if both are found to be satisfactory, the\ndepartment will notify the owner in writing within 30 days of the date of notice.\n13. Maintenance responsibilities for structural BMPs - Civil Penalties.\nPage 245\n"}, {"page": "246", "text": "Maintenance of all structural BMPs will be the responsibility of the property\nowner or his designee.
