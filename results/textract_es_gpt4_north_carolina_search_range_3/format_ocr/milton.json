The purpose of the CU Districts is to provide a procedure for\nconsidering the rezoning of property based upon the recogrution that certain\ntypes of zoning districts would be inappropriate at particular locations in the\nabsence of special conditions. For example, it may be that a certain lot zoned\nR-2 adjoining a C-3 area should not reasonably be expected to remain classified\nas R-2 but rezoning the lot to C-3 (with all legal uses permitted and minimum\nrequirements applicable) would only aggravate and extend a land use\nrelationship problem. It is possible, however, that if the owner of the R-2\nproperty applied for rezoning to CU-C-3 and agreed to certain development\nconditions and use limitations (stricter requirements and fewer uses than\npermitted in the C-3 District) the CUD rezoning could not only offer a\nreasonable use for the property but, also help solve a land relationship problem.\n2. Requirements within a Conditional Use District. Only those uses authorized as\npermitted in the zoning district with which the CUD corresponds shall be permitted,\nand all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, within a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to\na Conditional Use Permit authorized by the Board of Commissioners, which shall\nspecify the use or uses, authorized. Such permit may further specify the location on\nthe property of the proposed use or uses the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways and access streets,\nthe location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing\nof development, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be\ndedicated for public use, and other such matters as the applicant may propose as\nconditions upon the request, but not to include architectural review or controls or\nother conditions not generally a part of land development controls. In granting a\nConditional Use Permit the Board of Commissioners may impose such additional\nreasonable and appropriate safeguards upon such permit as it may deem necessary\nin order that the purpose and intent of this ordinance are served, public welfare\nsecured, and substantial justice done.\n35\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "MILTON\nNORTH\nCAROLINA\nTown of Milton\nSection 6.9\nOverlay Districts\nA.\nFlood Damage Prevention District\n1)\nPurpose.
