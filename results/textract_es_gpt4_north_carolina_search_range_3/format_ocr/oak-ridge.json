Provided, it shall not be necessary to\ndemonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\n(2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Provided, that\nhardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the\nneighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\n(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. Provided, that the act of purchasing\nproperty with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-\ncreated hardship.\n(4) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this chapter, such that public safety is secured, and\nsubstantial justice is achieved.\n(g) Decision.

Violations of such conditions, when a part of the terms under which the\nvariance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. A variance granted subject to a condition shall be permitted only\nso long as there is compliance with the condition. If a violation of a condition of a variance occurs, the enforcement officer may\nrevoke the certificate of occupancy. In the event that any such condition is held invalid by a court, for any reason, such holding\nshall have the effect of invalidating the variance granted and shall render the variance null and void.\n(2)\nThe board of adjustment shall grant only the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building\nor structure.\n(3)\nNeither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings, or structures in the same zoning district, nor the permitted use of lands,\nbuildings, or structures in other zoning districts, shall be considered a ground for the issuance of a variance.

Except where subsection (2)a of this section leaves the determination to the\ndeveloper, the town council shall determine the treatments to be used, based upon the pipe size necessary to handle\ndrainage and adopted open space plan. Open drainage channel requirements shall be based upon a 100-year storm, and\nenclosed systems shall be based upon a ten-year storm. If the channel is a perennial stream in a water supply watershed, or\nis identified on the open space plan map or requires a pipe of 66-inch diameter or greater, the determination of drainage\ntreatment shall be made by the town council. In making this determination, the town council shall consider the following\nfactors:\n1. The type of development;\n2. The treatment employed by nearby developments;\n3. The probability of the creation of a lengthy greenway or drainageway and open space;\n4. The probability of the creation of future maintenance problems;\n5. The probability of erosion or flooding problems;\n6. The adopted open space plan; and\n7. Stream buffer requirements and channelization limitations for GWA areas.\nb. If the channel is not a perennial stream within a GWA of a designated water supply watershed, or is not identified on the\nopen space plan and requires less than a 66-inch diameter pipe, the determination of drainage treatment shall be made by\nthe property owner in a manner consistent with this section.\n(2) Enclosed subsurface drains.\na. This section applies to enclosed subsurface drains. Profiles and enclosure standards shall be in accordance with the\njurisdictions storm sewer design manual.\nb. A utility easement designed to accommodate stormwater shall be placed on a recorded plat when determined necessary by\nthe jurisdiction.

Tree coverage serves to reduce glare, noise, air pollution, and soil erosion; to\nmoderate temperatures; to reduce stormwater runoff; to preserve remnants of the town's native ecology; to provide habitat for native plants\nand wildlife; to provide a healthy living environment; and to make the town a more attractive place to live.\n(Ord. of 7-1-2004, \u00a7 6-3.8; Ord. of 6-4-2009)\nSec. 30-993. - Tree coverage.\nAfter September 1, 2004, new development shall include tree coverage areas on a portion of the development tract. The percentage of a\ntract that shall have tree coverage is as indicated in the following table. Tree coverage standards may be met either by preserving existing trees\non the site or by planting replacement trees. Preserving existing trees on the site is preferable to a combination of preservation and planting\nand is reflected in the lower requirements.

Additionally\nthis section will help protect the water supply uses of Jordan Reservoir and of designated water supplies throughout the Jordan\nWatershed.\nBuffers adjacent to streams provide multiple environmental protection and resource management benefits. Forested buffers\nenhance and protect the natural ecology of stream systems, as well as water quality through bank stabilization, shading, and\nnutrient removal. They also help to minimize flood damage in flood-prone areas. Well-vegetated streamside riparian areas help\nto remove nitrogen and prevent sediment and sediment-bound pollutants such as phosphorous from reaching the streams.\n(3) Jurisdiction: Section 30-1222 shall be applied to all land within the Jordan Watershed, as depicted on the Jordan Lake Watershed\nStormwater Map of the Town of Oak Ridge, North Carolina.\n(4)\nApplicability: Section 30-1222 applies to all landowners and other persons conducting activities in the area described in\nsubsection 30-1222(3), with the exception of activities conducted within the Jordan Reservoir Watershed under the authority of\nthe state, the United States, multiple jurisdictions, or local units of government, and forest harvesting and agricultural activities.\nThe N.C.

There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the watershed\nrequirements, and all of the following conditions exist:\n1. If the applicant complies with the provisions of this rule, the applicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor make\nreasonable use of the subject property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit from the property\nshall not be considered adequate justification for a variance. Moreover, the EMC or stormwater administrator or designee\nshall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the rule that shall make\nreasonable use of property possible.\n2. The hardship results from the application of the rule to the property rather than from other factors such as deed\nrestrictions or other hardships.\n3. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as size, shape, or topography, which is\ndifferent from that of neighboring properties.\n4. The applicant did not cause the hardship by knowingly or unknowingly violating the rule.\n5. The applicant did not purchase the property after the effective date of the rule, and then request an appeal. The applicant\nis not precluded from a variance if a valid hardship is demonstrated.\n6. The hardship is unique to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions that are widespread. If other\nproperties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a special\nprivilege denied to others, and would not promote equal justice.\nb.
