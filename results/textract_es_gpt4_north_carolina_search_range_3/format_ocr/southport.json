This study shall also be required for projects submitted by the same\napplicant or owner within a six (6) month time period which are adjacent to or located within\n500 linear feet of one another which will collectively generate more than 500 trips per day. The\nstudy will enable the City of Southport to assess the impact of a proposed permit or\ndevelopment on the highway system when that system is at or near capacity or a safety\nproblem exists. Its purpose is to ensure that proposed developments do not adversely affect the\nhighway network and to identify any traffic problems associated with access from the site to the\nexisting transportation network. The purpose of the study is also to identify solutions to\npotential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated into the proposed\ndevelopment.\nB. CONDUCT\nA traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional transportation engineer\nand/or certified transportation planner with previous traffic study experience.\nPrior to the preparation of a traffic impact study, a scoping meeting shall be held, including the\nplanning staff, the applicant, and the preparer of the study. The discussion at this meeting\nshould set the study parameters, including the study area, planned and committed roadway\nimprovements (by NCDOT or others), road links and intersections to be analyzed, preliminary\ntraffic distribution, other planned developments to be considered, traffic growth rate, available\ndata, periods for which analysis is to be performed, and other staff concerns.

This management will take the form of tree preservation\nwhen at all possible, and mitigation through the replanting of trees when others must be\nremoved.\nA healthy and expansive tree canopy provides a wide range of benefits to the citizens of\nSouthport. Aesthetically, the nurturing of trees and tree canopy provides for a pleasant and\nbeautiful community in which both residents and visitors alike benefit from. Economically, a\nrobust tree canopy provides a consistent cooling effect on our community and on individual\nproperties that can significantly reduce cooling costs for homeowners and businesses alike.\nArticle 3: Zoning\nPage 3-80\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 3.8 Bufferyard Width\nCELL (1, 3): \nTable 3.8 Bufferyard Width\nCELL (1, 4): \nTable 3.8 Bufferyard Width\nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nAdjacent Property Zoning and Required Buffer Width (feet)\nCELL (2, 3): \nAdjacent Property Zoning and Required Buffer Width (feet)\nCELL (2, 4): \nAdjacent Property Zoning and Required Buffer Width (feet)\nCELL (2, 5): \nAdjacent Property Zoning and Required Buffer Width (feet)\nCELL (2, 6): \nAdjacent Property Zoning and Required Buffer Width (feet)\nCELL (2, 7): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#2: R-10, R-20\nCELL (3, 2): \n0'\nCELL (3, 3): \n0'\nCELL (3, 4): \n0'\nCELL (3, 5): \n0'\nCELL (3, 6): \n0'\nCELL (3, 7): \n0'\nCELL (4, 1): \n#3: MF, MH, O&I\nCELL (4, 2): \n20'\nCELL (4, 3): \n20'\nCELL (4, 4): \n0'\nCELL (4, 5): \n20'\nCELL (4, 6): \n20'\nCELL (4, 7): \n20'\nCELL (5, 1): \n#4: BD\nCELL (5, 2): \n10'\nCELL (5, 3): \n10'\nCELL (5, 4): \n10'\nCELL (5, 5): \n0'\nCELL (5, 6): \n0'\nCELL (5, 7): \n0'\nCELL (6, 1): \n#5: CBD\nCELL (6, 2): \n0'\nCELL (6, 3): \n0'\nCELL (6, 4): \n0'\nCELL (6, 5): \n0'\nCELL (6, 6): \n0'\nCELL (6, 7): \n0'\nCELL (7, 1): \n#6: HC\nCELL (7, 2): \n40'\nCELL (7, 3): \n40'\nCELL (7, 4): \n20'\nCELL (7, 5): \n0'\nCELL (7, 6): \n0'\nCELL (7, 7): \n20'\nCELL (8, 1): \n#7: HI, LI\nCELL (8, 2): \n40'\nCELL (8, 3): \n40'\nCELL (8, 4): \n40'\nCELL (8, 5): \n20'\nCELL (8, 6): \n20'\nCELL (8, 7): \n0'\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 3.9 Bufferyard Type\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \nBuffer Type\nCELL (2, 2): \nType A\nCELL (2, 3): \nType B\nCELL (3, 1): \nAdjacent Land Uses\nCELL (3, 2): \nOne and Two-family Residential\nCELL (3, 3): \nNon-Residential/Multi-family\nCELL (4, 1): \nMinimum # of Trees\nCELL (4, 2): \n2 canopy, 4 understory per 1,000 square\nfeet\nCELL (4, 3): \n1 canopy, 2 understory per 1,000 square\nfeet\nCELL (5, 1): \nMinimum # of Shrubs\nCELL (5, 2): \n12 per 1,000 square feet\nCELL (5, 3): \n8 per 1,000 square feet\nCELL (6, 1): \nMinimum % of Evergreen\nCELL (6, 2): \n75%\nCELL (6, 3): \n50%\n"}, {"page": "133", "text": "City of Southport\nUnified Development Ordinance (UDO)\nProperty values on both public and private land are increased when trees form part of the\nlandscape. A healthy tree can increase residential property values by as much as 27 percent.\nOne large tree can lift up to 100 gallons of water out of the ground and discharge it into the air\nin a day, helping to filter the air that we breathe and control storm water. In our coastal\nlocation, Southport's tree canopy protects our community and helps mitigate the damage\ncaused by wind during tropical storms and hurricanes.\nThe city finds that the preferred method used by developers of proposed development for\nminor, major, or PUD development in the city is to clearcut the entire area to be developed and\nthen to replant trees in mitigation of the damage done by the clearcutting. The City finds that,\neven when fully mitigated pursuant to this ordinance, both the aesthetic and environmental\ndamage done by the mass and indiscriminate destruction of forest by such clearcutting can\nnever be fully restored until the trees planted in mitigation reach maturity many years in the\nfuture. For this reason, the City seeks to limit the environmental and aesthetic damage done in\nthe process of development to the extent reasonably possible by reducing the number of trees\nremoved in development rather than planting new trees in substitution therefore.\nFor all these reasons, the City of Southport places great value on our Urban Maritime Forest and\nthe tangible and intangible benefits that it provides.

GENERAL\nThere are existing uses of land, structures, lots of record, signs, and site features that were\nlawfully established before the effective date of this ordinance or a subsequent amendment\nthereto, that now do not conform to standards and requirements of this ordinance. Such uses,\nstructures, lots, signs, and site features are collectively referred to as \"nonconformities.\" The\npurpose and intent of this section is to allow nonconformities to continue to exist, but to\nregulate their continued existence and limit their expansion so as to bring them into conformity\nto the extent that is reasonably practicable.\nB. CONTINUATION - REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE\n1.\nContinuation. Nonconformities are allowed to continue in accordance with the\nrequirements of this section.\n2.\nMaintenance Allowed. Nonconformities are allowed and encouraged to receive\nminor repairs and routine maintenance that are necessary to maintain the\nnonconformity and its surroundings in a safe condition and to protect against\nhealth hazards.\n3.\nStrengthening Allowed. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the strengthening\nor restoration to a safe or lawful condition of any part of any building or\nstructure declared unsafe or unlawful by the city's building inspector.\n4.\nChange of ownership/tenancy. No change of title or possession or right to\npossession of property involved with a nonconformity shall be construed to\nprevent the continuance of such nonconformity.\nArticle 3: Zoning\nPage 3-97\n"}, {"page": "150", "text": "City of Southport\nUnified Development Ordinance (UDO)\nC. NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD\n1.\nLegal Nonconforming Lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Any lot of\nrecord existing as of the effective date of this ordinance that has dimensions and\narea requirements which are less than required by the district in which it is\nlocated, may be used as a building site for any permitted use in that district\nsubject to compliance with all required setbacks or applicable dimensional\nstandard exceptions, and all other applicable development standards.\n2.\nContiguous nonconforming lots owned by the same person, which were legally\nsubdivided and recorded in Brunswick County prior to August of 1973, may be\ncombined for the purpose of re-positioning lot lines as long as all of the net\nresulting lots are less non-conforming. No additional lots may be created\nthrough this process, as the number of lots resulting from the reconfiguration\nmust be equal to or less than the number of lots originally in place. The resulting\nlots must be more conforming to all city standards than they were prior to\nundertaking this process. Any structure in existence on any of these contiguous\nlots at the time of reconfiguration cannot create new non-conformities or\nincrease the extent of existing non-conformities with respect to yard size and\nsetback requirements.\nD. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES (DIMENSIONAL NONCONFORMITY)\nWhere a lawfully established principal structure, accessory structure, fence, wall, pier, dock,\ndeck, staircase, driveway or similar structure exists as of the effective date of this ordinance that\ncould not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot\ncoverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such\nstructure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and compliant with all other\nstate or federal regulations, including substantial damage/improvement flood damage\nprevention ordinance regulations, subject to the following provisions:\n1.\nNonconforming structures subject to damage by fire, explosion, tornado,\nearthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause may be reconstructed in\nthe same location and with the same footprint as existed prior to damage. In no\ninstance shall replacement of a nonconforming structure increase the\nnonconformity or result in a larger structure than existed prior to damage.\n2.\nNonconforming structures with maintenance and repair needs may be replaced\nin the same location and with the same footprint in accordance with a previously\napproved site plan or building permit, as applicable; in the same location and up\nto the same dimensions as originally existed; or in compliance with the current\ndimensional requirements.\nE. INONCONFORMING USES\nThe lawfully established use of building or premises existing as of the effective date of this\nordinance may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions of this\nordinance, and nonconforming uses therein changed are subject to the following regulations:\nArticle 3: Zoning\nPage 3-98\n"}, {"page": "151", "text": "City of Southport\nUnified Development Ordinance (UDO)\n1.\nA nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed\nbuilding that, when the use was made nonconforming by this ordinance, was\nmanifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, a\nnonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land\noutside the original building.\n2.\nA nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than\nwas occupied by that use when it became nonconforming.\n3.\nAny structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a\nnonconforming use may be replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so\nlong as the replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the\nextent of existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback\nrequirements. In particular, a manufactured home may be replaced with a larger\nmanufactured home, and a \"single-wide\" manufactured home may be replaced\nwith a \"double-wide.\" This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in\nabandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations.\nF. ABANDONMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF INONCONFORMING SITUATIONS\nA.\nWhen a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days for any\nreason other than destruction/repair the property involved may thereafter only be used\nfor conforming purposes.\nB.\nFor purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is\nlost pursuant to this subsection, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained\non a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one\napartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming\nmanufactured home park for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that\napartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured home\npark as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in\nconjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the\nrequired period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. And so, if\na\nmanufactured home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a\nconforming residential structure also is located, removal of that manufactured home for\n180 days terminates the right to replace it.\nArticle 3: Zoning\nPage 3-99\n"}, {"page": "152", "text": "City of Southport\nUnified Development Ordinance (UDO)\nArticle 4: Subdivision Regulations\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nARTICLE 4: SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS\n4-1\nArticle 4: Subdivision Regulations\nPage 4-1\nCELL (1, 1): \n4.1 GENERAL\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \n4-2\nCELL (2, 1): \n4.2 APPROVAL\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \n4-2\nCELL (3, 1): \n4.3 LOT STANDARDS\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \n4-2\nCELL (4, 1): \n4.4 EASEMENTS\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \n4-2\nCELL (5, 1): \n4.5 HOMEOWNERS/PROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \n4-3\nCELL (6, 1): \n4.6 CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (6, 3): \n4-3\nCELL (7, 1): \n4.7 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (7, 3): \n4-4\nCELL (8, 1): \nA.
