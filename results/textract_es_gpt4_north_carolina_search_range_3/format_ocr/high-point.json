Required Findings\n(a) The alternate design is needed:\n(1) Due to the unique function of the building or portion thereof, or\n(2) Because an unreasonable or impractical situation results from the application of the building design standard, or\n(3) Because it is determined that the building is of a unique or iconic design that warrants special consideration.\n(b) The alternate design granted is the minimum required to meet the determined need; and\n(c) The alternate design is compensated by exterior design features that exceed the minimum standard when the building is\nconsidered in its entirety and the building results in a pedestrian oriented design that enhances street level activity.\nD. Conditions of Approval In granting an alternate design the BOA may prescribe conditions of approval, in accordance with Section\n2.3.10, Conditions of Approval, to ensure compliance with the standards of this section, and to assure that the use of the land to\nwhich the alternate design applies will be compatible with surrounding lands and will not alter the essential character of the area in\nwhich the alternate design is proposed.\n1.\nAn alternate design granted subject to a condition of approval shall be permitted as long as there is compliance with the\ncondition.\n2.

Effect\n1. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed, unless the City official from whom the appeal is taken\ncertifies to the BOA, after notice of appeal has been filed, that because of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the city\nofficial's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously\ninterfere with enforcement of this Ordinance.\n2. If certification by a City official is filed, administrative proceedings shall not be stayed except through issuance of a restraining\norder by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n3. If the appeal is not stayed, the appellant may file for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the BOA shall meet to consider the\nappeal with 15 days of the date the request is filed.\n4. The filing of an appeal prevents the filing of an application for a zoning map amendment or special use for the same land\nsubject to an appeal application, as well as the filing of a text amendment application by the same party filing the appeal until\nthe appeal application is decided or appealed to the courts.\nF.

Beneficial Use Determination Review Standards\n(a) General In determining if a landowner has been deprived of an economically beneficial use of land, the Hearing Officer and\nthe City Council shall take into account the following factors:\n(1) Economically Viable Use In making the determination of whether the land is provided an economically viable use, the\nHearing Officer and the City Council shall first evaluate the uses of the land as provided by this Ordinance, and the uses\nof land in relation to the uses provided similarly situated lands. For the purposes of this section, \"economically viable\nuse\" means the opportunity to make a return equivalent to that which would have been received from a conservative\nfinancial investment. Transitory economic issues shall not be relevant to this determination.\n(2) Diminution in Value The market value of the land, as established by the comparable sales approach, prior to adoption\nof this Ordinance, or a relevant amendment thereto, which caused the landowner to apply for relief shall be compared\nto the market value of the land, as established by the comparable sales approach, with the regulations as applied.\nMarket value of the land prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, or a relevant amendment, shall constitute its highest\nand best use on December 31, 2016 of the relevant amendment thereto or the date of purchase of the land, whichever\nis later, and any other land value/appraisal information that the applicant would like to be considered. All appraisals\nshall be proposed by qualified licensed appraisers, and shall follow the best professional practices as established by the\nprofession. A mere diminution in market value is not sufficient to support a determination of denial of economically\nbeneficial use.\n(b) Subsidy The amount or nature of any subsidy that may be required by the City, neighbors, purchasers, tenants, or the\npublic if the uses allowed under this Ordinance are modified.\n(c) Other Adverse Effects Any other adverse effects on the City and its residents.\n(d) Current State of the Law The state of the law established by the United States Supreme Court, the federal Circuit Courts of\nAppeals, and the North Carolina Supreme Court, relevant to these standards.\n6. Relief If the finding is that a landowner has been deprived economically beneficial use of land, or is otherwise entitled to relief\nin accordance with the standards of this section, relief shall be granted.\n(a) General In granting relief, the Hearing Officer may recommend and the City Council may adopt any legally available\nincentive or measure reasonably necessary to offset any substantial economic hardship, and may condition such incentives\nupon approval of specific development plans. If there is a finding that the denial of the application would create a\nsubstantial economic hardship, the Hearing Officer may recommend and the City Council may consider additional relief to\nprovide an appropriate increase in market value or other benefit or return to the applicant sufficient to offset the\nsubstantial economic hardship. The types of incentives that the Hearing Officer may recommend and the City Council may\nconsider include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(1) A zoning map amendment of the land to a more appropriate classification, issuance of a variance, approval of a site\nplan, or other appropriate land use regulatory action that will enable the applicant to realize a reasonable return on the\n58 of 466\n10/20/2023, PM\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "High Point, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nland;\n(2) An opportunity to transfer density or cluster development on other land;\n(3) A modification of permit fees;\n(4) Development finance assistance;\n(5) Approval of development on some portion of the land; or\n(6) Acquisition of all or a portion of the property at market value.\n(b) Minimum Increase In granting relief, the landowner shall be given the minimum increase in use or density/intensity or\nother possible concessions from this Ordinance and Section 2.4.4 Relief, above, in order to permit an economically\nviable use of the land or a use that is determined to be required by law. The highest use, or even an average or generally\nreasonable expectation, is not required or intended as the appropriate remedy. The following guidelines shall be used for\ndetermining the minimum economically viable use of land and, therefore, the amount of relief to be granted a landowner in\norder to reach that minimum.\n(1) A minimum economically viable use of the land should be one that does not have any governmental subsidy attached to\nthe long-term safe occupation of the land. If such a subsidy is needed, then that should be reflected by lowering the use\nintensity that is considered a minimum economically viable use on a market valuation basis.\n(2) A use common to the city, although it may not involve further development of the land, is considered an economically\nviable use. Attention shall also be given to land uses that are considered to be the lowest intensity in the city but which\nstill provide for occupation and living within the city. These land uses, as well, shall be considered economically viable\nuses.\n(3) The actual condition of the land shall be considered. The reality of limited development potential, given the natural\ncondition of the land, shall not be attributed to the regulations applied to the land. If the land is such that it cannot\nsafely accommodate development with normal grading and clearing practices, this fact shall lower the intensity of use\nthat is considered a minimum economically viable use.\n(4) The potential for damages to either residents or land shall be assessed in determining economically viable use. The\nneed for a governmental subsidy to future landowners shall be considered, and the cost of such subsidies shall be\ndeducted from the otherwise established minimum economically viable use.\n(5) Expectations shall, in general, not be considered. Only reasonable expectations backed by investments as required by\nthe current state of the law shall be considered.\n(6) The current state of law established by the United States Supreme Court, the federal Circuit Court of Appeals, and the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court, relevant to the granting of relief.\n(Ord.

Boundaries shown as approximately following a lot line shall be interpreted as following the lot line as it existed when the\nboundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from settlement of a boundary dispute or overlap)\nresults in the lot line moving 10 feet or less, the zoning boundary shall be interpreted as moving with the lot line.\n4. Boundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall be interpreted as following\nthe centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with that centerline to the extent the watercourse moves\nas a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion, sedimentation, etc.).\n5.

District Purpose The Mixed-Use (MX) district is intended to establish compact, pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use development and\nredevelopment at key locations in the Core City in accordance with the City's adopted policy guidance. It seeks to revitalize existing\nneighborhoods by enabling the development of higher intensity neighborhood centers with new housing, shopping, working, and\nrecreational options in close proximity to one another. The proximity of these uses allows nearby residents to meet some of their\ndaily needs without use of an automobile. The district standards address a variety of design elements including building location,\noff-street parking, access, land use, and visual quality.\nB. Procedure for Establishment of Mixed-Use (MX) Districts\n1. Mixed-Use Area Plan Prior to establishment of a MX district for a specific mixed-use area, a plan for the specific mixed-use area\nshall be adopted by the City Council. The mixed-use area plan should comply with the City's adopted policy guidance generally,\nand the specific recommendations for the mixed-use centers in the Core City Plan. The plan should, at a minimum, describe the\ncharacteristics, conditions, boundaries, and development goals of the area.\n2. Mixed-Use Area Plan Approval After completion, the mixed-use area plan shall be forwarded to the P&Z for its review and\nrecommendations following a public hearing. Upon completion of its review, the plan along with the recommendations of the\nP&Z shall be forwarded to the City Council for review and a public hearing. A mixed-use area plan shall be approved by the City\nCouncil for a specific mixed-use area before establishment of a corresponding MX district for the same area.\n3. District Organization\n(a) The MX district is organized into a series of different districts (e.g., Mixed-Use Washington Street (MX-W) as depicted on the\nOfficial Zoning Map) to better recognize the differing development contexts.\n(b) The City Council may establish an MX district in accordance with this section, Section 2.4.20, Zoning Map Amendment, and\nSection 2.4.15, Text Amendment.\n(c) Based on its associated mixed-use area plan, each MX district should, at a minimum, include boundaries, dimensional\nstandards, and any other standards unique to the district. The general standards in Section 3.5.7 General Standards for\nAll MX Districts shall also apply. If there is a conflict between the general standards for all MX districts and the specific\nstandards for the individual MX districts, the specific standards for the individual MX district shall control.\nC. General Standards for All MX Districts Except where otherwise indicated below, the standards in this section shall apply to all\ndevelopment in all MX districts.\n1.

Reclassification of land to a conditional zoning district allows a landowner to propose, and the City Council to\nconsider, additional conditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses, use standards, development intensities, development\nstandards, and other regulations applicable in the parallel general zoning district. This enables the City and the landowner to tailor a\nzoning classification to accommodate desirable development while avoiding or addressing anticipated problems that may arise from\ndevelopment otherwise allowed by the general zoning district.\n3.6.2.

Where land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay zoning district expressly\nconflict with those governing another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall apply.\n3.8.5. - Airport Overlay (ARO)\nA. Purpose The purpose of the Airport Overlay (ARO) district is to establish noise mitigation measures and prohibit certain uses in the\nvicinity of the Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTIA) and to:\n1. Facilitate orderly development around PTIA.\n2. Ensure land use compatibility by protecting noise sensitive uses from objectionable aircraft noise impacts.\n3. Mitigate noise impacts from aircraft overflights.\n4. Contribute to the safe operation of the airport.\nB. Applicability The ARO district applies to designated land in the vicinity of the PTIA.\n1. The district boundaries are defined on the Official Zoning Map. The boundaries generally follow physical features and property\nlines and are associated with aircraft noise impacts as identified by the 2007 FAR PART 150 Study, 2020 PART 150 Update and\nthe 2040 PTIA Master Plan.\n2. None of the provisions of the ARO district shall be construed to prohibit the continuance, expansion, or re-establishment of an\nexisting use. The noise level reduction design standards apply only to new uses and not to the expansion of existing uses or to\nstructure additions. Only new subdivisions of land developed within the district shall be required to grant a waiver of claim.\n3. Nothing in the ARO district is intended to state that objectionable levels of noise from overhead aircraft will be confined to the limits\nof the district.\nC. ARO District Zone Boundaries The ARO district is divided into four zones in order to manage the development of uses that are\nsensitive to and incompatible with certain levels of daytime and nighttime aircraft noise and to mitigate adverse noise impacts to\nthe public, where possible.\n1. Zone 1 Zone 1 is based on the 2014 65 DNL noise contour developed by the 2007 FAR Part 150 Study and physical boundaries\nsuch as Gallimore Dairy Road. The intent of Zone 1 is to prevent the development of uses sensitive to objectionable noise\nresulting from daytime and nighttime aircraft flights and those uses that could pose safety hazards to aircraft.\n2. Zone 2 Zone 2 is based on the 2014 NA 90(1) contour developed by the 2007 FAR Part 150 Study and 2025 PTIA Part 150\nnighttime departure flight tracks. The intent of Zone 2 is to prevent the development of uses sensitive to objectionable noise\nresulting from nighttime aircraft flights.\n3. Zone 3 Zone 3 is also based on the 2014 NA 90(1) contour developed by the 2007 FAR Part 150 Study, as well as influenced by\ndevelopment patterns that existed prior to the establishment of the Airport Overlay District. The intent of Zone 3 is to protect\nresidential uses and their residents by reducing the interior level of objectionable noise resulting from nighttime aircraft flights.\n4. Zone 4 Zone 4 is based on the NA 85(2) contour developed by the 2007 FAR Part 150 Study and 2025 PTIA Part 150 nighttime\ndeparture flight tracks. The intent of Zone 4, along with the other 3 zones, is to provide public notification of potential night time\n189 of 466\n10/20/2023, 4:50 PM\n"}, {"page": "190", "text": "High Point, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\naircraft noise impacts.\nD.

Purpose\nThis section is intended to provide a systematic framework for identifying, describing, categorizing, consolidating, and distinguishing\nland uses to determine how a specific land use activity, or combination of activities, is to be considered when applying the principal use\ntable and other provisions in this Ordinance.\n4.2.2. - Organization of Uses\nSection 4.2, Use Classifications, Use Categories, and Use Types, organizes principal uses by use classifications, use categories, and use\ntypes to provide a systematic basis for identifying, describing, categorizing, consolidating, and distinguishing land uses to determine\nwhether a specific use is permitted in a particular zoning district.\nA. Use Classifications The use classifications identify broad classifications of land use and include agricultural uses, residential\nuses, institutional uses, commercial uses, and industrial uses. Use classifications are further broken down into a series of\ngeneral \"use categories\" and specific \"use types.\"\nB. Use Categories The use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications and are based on\ncommon functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or\nresidents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. For example, the Residential Use Classification is\ndivided into the Common Elements Recreation, Household Living, Group Living, and Life Care use categories. Use categories are\nfurther broken down into a series of individual \"use types\".\nC. Use Types The specific use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the specific principal uses that are\nconsidered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category. For example, family care homes, live/work dwellings,\nmanufactured dwellings, multi-family dwellings, single-family attached dwellings, single-family detached dwellings, and duplex\ndwellings are use types in the Household Living Use Category.\nD.

Landscape yards are required along the perimeter, extending inward from the lot line, of a zone lot or development site in\naccordance with Table 5.5.11.B, Perimeter Landscape Yard Types, and Table 5.5.11.C1, Land Use Intensity. They are intended to\nmitigate potential adverse impacts that may result when higher intensity land uses are located adjacent to lower intensity land\nuses.\n2. The width of permitted driveways and permitted cross-access easements, measured at the lot line, shall be excluded from the\ncalculation of required plant material.\n3. A perimeter landscape yard may be located along shared access easements between parcels in nonresidential development.\n4. A perimeter landscape yard in a multiple lot development that is configured and developed as a single entity, is only required\naround the outer perimeter of the development.\n5. Stormwater management devices that incorporate vegetation (e.g., bio-retention cell, rain garden, constructed wetlands, etc.)\nmay be placed within a perimeter landscape yard provided the screening function of the landscape yard is maintained. Any\nplant material meeting the minimum requirements for the landscape yard may be counted toward the requirements.\nB.

Landscape Yard Type Application\n1. To determine the type of landscape yard required, first identify the land use intensity of the proposed (new, changed, or\nexpanded) use, then identify the land use intensity of each existing use on adjacent sites (see Table 5.5.11.C1, Land Use\nIntensity). Then, using Table 5.5.11.C2, Type of Landscape Yard Required, the intersection of the row associated with the\nproposed use and the column associated with the adjacent use shows the type of landscape yard required.\n2. The land use intensity is a number that corresponds to the intensity of development.\n3. A land use is considered to \"exist\" on an adjacent property when a building permit is issued.\n4. If a zone lot contains uses with different land use intensities, the higher numbered land use intensity applies unless an alternate\nlandscape plan is approved in accordance with Section 5.5.13 Alternate Landscape Plan.\n5. No landscape yard shall be required where a proposed use is adjacent to an existing agricultural use.\n6.

Purpose and Intent\nThe purpose of this section is to promote sustainable development practices as a means of protecting and conserving natural\nresources and ensuring a high quality of life for residents. More specifically, they are intended to provide incentives for new\ndevelopment to incorporate measures that conserve energy, conserves water, and promotes a healthy landscape.\n5.15.2. Applicability\nThe incentives included in this section are available to all new development in the City.\n5.15.3. Procedure\nA.\nWritten Request Development seeking to use incentives shall include a written request with the development application that\ndemonstrates how compliance with these standards will be achieved.\nB. Incentive Amount Development may include a sufficient number of sustainable development practices to take advantage of more\nthan one type of incentive, but in no instance shall the amount of an incentive be increased or decreased (as appropriate) beyond\nthe maximum listed in this section.\nC. Time of Review Review for compliance with this section, and granting of requests in accordance with this section shall occur during\nreview of a site plan, group development plan, preliminary plan, PD master plan, use permit, or building permit, as appropriate. The\ndecision-making body responsible for review of the development application shall also be responsible for the review of sustainable\ndevelopment incentive request.\nD. Earning Incentives The incentive shall be based on the number of sustainable development practices provided, in accordance with\nTable 5.15.3.E, Sustainable Development Incentives, and Section 5.15.4, Sustainable Development Features. To earn a particular\nincentive, development must provide the minimum number of associated sustainable development features from Schedule A and\nSchedule B in Table 5.15.3.E. An applicant may select the kinds of sustainable development features provided to comply with Table\n5.15.3.E.\nE. Provide Features from Both Schedules The ability to take advantage of a sustainable development incentive requires new\ndevelopment to include sustainability features from both Schedule A and Schedule B in Table 5.15.4, Sustainable Development\nFeatures. The applicant may choose which features to include as long as the minimum number of features from each of the\nschedules is provided. Generally, items in Schedule A are typically more expensive than items in Schedule B, though this will depend\nupon the proposed development, site conditions, type of uses proposed, and many other features.\nTABLE 5.15.3.E: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES\n329 of 466\n10/20/2023, 4:50 PM\n"}, {"page": "330", "text": "High Point, NC Development Ordinance\n(Ord.

Slope and Buffer Protection\n1. Purpose The purpose of this provision is to limit the loss of soil, reduce soil erosion, minimize excess stormwater runoff, lessen\nthe degradation of surface waters, and protect the buffers so established to protect surface waters. To this end, an addition to\nthe surface water buffer requirements of Section 6.2.9 ( Surface Water Buffers, shall be required when intermittent and\nperennial surface waters abut moderate to steep slopes.\n2. Application\n(a) Such addition to the surface water buffer requirements shall only apply where that portion of the surface water is adjacent\nto moderate to steep slope areas.\n(b) For slopes with a value of 15 percent or less, no additional buffering is required.\n(c) For slopes of greater than 15 percent up to 25 percent, an additional 15-foot wide undisturbed buffer shall be required.\n(d) For slopes greater than 25 percent, an additional 30 feet of undisturbed buffer shall be required.\n(e) These calculations shall be made from each side of the surface water bank.\n(f) Such additional buffer required by this section shall extend Zone 2 of the surface water buffer.\n(g) In the case where Zone 3 is required, the extension of the Zone 2 surface water buffer may be offset by an identical\ndecrease in width in Zone 3.\n3. Determination\n(a) The determination of whether such moderate to steep slope areas exist adjacent to a surface water shall be made by\nmaking 100 foot long perpendicular measurements at intervals, not greater than 50 feet in length, or at intervals as\notherwise determined by the TRC, along the entire length of the surface water as measured from the top of bank.\n(b) These measurements shall be based on the most recent topographic survey of land that utilizes the smallest contour\ninterval.\n343 of 466\n10/20/2023, 4:50 PM\n"}, {"page": "344", "text": "High Point, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n(c) Applicants should consult the Development Guide for specific calculations, instructions, and illustrations.\nE.

Goals The primary goals of low impact design are to lower the impact of development on receiving waters, to encourage\nenvironmentally sensitive development, to help build communities based on environmental stewardship, and to reduce\nconstruction and maintenance costs of the stormwater infrastructure. The use of low impact design shall address these goals\nthrough the objectives found in subsection (B) below.\nB. Objectives\n1. Preserve Fragile Areas and Open Space Preserve fragile areas through the following:\n(a) Avoiding riparian areas, wetlands, steep slopes, high infiltration and hydric soils;\n(b) Maximizing open space and common area through cluster development where appropriate; and\n(c) Maintaining open space in a natural condition by reforestation where clearing has occurred.\n2. Minimize Land Disturbance and Built-Upon Area Design development to provide the following:\n(a) Efficient layout to reduce overall length of streets;\n(b) Shared parking and drives where possible to further reduce built-upon area;\n(c) Use of multiple stormwater control measures such as bio-retention cells and infiltration areas to minimize impact; and\n(d) Step floor elevations to fit terrain and avoid slab-on-grade construction to minimize land disturbance.\n3. Protect Water Resources Use site design techniques to replicate pre-existing hydrologic site conditions by placing water quality\ncontrol devices close to the source. Techniques may include the following:\n(a) Designing driveways and parking areas with vegetated swales and/or sheet flow into infiltration areas; and\n(b) Using grass swales instead of curb and gutter to increase water filtration.\nC. Process The low impact design process is established in the City of High Point Stormwater Best Management Practices Design\nManual.\n(Ord. No. 7266/17-08 \u00a7 27, 1-17-2017; Ord.

Low Density Development Calculation\n(a) For low density development, density is measured in dwelling units per acre for single-family detached and duplex\nresidential developments.\n(b) For recreational facilities, such as golf courses and tennis and swim clubs lying within a residential development, impacts\nshall be determined by measuring the built-upon area on the lot or common area and dividing by 3,000 square feet to\nobtain a dwelling unit equivalency number.\n(c) Upon approval of a modification by the TRC, low density developments may utilize either the density standard, built-upon\narea standard, or combination thereof pursuant to Table 6.2.11.A1, Minimum Stormwater Controls Required in the General\nWatershed Area and in Non-water Supply Watersheds.\n(d) For all other residential and nonresidential development, the built-upon area measure shall apply.\n2. High Density Development Calculation For all high density development the built-upon area measure shall apply.\n3. Density and Built-Upon Area Calculations\n(a) For the purpose of calculating density, acres shall be gross acres.\n(b) As an alternative, single-family detached or duplex residential developments dividing 4 or fewer lots and not constructing\nstreets may use 20,000 square-foot lots where the maximum density is 2 dwelling units per acre and 40,000 square-foot lots\n344 of 466\n10/20/2023, 4:50 PM\n"}, {"page": "345", "text": "High Point, NC Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nwhere the maximum density is 1 dwelling unit per acre.\n(c) If single-family detached or duplex dwellings are intermingled within a development with other uses, then the built-upon\narea measurement shall apply.\n(d) When sections of the same development are devoted to single-family detached or duplex residential development and\nother sections are devoted to other uses, then the developer may apply the appropriate measurement to the different\nsections or may use the built-upon area measurement for the entire development.\n(e) Single-family detached or duplex residential development using the built-upon area measurement shall assume 3,000\nsquare feet of built-upon area per lot.\n(f) The built-upon area maximum shall apply to the entire development, including streets, buildings, drives, and other\nimpervious surfaces.\n(g) The maximum built-upon area allowed shall be allocated throughout the development.\n(h) In single-family detached and duplex residential developments, the allocation to each lot shall be uniform.\n(i) In all other developments, the allocation may vary among lots.\n(j) In all cases, the recorded plat shall clearly state each lot's allocation and restrictive covenants shall record these allocations.\nNOTES:\n[1] Single-family detached and duplex development utilizing the low density option shall use the density standards except as\napproved by modification pursuant to Section 6.2.11 Low Density Development Calculation.

Lands\nlocated within any private easements shall be included within the lot area. The following features shall not be included in\ncalculating minimum lot area:\n(1) Public street rights-of-way;\n(2) Private street common area; and\n(3) The \"pole\" or \"pan handle\" portion of a flag lot.\n(b) In the case of single-family attached and multi-family development, the district tables in Chapter 3: Zoning Districts set out a\nminimum development size for minimum lot area. The minimum development size is the land area necessary for at least 3\ndwelling units. Beyond the first 3 units, the maximum density for the zoning district controls the maximum number of\ndwelling units per acre.\n2. Lot Area Averaging Lot area averaging may be applied to new single-family detached development located outside the Core City\narea in certain zoning districts as noted in the individual zoning district dimensional standards in Chapter 3 Zoning Districts. The\nareas of residential lots in the same development may be averaged in order to meet the required minimum lot area for the\napplicable zoning district in accordance with the following:\n(a) Lot area averaging must be proposed and approved at the time of preliminary plan approval.\n(b) All lots to be averaged must be for residential use and be within 75% to 125% of the minimum lot area required by the\nzoning district.\n(c) The areas of all such lots in the development are added together and divided by the total number of lots.

Maximum Density The maximum number of residential dwelling units permitted per acre of land area. Density is determined by\ndividing the number of dwelling units by the total amount of land area within a particular lot or tract.\nB. Maximum Density Calculation\n1. Land area that is dedicated to the City for drainageway and open space on the final plat may be included in the lot area for the\npurpose of determining the maximum number of dwelling units permitted.\n2. When the developer dedicates and builds a new public street in or abutting a multi-family development, the street right-of-way\nmay be included in the lot area for the purpose of determining the maximum number of dwelling units permitted.\n3. When a single-family attached or multi-family development occupies both sides of a street for a minimum centerline distance of\n400 feet, the entire development may be treated as a single zone lot for purposes of calculation of the maximum number of\ndwelling units permitted, provided that a final plat is recorded with a prominent note specifying that the property must remain\nin 1 ownership (except for individual units in townhome or condominium developments). This plat note is not required if the\nportion of the development on each side of the street independently meets all requirements of this Ordinance.\n4. Within a mixed-use development the density is determined by dividing the total number of dwelling units by the total acreage of\nthe mixed-use development.\nC. Density Equivalence\n1. When calculating the density for a life care use or private dormitory, 2 bedrooms in a life care or private dormitory shall be\nequivalent to 1 regular dwelling unit.\n2. When calculating the density for single-room occupancy (SRO) residence, a rooming unit of less than 150 square feet shall be\nequivalent to 1/2 a dwelling unit and a rooming unit of 150 square feet or more shall be equivalent to 1 dwelling unit.\n3. Maximum density amounts do not apply to student housing or lodging on college or university campuses when the housing is\nowned or operated by the college or university. In these instances, residential land uses are considered as an accessory to the\ncollege or university principal use.\nD. Rounding When computation of density results in a fraction, the fraction shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number.\nE. Built-Upon Area\n1. The portion of a development that is covered by impervious or partially impervious cover including buildings, pavement, gravel,\nrecreation facilities like courts, but not wooden slat structures such as decks or boardwalks.\n2. The water area of a swimming pool is not considered built-upon area.\nF.
