The regulations of this district are intended to discourage any use which, because of its\ncharacter, would substantially interfere with the development of single family residences in the district and\nwhich would be detrimental to the quiet residential nature of the areas included within this district.\nRA-20 Residential Medium Density District\nThis district is composed of medium density residential development and of open areas which are used for\nfarmland and woodland. The RA-20 district shall consist of single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings,\nmanufacture and modular homes on individual lots and related uses necessary for a sound neighborhood.\nThe regulations for this district are designed to stabilize and encourage a healthful environment for family\nlife in areas where either or both public water or sewer facilities are available.\nR-15 Residential High Density District\nThe R-15 Residential High Density District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is\nfor single-family, two-family, modular homes and manufactured homes on individual lots, and\nmanufactured home parks.

It is expected that municipal water and sewage\nfacilities will be available to each lot in such districts.\nO-I Office and Institutional District\nThe Office and Institutional District is designed to provide a wide range of professional and economic office\nspace, as well as space for public and quasi-public uses.\nN-B Neighborhood Business District\nThe Neighborhood Business District is intended for the use of those businesses and other uses which are\nproperly located near residential areas and which cater to the everyday needs of a limited residential area.\nH-B Highway Business District\nThe Highway Business Districts are located on major thoroughfares and collector streets in the Town\nPlanning Area. They are intended to provide for offices, personal services, and the retailing of durable and\nconvenience goods for the community. Because these commercial uses are subject to public view and are\nimportant to the economy of the community, they should have ample parking, controlled traffic movement\nand suitable landscaping.\nG-M General Manufacturing District\nThe General Manufacturing District provides a place for the location of industrial and other uses which\nwould be incompatible with highway business, office and institutional, or residential districts.
