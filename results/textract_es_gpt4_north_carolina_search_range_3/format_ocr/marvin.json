The provisions for internal sidewalks shall apply to both public and private streets and are in addition to the\nrequirements for sidewalks along adjacent public streets.\nF. Sidewalks and/or pedestrian crosswalks shall be required when the Village Council deems that a street is a strategic\npedestrian route to an existing or planned pedestrian destination, such as a school, park, recreational or cultural facility,\ngreenway trail (or similar amenity), retail commercial/mixed use site, business or office development, or when other\npedestrian safety, access or circulation needs are identified.\nG. Greenstrips of not less than four feet in width shall be required to be placed inward between the edge of the curb and the\nsidewalk. Greenstrips adjacent to the sidewalk shall be graded to one-fourth inch per foot (minimum) up to one and one-\nfourth inch per foot (maximum) towards the curb and gutter or drainage swale. The Village Council shall have the\nauthority to waive or modify the greenstrip requirements on a case by case basis where it is determined that excessive\nnatural grades make this requirement impractical, the placement of a greenstrip would serve no public purpose and/or\nthe greenstrip would not be in keeping with adjacent developed areas along the same street. Examples where these\nrequirements may be waived or modified include:\n1. The site is on a street where other adjacent or nearby developed lots do not contain greenstrips;\n2. There are unique topographic and physical characteristics associated with the site that would severely restrict\nplacement of the greenstrips; and\n3. The presence of public utilities (either above or below ground) would affect the long-term maintenance and upkeep of\nthe greenstrip.\nH. The Zoning Administrator may require a pedestrian crosswalk at least ten feet in width to provide convenient public\naccess to a public area such as a park, greenway or school. The placement of the crosswalk may require the construction\nof additional sidewalk spurs to connect with existing sidewalks located across the street. Crosswalks and sidewalks must\ncomply with applicable standards of NCDOT.\nI. The developer shall be responsible for construction of trails within a trail easement or land dedicated to the Village of\nMarvin.

The purposes of a stream buffer are to ensure that streams and the adjacent lands fulfill their natural functions\nto protect the physical integrity of the stream ecosystem, to prevent encroachment upon the stream ecosystems, and to\nfilter runoff before detrimental material reaches the streams. The provisions contained in this section shall only be\napplicable to lots created after the effective date of the chapter amendment creating this section (October 22, 2004), as\nwell as to the combination or recombination of lots that existed at the date of adoption.\nB. Stream buffer and stream buffer management zones.\n1. Stream buffers are required for all stream segments where the upstream drainage basin is greater than or equal to 50\nacres. On each side of the stream, a stream buffer will begin at the edge of the stream channel and extend\nperpendicular to the stream a distance equal to the lesser of 100 feet or to a ridgeline that changes the runoff flow to\nbe away from the stream.\n2. A stream buffer shall be divided into three stream buffer management zones, each of which has different permitted\nland uses. Each zone shall be identified on any final subdivision plat.\na. Streamside zone. The streamside zone is the 30 feet of stream buffer nearest the stream channel, measured from the\nbank. If the stream buffer is at most 30 feet wide, then the entire stream buffer falls within the streamside zone.\nWith the exceptions noted below, land uses within the streamside zone are limited to flood control and stream bank\nstabilization; otherwise, land disturbances and vegetation clearing are prohibited. No buildings are permitted within\nthe streamside zone.\nb. Managed use zone. The managed use zone immediately follows the streamside zone to a maximum width of 45\nfeet. If the stream buffer is greater than 30 feet but is at most 75 feet wide, then the stream buffer consists of the 30\nfeet of streamside zone followed by the residual as the managed use zone. With the exceptions noted in division (B)\n(2)(d) below, land uses within the managed use zone are limited to stormwater best management practices (BMPs)\npassive recreation uses such as greenway trails and bicycle paths and other land uses consistent with maintaining\nthe natural topography and vegetation.

R Marvin Residential.\n1. This district allows for agricultural uses and single-family residential development. The purpose of this zoning district\nis to conserve open space while simultaneously maintaining a density of one residence, or fewer, per acre. In order to\nachieve these goals, the average lot size may vary, with an absolute minimum of 25,000 square feet. Additionally,\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n138/392\n"}, {"page": "139", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\ndeep building setbacks on street frontages and tree preservation efforts will retain the rural vistas that typify the\nvillage.\n2. Other desired end-results of the R zoning district include:\na. To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features, by setting them aside\nfrom development;\nb. To conserve scenic views and the village's rural character, and to minimize visual density, by minimizing views of\nnew development from existing roads;\nC. To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land, with amenities in the form of neighborhood\nconservation land, and with a strong community identity;\nd. To protect areas with productive agricultural soils for continued or future agricultural use, by conserving blocks of\nland large enough to allow for efficient farm operations;\ne. To provide design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of road and utility services and infrastructure;\nf. To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation and the minimization of development\non steep slopes;\ng. To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open land within the village to achieve the aforementioned\npurposes and for active or passive recreational use by residents; and\nh.

The\ndevelopment of these uses or developments cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district standards. In\norder to accommodate these unique uses or projects, this section establishes specific development standards for each\nconditional district that allows for flexibility in development while protecting existing developed areas. The process\nfor approval of a conditional district is explained in \u00a7 151.251. The rezoning of any parcel of land to a conditional\ndistrict should be a voluntary process initiated by the property owner. Any area rezoned to a conditional district or\noverlay district shall be consistent with the intent of the goals and objectives of the Land Use Plan, the Tree\nOrdinance and all other plans adopted by the Village Council, unless otherwise stated in the ordinance codified\nherein. Further, such uses may be subject to specific conditions which ensure compatibility of the use with the use\nand enjoyment of neighboring properties.\nb. Each site proposed for a conditional district must be evaluated by the Village Council as to its appropriateness for\nsuch designation. Factors to be taken into consideration shall include, but are not limited to, accessibility,\nsurrounding uses, need for proposed uses, site design including building arrangement, aesthetics, signage, height,\nsize and elevation design, traffic impact within the proposed development and the surrounding service area\nincluding vehicular and pedestrian circulation and parking area design and location, setbacks, lot dimensions,\nopen space conservation, landscape and buffer effectiveness, tree preservation and storm water management.\nC.\nIt\nis the intent of these districts to encourage high quality design and innovative arrangement of lots, buildings,\nparking and open space. Because of the nature of all the factors listed, the approval of a location for a conditional\ndistrict is at the sole discretion of the Village Council after a recommendation by the planning board has been\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n139/392\n"}, {"page": "140", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\nprovided, in accordance with \u00a7 151.251, and in no way implies that any other site will be found acceptable for\nsimilar designation.\n2.

If a recommendation is not made during the time\nperiod, the application shall be forwarded to the Village Council without a recommendation from the planning board.\nE. Village Council action.\n1. The Village Council shall conduct a public hearing on the site-specific vesting plan. The Village Council may only\nrender a decision after having conducted this public hearing and after having received a recommendation from the\nplanning board or the 60-day planning board comment period has expired.\n2. The public hearing shall be held in a legislative manner pursuant to G.S. 160D-1001. The Village of Marvin must be a\nparty to development agreements, while a water and/or sewer authority may enter an agreement as a party, but not\nindependently pursuant to G.S. 160E-1001(b). In approving an application for vested rights of a site-specific vesting\nplan, the Village Council may attach fair and reasonable conditions. The conditions shall not be less restrictive than\nany requirements that would pertain to that particular development found in that zoning district in which the property\nis located. The conditions may exceed any performance criteria or minimum requirements listed elsewhere in this\nchapter that pertain to that development. The applicant shall have reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to\nany of these conditions prior to a final decision being rendered by the Village Council. The Village Council may not\nrequire the landowner to waive the vested right applied for as a condition of developmental approval.\n3. The Village Council may only approve a site-specific vesting plan (with or without conditions attached), after having\nmade each of the following findings in the affirmative:\na. The use meets all required specifications of the zoning regulations;\nb. The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety and will not substantially injure the value of\nadjoining property if located where proposed. Conditions, if any, placed on the site-specific vesting plan by the\nVillage Council shall be adequate to meet this requirement; and\nc. If the site-specific vesting plan is vested for a period of greater than two years, this shall be based on one or more\nfactors SO described in division (F) below.\n4. The burden of proof of producing evidence to support these findings (and to overcome any challenges that approval of\nthe site plan would be contrary to one or more of these findings) shall rest entirely with the applicant.\n5. If the use or development for which the site-specific vesting plan is submitted is a special use, the Village Council\nmay approve the site-specific vesting plan concurrently with the approval of the special use permit. In no case,\nhowever, may a site-specific vesting plan be approved for a use or development which requires the issuance of a\nspecial use permit without the special use permit having first been issued.\nF. Effect of approval.\n1. The effect of the Village Council approving a site-specific vesting plan shall be to vest the site plan for a period of two\nyears from the date of approval. If the applicant requests, however, the Village Council may approve a vesting period\nnot to exceed five years from the date of approval. The vesting of any site plan beyond a two-year period may only be\nauthorized by the Village Council where it is found that due to:\na. The sizing and phasing of the development;\nb. The level of investment;\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n187/392\n"}, {"page": "188", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\nC. The need for the development;\nd. Economic cycles; and\ne.\nMarket conditions, building permits for all phases of the development cannot reasonably be expected to be secured\nwithin two years.\n2. A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use the\nproperty under the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan as provided for in this section. Failure to\nabide by the terms and conditions placed upon the approval will result in the forfeiture of the vested right previously\naccorded.\n3. A vested right, once established as herein provided, shall preclude any zoning action by the village which would\nchange, alter, impair, prevent, diminish or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in the\napproved site specific development except under the following conditions:\na. The affected landowner provides written consent to the village of his or her desire to terminate the vested right;\nb. The village determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that natural or human-made hazards exist\non or in the immediate vicinity of the property which pose a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare if\nthe project were to proceed as indicated in the approved site-specific vesting plan;\nC.\nCompensation is made by the village to the landowner for all costs, expenses and other losses incurred including,\nbut not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal and\nany other consultant's fees incurred after approval together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid;\nd. The village determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that the applicant or his or her\nrepresentative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a\ndifference in the approval by the Village Council of the site-specific vesting plan; or\ne. Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulations that precludes development as\ncontemplated in the site-specific vesting plan. In that case the village may (after having advertised and conducted a\npublic hearing) modify the affected provisions upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a\nfundamental effect on the plan.\n4. Once a vested right is granted to a particular site-specific vesting plan, nothing in this section shall preclude the\nvillage from conducting subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the\noriginal approval, provided the reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval.\nG. Revocation or expiration of a vested right.\n1. The vested right resulting from the approval of a site-specific vesting plan may be revoked by the Village Council as\nprovided for in division (F) above. In addition, a revocation may occur if the Village Council determines that the\nlandowner has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the approval or with any other applicable portion of\nthe zoning regulations.\n2. A vested right shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which\nno valid building permit applications have been filed.\nH. Revocation of building permit. A building permit issued by the county may not be revoked because of the running of\ntime on a piece of property for which a site-specific vesting plan has been approved and the vested right period has not\notherwise expired.\nI. Amendments to the zoning chapter. The establishment of a vested right on a piece of property for a site-specific vesting\nplan shall not preclude the village from establishing and putting into place one or more overlay districts which may\nimpose additional restrictions on the property, provided the restrictions do not affect the allowable type or intensity or\nuse. Otherwise the regulations shall become effective with respect to the subject property upon the expiration or\ntermination of the vested right. The village may also enforce on the property any additional regulations (adopted during\nthe time the vested right was in effect) that are general in nature and applicable to all property subject to the regulations\nof this chapter.\n(Ord.

Permit Choice. If a land development regulation is amended between the time a development permit application was\nsubmitted and a development permit decision is made or if a land development regulation is amended after a\ndevelopment permit decision has been challenged and found to be wrongfully denied or illegal, G.S. 143-755 applies.\nB.\nVested Rights. Amendments in land development regulations are not applicable or enforceable without the written\nconsent of the owner with regard to any of the following:\n1. Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application has been submitted and\nsubsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755.\n2. Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application authorizing the subdivision has been submitted and\nsubsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755.\n3. A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1.\n4. A multi-phased development pursuant to subsection (E) of this section.\n5. A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement.\nThe establishment of a vested right under any subdivision of this subsection does not preclude vesting under one\nor\nmore other subdivisions of this subsection or vesting by application of common law principles. A vested right, once\nestablished as provided for in this section or by common law, precludes any action by the Village of Marvin that would\nchange, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the\napplicable land development regulation or regulations, except where a change in State or federal law mandating the\nVillage of Marvin enforcement occurs after the development application is submitted that has a fundamental and\nretroactive effect on the development or use.\nC. Duration of Vesting. Upon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting granted by subsection (B) of this\nsection for a development project is effective upon filing of the application in accordance with G.S. 143-755, for SO long\nas the permit remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified by this section or other statute, Village of Marvin\npermits expire one year after issuance unless work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced. For the\npurposes of this section, a permit is issued either in the ordinary course of business of the Village of Marvin or by the\nVillage of Marvin as a court directive.\nExcept where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or land development regulation, the statutory vesting granted\nby this section, once established, expires for an uncompleted development project if development work is intentionally\nand voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months, and the statutory vesting period\ngranted by this section for a nonconforming use of property expires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily\ndiscontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months. The 24-month discontinuance period is automatically\ntolled during the pendency of any Board of Adjustment proceeding or civil action in a State or federal trial or appellate\ncourt regarding the validity of a development permit, the use of the property, or the existence of the statutory vesting\nperiod granted by this section. The 24-month discontinuance period is also tolled during the pendency of any litigation\ninvolving the development project or property that is the subject of the vesting.\nD. Multiple Permits for Development Project. Subject to subsection (C) of this section, where multiple Village of Marvin\ndevelopment permits are required to complete a development project, the development permit applicant may choose the\nversion of each of the Village of Marvin land development regulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the\napplication for the initial development permit. This provision is applicable only for those subsequent development\npermit applications filed within 18 months of the date following the approval of an initial permit. For purposes of the\nvesting protections of this subsection, an erosion and sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial\ndevelopment permit.\nE. Multi-Phased Development. A multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with the land\ndevelopment regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased\ndevelopment. A right which has been vested as provided for in this subsection remains vested for a period of seven years\nfrom the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.\nF. Continuing Review. Following issuance of a development permit, the Village of Marvin may make subsequent\ninspections and reviews to ensure compliance with the applicable land development regulations in effect at the time of\nthe original application.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n189/392\n"}, {"page": "190", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\nG.

Necessary deviations from the Stormwater Manual as may be necessary to accommodate soil types found in the county,\nand village's subdivision and zoning regulations. When discrepancies are found between the Stormwater Manual and the\nvillage zoning regulations or subdivision regulations, the stricter regulation shall apply.\nB. In order to prevent flooding and damage to properties, all developments disturbing an acre or more of land and having\nnet increased impervious built-upon area exceeding 24% of the total area of the development site minus all built-upon\narea that was developed before the adoption of this ordinance, shall provide stormwater detention to control the peak\nrunoff from the two-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year, 24-hour storm events to pre-development levels. Developments\ndisturbing less than one acre and are not part of a common plan of development are exempted from this stormwater\ndetention regulation.\nC.

Where ponds are proposed to be constructed, the owners, heirs, assigns or successors of the land shall agree to perpetual\nmaintenance of the pond and shall release and hold harmless the village from any liability, claims, demands, attorney's\nfees and costs or judgments arising from the pond. At a minimum, ponds shall be inspected on a yearly basis.\nE. No certificate of occupancy or release of performance bond funds (as addressed in \u00a7 150.081) shall be issued for any\ndevelopment until a registered land surveyor has surveyed the as-built detention facilities and the revised calculations\nhave been submitted and approved by the village. The revised calculations must be sealed by a design professional. In\naddition, the village shall not grant final plat approval unless the village has approved the as-built detention plans and/or\na performance bond has been secured.\nF. When a detention facility serves more than one property, a permanent detention easement which encompasses the\ndetention facility shall be shown on a recorded plat. This easement shall be described by metes and bounds description.\nG.

OR-2020-03-01, passed 03/10/2020)\nEffective on: 3/10/2020\n\u00a7 151.063 STREAM BUFFERS.\nA. Purpose. The purposes of a stream buffer are to ensure that streams and the adjacent lands fulfill their natural functions\nto protect the physical integrity of the stream ecosystem, to prevent encroachment upon the stream ecosystems and to\nfilter runoff before detrimental material reaches the streams. The provisions contained in this section shall only be\napplicable to lots created after the effective date of the ordinance amendment creating this section (October 22, 2004), as\nwell as to the combination or recombination of lots that existed at the date of adoption.\nB. Stream buffer and stream buffer management zones.\n1. Stream buffers are required for all stream segments where the upstream drainage basin is greater than or equal to 50\nacres. On each side of the stream, a stream buffer will begin at the edge of the stream channel and extend\nperpendicular to the stream a distance equal to the lesser of 100 feet or to a ridge line that changes the runoff flow to\nbe away from the stream.\n2. A stream buffer shall be divided into three stream buffer management zones, each of which has different permitted\nland uses. Each zone shall be identified on any final subdivision plat.\na. Streamside zone. The streamside zone is the 30 feet of stream buffer nearest the stream channel, measured from\nthe bank. If the stream buffer is at most 30 feet wide, then the entire stream buffer falls within the streamside zone.\nWith the exceptions noted below, land uses within the streamside zone are limited to flood control and stream bank\nstabilization; otherwise, land disturbances and vegetation clearing are prohibited. No buildings are permitted within\nthe streamside zone.\nb. Managed use zone. The managed use zone immediately follows the streamside zone to a maximum width of 45\nfeet. If the stream buffer is greater than 30 feet but is at most 75 feet wide, then the stream buffer consists of the 30\nfeet of streamside zone followed by the residual as the managed use zone. With the exceptions noted in division (B)\n(2)(d) below, land uses within the managed use zone are limited to stormwater best management practices (BMPs)\npassive recreation uses such as greenway trails and bicycle paths and other land uses consistent with maintaining\nthe natural topography and vegetation. No buildings are permitted within the managed use zone.\nC. Upland zone. The upland zone immediately follows the managed use zone to a maximum width of 25 feet. If the\nstream buffer is greater than 75 feet but is at most 100 feet wide, then the stream buffer shall consist of 30 feet of\nstreamside zone, followed by 45 feet of managed use zone, followed by the residual as upland zone. With the\nexceptions noted in division (B)(2)(d) below, land uses within the upland zone are limited to stormwater best\nmanagement practices (BMPs) passive recreation uses such as greenway trails and bicycle paths, which may be\nbuilt with impervious materials, and other land uses consistent with maintaining the natural topography and\nmanaging the natural vegetation, residential grass cover or agricultural grasses. Only small storage buildings (under\n12 feet in every direction) are permitted within the upland zone.\nd. Exceptions to regulations. The following land uses are permitted within the stream buffers subject to the\nrequirement that the lands adjacent to these uses that are disturbed as a result of these uses are stabilized and\nreplanted with native vegetation:\n1. Near perpendicular (75 degrees or greater) utility stream crossings approved otherwise allowed by this chapter;\n2. Parallel utility installation otherwise allowed by this chapter;\n3. Near perpendicular (75 degrees or greater) stream crossings by streets or by greenway trails, bicycle paths,\nsidewalks and other pedestrian path allowed by this chapter;\n4. Near perpendicular (75 degrees or greater) crossings for farm animals with fencing to minimize the animals'\nimpacts upon the stream buffers. Note: this does not require specific plat or site plan approval;\n5. Narrow footpaths constructed with minimal vegetation disturbance that permit the landowner to walk to the\nstream. Note: this does not require specific plat or site plan approval;\n6. Incidental drainage improvements or repairs for maintenance.

Newly created ponds or lakes. New ponds shall have the same buffers as the original creek, except that tree\nplanting will not be required. Buffer requirements will not apply to dams;\n8. Mitigation approved by a state or federal agency acting under \u00a7 401 or \u00a7 404 of the Clean Water Act, being 42\nUSC 7401 et seq.;\n9. Other land uses within the stream buffers may be approved as part of a development plan that is subject to the\nrequirement that the landowner demonstrate that the net result of the land use and strategy to mitigate the impact\nof the land use provide at least the same protection to the stream's water quality and ecological integrity; and\n10.

A natural materials stockpile is viewed as a temporary use and regulations contained herein are designed to ensure that\nthe stockpile remains on the piece of property for the shortest period of time necessary to serve its particular purpose.\nThe owner of the property upon which the stockpile is located shall be responsible for ensuring that the stockpile is\nsituated on the property SO as not to materially impact or impair any adjacent properties and/or nearby streams, creeks or\nbodies of water.\nB. The materials shall be held for future use on the lot or development in question. Stockpiling that results from the\nexcavation of dirt from one lot or development and placing it on another lot or development shall not be allowed unless\nthe stockpile is necessary to meet the requirements of a site plan approved by the village.\nC. In addition to the findings contained in \u00a7 151.103, the additional findings indicated below must be approved before a\nspecial use permit for a material stockpile may be granted:\n1. The length of time which the material stockpile is allowed to remain on the property is the shortest time necessary to\nreasonably serve its intended need; and\n2.

Materials are often stockpiled in association with new developments. Accordingly, a special use permit (or the creation\nof a new conditional district) for a development may contain fair and reasonable conditions related to stockpiling that\nequal or exceed the standards set forth herein.\n(Ord. OR-1996-02-01, passed 2-13-1996; Ord. passed 7-8-2008; Ord. OR-2021-06-03, passed 06/24/2021)\nEffective on: 6/24/2021\n\u00a7 151.065 TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND FACILITIES.\nIn recognition of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the intent of the village to allow communication\nproviders the opportunity to locate telecommunication towers and related facilities within its jurisdiction while protecting\nthe health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the village and of those in its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Wireless towers\nmay be considered incompatible with other types of uses, most notably residential uses; therefore special regulations are\nnecessary to ensure that any adverse affects created by telecommunication towers to existing and future development are\nmitigated.\nA. Aesthetics. To the extent reasonably feasible, telecommunication towers shall be designed with stealth technology\nto\nblend with the adjacent properties and their uses or with the principal use on the property (if the tower is not the\nprincipal use).\nB. Maximum height. Except as provided in this division, the maximum allowable height of a telecommunications tower is\n90 feet. No tower shall have a height greater than 90 feet unless a variance is granted by the board of adjustment. The\nboard of adjustment, to grant a variance for a telecommunications tower, must explicitly find that the 90-foot maximum\nheight will not allow the tower at issue to provide adequate service, in which case the board of adjustment shall specify\na\ndifferent height for that tower in the variance.\nC. Co-location.\n1. It is the intent of the village to encourage providers to co-locate facilities in an effort to minimize the number of\ntelecommunication towers in the village's jurisdiction. All telecommunication towers over 60 feet in height must be\ndesigned and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least three wireless\ncommunication carriers, where practicable. The village encourages providers to negotiate in good faith with other\nproviders to lease space at a reasonable cost, and to publicize the fact that space is available on a lease basis as part of\nthe conditional use process or conditional district process, whichever is applicable.\n2. Co-location of additional providers on an existing tower or an upgrade of the equipment on an existing tower requires\nreview and approval by the Zoning Administrator to ensure the tower will continue to satisfy this chapter and other\napplicable requirements (including any requirements in an existing special use permit governing the tower). The\nZoning Administrator has 45 days from submission of an application, unless the village and applicant can agree on a\ndifferent timeframe, to notify the applicant that the application is incomplete, to approve the application or to deny the\napplication.\n3. Notwithstanding any other language in this division, any change to an existing tower that will increase the tower's\nheight, alter the tower's lighting or alter the painting or exterior appearance of the tower requires the issuance of a\nnew special use permit for the tower.\nD. Requirements for lots with existing use. Where a telecommunication tower is located on a lot with an existing principal\nuse, the tower shall be located in the rear yard only. An access road at least 12 feet wide shall be maintained by the\nproperty owner and/or the applicant from a public street to the tower for use by service and emergency vehicles. An\neasement shall be recorded describing and showing the location of this access road, and this easement must remain in\neffect while the tower is located on the lot. A minimum separation of 20 feet is required between telecommunication\nfacilities and any non-habitable structure on the parcel.\nE.\nCompliance with federal standards. The village recognizes that a telecommunications tower cannot be prohibited nor\ncan a special use permit/conditional district application for a tower be denied on the basis of environmental or health\nconcerns relating to radio emissions from the tower as long as that tower complies with Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) regulations concerning radio frequency emissions. The village requires that the applicant seeking to\ndevelop or modify a telecommunications tower must provide documentation showing that the tower will comply with all\nFCC regulations concerning radio frequency emissions.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n193/392\n"}, {"page": "194", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\nF. Accessory structures. To the extent reasonably feasible, all ground-level accessory structures for a telecommunications\ntower that contain switching equipment or other related equipment must be designed to closely resemble the surrounding\nneighborhood's basic architecture or the architecture and style of the principal use on the property (if the tower is not the\nprincipal use).\nG. Screening.\n1. Screening is required in the form of shrubs and/or trees along all sides of the perimeter of the telecommunication\ntower site as per \u00a7 151.046. In addition, a minimum eight-foot-high fence is required immediately around the tower\nand any associated equipment and buildings, with the screening to be located on the outside of the fenced area. It will\nbe the responsibility of the applicant to keep all screening and landscaping material free from disease and properly\nmaintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was established.\n2. The applicant, the owners of the property and any tenant on the property where screening is required shall be jointly\nand severally responsible for the maintenance of all screening materials. The maintenance shall include all actions\nnecessary to keep the screened area free of litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting areas neat\nin appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the screening shall be replaced with superior or comparable\nvegetation in the event it dies. Applicants that are building new towers that will include space for co-location shall\nplan the fence and screening to accommodate future providers such that the fence and screening will surround all\nfuture structures and the tower if the maximum number of providers co-locate on the tower.\n3. The requirements of this division may be waived or modified by the Village Council to accommodate stealth\ntechnology.\nH. Setback requirements.\n1. A minimum setback requirement in all directions from a telecommunications tower shall be:\na. One and one-half feet for every one foot of actual tower height; or\nb. The documented collapse zone, whichever is greater.\n2. For the purpose of establishing setbacks, the setback measurement shall be outward from the perimeter fencing which\nsurrounds the equipment and the tower base. No habitable structures or parcel lines shall be within the required\nsetback area.\n3. If stealth technology is used which incorporates the telecommunication equipment/facilities into another structure\n(including, but not limited to, a facade of a building, church steeple or stadium lighting) SO that collapse of the tower\nis not possible, the requirements in division (H)(1) above do not apply. Instead, the setbacks will be those applicable\nto the host structure.\nI. Lighting. Telecommunication towers having a height of 90 feet or less shall not contain lights or light fixtures at\na\nheight exceeding 15 feet, except for any lights needed for aviation safety. Furthermore, lighting for all towers shall be\ndirected toward the tower and/or its accessory uses to reduce glare onto adjacent properties.\nJ.\nDiscontinued use of tower. If the use of a telecommunications tower is discontinued for a period over 90 consecutive\ndays, the special use permit or other zoning approval for that tower shall be deemed to have expired, and the applicant\nand property owner are jointly and severally responsible for removing the tower and its associated facilities from the\nproperty within a reasonable time. It shall be the joint and several responsibility of the applicant and the property owner\nto notify the village when the use of a tower has been discontinued for over 90 consecutive days. Minimal use of a tower\nthat appears intended to avoid the application of this section shall be disregarded when determining whether a tower's\nuse has been discontinued for a period of over 90 consecutive days.\nK. Maintenance. Normal maintenance and repair of a telecommunications tower can be performed without the issuance of\na special use permit or the amendment of an existing special use permit.\nL. Freestanding signs. Freestanding signs are prohibited. Wall signs, limited to identification area, shall be allowed on\nequipment structures or fences surrounding the telecommunication tower, provided that each sign does not exceed nine\nsquare feet in size. The location, size and copy of any signage must be specifically depicted in the conditional use\napplication and permit.\nM. Proof of insurance. The applicant must show proof of adequate insurance coverage for any potential damage caused by\nor to the tower prior to the issuance of a special use permit. Once approved, every 12 months thereafter, the applicant\nmust provide documentation to the village confirming that this insurance coverage remains in effect.\nN. Storage of equipment. The outdoor storage of equipment or other related items are prohibited.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n194/392\n"}, {"page": "195", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\nO. Special use permit/conditional district application requirements. All applications for a special use permit/conditional\ndistrict for a telecommunication tower must include the following information, in addition to any other applicable\ninformation required by this section:\n1. Identification of any intended provider(s);\n2. Radiated signal strength and direction of signal;\n3. Documentation by a registered engineer that the tower has sufficient structural integrity to accommodate more than\none user;\n4. A statement from the applicant explaining how potential use of the tower by multiple providers could be\naccommodated;\n5. The applicant shall provide names and addresses of the owners of all adjacent properties and all property owners\nwithin 500 feet of the parcel where the proposed tower will be located. The village will notify these property owners\nof the Village Council's public hearing on the application;\n6. Documentation that the telecommunication tower would comply with FCC regulations concerning radio frequency\nemissions;\n7. Screening, if applicable, must be shown on the site plan that details the type and location of the screening and the\namount of plantings;\n8. Documentation of the tower's collapse area; and\n9.

To protect the unique aesthetics of the Village, to minimize new visual, aesthetic, and public safety impacts, and to\nreduce the need for additional antenna supporting structures, the Village prefers that small wireless facilities be\ncollocated on existing non-Village utility poles or wireless support structures; concealed; and have their accessory\nequipment mounted on the utility pole or wireless support structure. These preferences are intended as guidance for\ndevelopment of an application for small wireless facilities.\n2. Small wireless facilities shall cause no signal or frequency interference with public safety facilities or traffic control\ndevices and shall not physically interfere with other attachments that may be located on the existing pole or structure.\n3. No portion of a small wireless facility, to include a utility pole or Village utility pole associated with a small wireless\nfacility, may be placed in the public right-of-way in a manner that: (i) obstructs pedestrians or vehicular or bicycle\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n196/392\n"}, {"page": "197", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\naccess, obstructs sight lines or visibility for traffic, traffic signage, or signals; or interferes with access by persons with\ndisabilities.; or (ii) involves placement of pole- mounted equipment (other than cabling) whose lowest point is lower\nthan eight (8) feet above ground level. An applicant may be required to place equipment in vaults to avoid\nobstructions or interference\n4. An abandoned small wireless facility shall be removed within one hundred eighty (180) days of abandonment.\n5. Small wireless facilities located in designated historic districts or on property designated as a historic landmark shall\nbe required to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness.\n6. Small wireless facilities, and associated utility poles or Village utility poles, shall be blended with the natural\nsurroundings as much as possible. Colors and materials shall be used that are compatible with the surrounding area,\nexcept when otherwise required by applicable federal or state regulations. Small wireless facilities shall be located,\ndesigned, and/or screened to blend in with the existing natural or built surroundings to reduce the visual impacts as\nmuch as possible, and to be compatible with neighboring land uses and the character of the community.\n7. All small wireless facilities shall be stealth facilities. Antenna and accessory equipment must be shrouded or\notherwise concealed. All radios, network equipment, and batteries will be enclosed in a pedestal cabinet near the pole,\nor in a pole-mounted cabinet, or under a pole-mounted shroud.\n8. The top of a qualifying small wireless facility shall not be more than 10 feet above the building, utility pole, Village\nutility pole, or wireless support structure on which it is collocated.\n9. Utility poles and Village utility poles associated with small wireless facilities: Each modified or replacement utility\npole or Village utility pole shall not exceed (i) forty (40) feet above ground level on property zoned for or used as\nsingle family residential property, or in the right- of-way adjacent to such property, where existing utilities are\ninstalled underground, unless a variance is granted; or fifty (50) feet above ground level on all other property.\n10. Where a new pole must be installed to support a small wireless facility in a Village right of way, these additional\nstandards apply:\na. Wireless installations shall be on poles that meet or exceed current NESC standards and wind and ice loading\nrequirements of ANSI 222 Version G.\nb. Wireless installations shall be on non-conductive poles.\nC. Cabinets should be consistent in size and no larger than standard NCDOT streetlight signal cabinets.\nd. Any new poles installed shall be on an inert material, SO as not to rust or corrode and not leach any compounds or\ntoxic substances into the ground.\ne. Height of the pole must comply with NCGS 160D-936\nD. Access to Village Right of Way and Poles.\n1. Subject to N.C.G.S. 160D-936 and other applicable requirements, wireless providers may collocate small wireless\nfacilities along, across, upon, or under any Village right of way. Subject to N.C.G.S. 160D-936 and 160D-937, and\nother applicable requirements, wireless providers may place, maintain, modify, operate, or replace associated utility\npoles, Village utility poles (to the extent required by law), conduit, cable, or related appurtenances and facilities along,\nacross, upon, and under any Village right of way. The placement, maintenance, modification, operation, or\nreplacement of utility poles and Village utility poles associated with the collocation of Qualifying Small Wireless\nFacilities shall be subject to the review process outlined in Section (A) or (B) as applicable; however the Village may\nrequire additional information to evaluate loading on Village utility poles, evaluate the credentials of contractors\nworking on Village utility poles, and ensure that proposed replacement poles are consistent and compatible with other\nVillage utility poles in the area. If replacement of a Village utility pole is necessary to accommodate a small wireless\nfacility, all costs shall be borne by the applicant.\n2. A Wireless Provider may apply to place utility poles in the Village rights- of-way, or to replace or modify utility poles\nor Village utility poles in the public rights-of way, to support the collocation of small wireless facilities. Such\napplications shall be processed in accordance with the applicable sections of this Chapter. Proposals for new utility\npoles may also be evaluated for separation from existing poles in accordance with Village policies and procedures.\n3. The Village of Marvin is an excluded entity as defined under N.C.G.S. 160D-937. Nothing in the section shall be\nconstrued to require that the Village approve collocations on Village utility poles or electric poles, and such\ncollocations shall not be permitted except in accordance with Village code and policy including, without limitation,\nthe Village of Marvin Engineering Standards and Procedure Manual.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n197/392\n"}, {"page": "198", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\n4.

When conservation land in a conservation subdivision is held in multiple ownership, it shall be planned and\ndesigned as a single entity for purposes of this chapter.\nB. Density standards.\n1. The number of lots designed for single-family residential uses in a conservation subdivision shall be computed by\nusing the following formula:\nMaximum Allowable Lots = (Gross Acreage of the Tract to be Subdivided) X [0.5521 + (0.00986 X the percentage of the tract designated for\nconservation land, as rounded up to the nearest whole number)]. This translates into a maximum density of approximately 86 lots per 100 gross\nacres\n2. An example of this is as follows:\n3. In computing this formula, a figure of no greater than 31% conservation land will be used. Thus, using the above\nexample, no more than 15.5 acres (i.e., 31% of the total tract area) can be credited for calculating density.\nC. Minimum required conservation land.\n1. At least 15% of the gross area of the tract shall be permanently retained as conservation land.\n2. Note: Notwithstanding the above, the Village Council has the option of substituting a fee in lieu, which shall be held\nin a reserve account for purchase or development of recreation, park or open space sights that serve the needs of the\nresidents of the subdivision or the immediate area as described in \u00a7\u00a7 150.080 through 150.088 of the village\nsubdivision regulations, for a portion of the required conservation land outside of the viewshed buffer. If the fee-in-\nlieu option is chosen by the Village Council, the amount of required conservation land may be reduced to below 15%.\n3. Furthermore, at least 15% of the gross area of the tract shall be in conservation land that are in common or public\nownership (i.e., not located on privately held lots.) If the required viewshed buffer together with any additional\nconservation land on the tract comprise less than 15% of the tract area, except when the fee-in-lieu option is employed\nby the Village Council, the minimum lot size shall be 87,120 square feet.\n4. Certain portions of any tract being developed as a conservation subdivision shall be required to be included as\nconservation land. They include:\na. Viewshed buffers;\nb.

If a tract were to be subdivided that had an area of 100 acres (i.e., 1,500 feet of major road frontage X\n2,904 foot tract depth), the minimum viewshed buffer depth for each lot within the subdivision would be 285 feet\nas [80 + (5 x 100) = 580]. As 580 feet exceeds 285 feet, the maximum viewshed buffer required on any lot within\nthe subdivision would be 285 feet. This is less than 30% viewshed maximum buffer.\n3. If the tract borders two major roads. If the exterior of the subdivision abuts two major roads, the full viewshed buffer\nwidth shall be placed along the road with the greater length. The depth of the viewshed buffer along the shorter road\nshall be two-thirds the depth of the normally required depth of the viewshed buffer. In no case shall the depth of the\nviewshed buffer along either road be less than 85 feet as measured from the edge of the street right-of-way. The\nmaximum required depth of the viewshed buffer along either road shall be 285 feet. Furthermore, in no case shall the\nrequired viewshed buffer constitute more than 30% of the area of the tract to be subdivided.\n4. If the tract borders one major road and one minor road. The applicant shall use the formula cited above [Viewshed\nBuffer Depth (feet) = 80 + (5 X total lot or tract area)] to determine the minimum required viewshed buffer along the\nmajor road. In no case shall the depth of the required viewshed buffer on the major road be less than 85 feet as\nmeasured from the edge of the right-of-way. The maximum required depth of the viewshed buffer on the major road\nshall be 285 feet. The required depth of the viewshed buffer on the minor road shall be 85 feet. In no instance shall the\narea of the combined total of the required viewshed buffer exceed 30% of the area of the tract to be subdivided.\n5. If the tract borders one major road and any other road (i.e., a road not herein defined as a \"major road\" or a \"minor\nroad\"). The applicant shall use the formula cited above [Viewshed Buffer Depth (feet) = 80 + (5 X total lot or tract\narea)] to determine the minimum required viewshed buffer along the major road. In no case shall the depth of the\nrequired viewshed buffer on the major road be less than 85 feet as measured from the edge of the right-of-way. The\nmaximum required depth of the viewshed buffer on the major road shall be 285 feet. Notwithstanding the above, in no\ninstance shall the area of the required viewshed buffer exceed 30% of the area of the tract to be subdivided. A\nviewshed buffer shall not be required along the second road (i.e., the non-major, non-minor road). In lieu, applicable\nfront, side and/or rear setbacks shall be observed.\n6. Tract area. Tract area shall be determined using the acreage of the tract in question at the time this amendment was\nadopted (October 19, 2004) for any of the formulae shown above. A property owner shall not be allowed to\ncircumvent this requirement by an intentional or unintentional subdivision of land in order to reduce the required\nminimum viewshed buffer width.\nF. Design standards.\n1. Each building lot within the conservation subdivision must share at least one lot line with another lot in the\nsubdivision.\n2. a. In the absence of a berm:\n1. If a residential structure is visible from a major or minor road that abuts the periphery of the conservation\nsubdivision, the architectural front of the structure shall be visible from the major road; and\n2. If a lot fronts two major roads, and the ground floor of the structure is substantially visible from both major\nroads, the architectural front shall only be required to face the major road containing the road with the narrower\nviewshed buffer.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n206/392\n"}, {"page": "207", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\nb. These architectural front requirements shall be waived if a berm is placed in the viewshed or viewshed buffer and is\nbuilt in accordance with the regulations contained in division (G)(13) herein.\n3. Other than the required viewshed buffer, conservation lands (other than viewsheds) shall be at least 75 feet in width.\nExceptions may be granted for natural features used as conservation land (i.e., ponds, lakes, floodplains and the like)\nthat have natural widths of less than 75 feet.

Findings. Union County Public Schools (UCPS) is currently subject to 15 different sets of local land use regulations (14\ndifferent municipalities and Union County). Regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, making it difficult to\nbuild new schools, renovate existing schools or locate mobile units in a consistent, timely and cost effective manner.\nB. As a part of the Union County Board of Education's adopted \"Building Program Cost Saving Principles\", UCPS is\nendeavoring to establish a standard zoning classification and standardized requirements for school construction\nregardless of the schools locale in Union County. Such standardization will result in equitable school facilities\nthroughout the county; more efficient permitting of school facilities and cost savings for the benefit of the taxpayers of\nUnion County.\n1. Cooperative planning. Staffs from UCPS, Union County and local municipalities have met and have agreed to make\nrecommendations to their elected boards as follows:\na. UCPS staff will involve local municipal staff early in the site selection process. The local municipal staff will\nmake recommendations regarding target sites or areas within their respective jurisdictions that are suitable for\nschool uses. Pursuant to state statute, final decisions regarding the selection of school sites are made by the Union\nCounty Board of Education.\nb. Allow all new schools, additions, or renovation uses by right with supplemental standards. This will eliminate the\ncostly and time-consuming discretionary special use permit/zoning process and site-by-site negotiations. All local\ngovernment entities benefit by having expectations regarding school design and construction identified in advance.\nC. Jurisdictions will consider an optional SUP review process if unique conditions exist as determined by the\nZoning/Planning Administrator. The Administrator shall consider if the proposed project poses a negative impact\non the public health and safety.\n2. Supplemental standards. In the event any provisions of these supplemental regulations conflict with any other\nprovisions of this chapter or other village ordinances, then the provisions of these supplemental regulations shall\ncontrol. Other provisions in the village ordinances not in conflict with these supplemental regulations remain in\neffect. All applications are subject to the following supplemental standards.\n3.

Screening/buffering requirements may be waived when screening/buffering is already provided. There may be\ncases where the unusual topography or elevation of a site, or the size of the parcel involved, or the presence of\nscreening on adjacent property would make the strict adherence to the regulation serve no useful purpose. In those\ncases, the Zoning Administrator is empowered to waive the requirements for screening SO long as the spirit and\nintent of this section and the general provisions of this section pertaining to screening are adhered to. This section\ndoes not negate the necessity for establishing screening for uses adjacent to vacant property.\nj.

Sign height computation.\na. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the\nhighest attached component of the sign.\nb. Normal grade shall be construed to be the established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming,\nmounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.\nC. In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that\nthe elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of\na public or private street.\n5. Building frontage.\na. BUILDING FRONTAGE shall mean the horizontal length of a building on the side with its principal entrance.\nb. If that side is a straight wall, then the building frontage shall be the length of the wall.\nC. If the side is not a straight wall, the building frontage shall be the horizontal distance from the corner at one end of\nthe side of the building with the principal entrance to the other corner on the same side of the building; where that\nside of the building is concave, then the measurement shall be made in a straight line from corner to corner; where\nthe side of the building is convex or has one or more sections that project in front of the front corners, then the\nmeasurement shall be made as the shortest distance between two lines projected from the two front corners of the\nbuilding, with such lines parallel to each other and as close as practicable to perpendicular to the front of the\nbuilding.\n(Ord. 2017-10-01, passed 10-10-2017; Ord.

The village seeks to achieve uniform and coordinated signage within each development.\nCoordinated wall signage is created by consistency in the sign size, type, copy area, letters, location, color and type\nof sign. A master sign plan and schematic sign elevations are required for all signs for nonresidential uses. In\ndesigning wall signs, compliance with the following standards are required.\nk. Wall sign design. Wall signs shall only be of reverse-lit- or halo-lit-type channel lettering and design. Cabinet signs\nshall only be permitted up to a maximum of 20% of the total wall sign area, and shall only be used to display copy\nof registered trademarks and logos. Channel letters, which are part of a wall sign, may be reverse-lit or halo-lit, but\nmay not be backlit. The following designs standards shall also apply.\n1. Channel lettering placement.\n1. Channel lettering shall be located as to be centered on the building facade, or the proportionate share of the\nfacade to which it is affixed.\n2. Anchor stores are not required to have the channel letter signs located on the side or rear of the building centered\non the building facade.\n3. Copy shall all be of the same font type and color. Except for the permitted portion of the wall sign allowed for\ntrademark logos, the font colors used must comply with standards approved in a common sign plan.\n4. Channel letter faces shall be black, white and one additional color proposed and approved in the common sign\nplan. For the purpose of regulating the sign copy area and maintaining a uniform color scheme, pursuant to the\ncommon sign plan, no channel letter, regardless of the typeface used, shall be considered part of a federally\nregistered trademark for the purpose of deviating from letter color restrictions.\n5. Channel letter returns shall also be black, white and one additional color permitted in the approved master sign\nplan. However, the channel letter return must match the channel letter face.\n6. No restrictions shall be placed on the font used for channel letters that are part of a wall sign, if the font is\ncompliant with all other regulations.\n7. All wall signs shall be consistently sized and located throughout the facade of the edifice in a manner responsive\nto the architectural treatment of the building.\n8.\nWall signs on a second story shall be allowed up to 50% of the area permitted on the ground floor.\n9. If a second story is permitted, wall signs on a second story shall be permitted up to 50% of the area permitted on\nthe ground floor.\n10. If a third story is permitted, wall signs on a three-or-more-story building shall be located above the uppermost\nportion of the facade.\nm. Cabinet sign for registered trademarks. A wall sign may incorporate a federally registered trademark logo, subject\nto the following requirements.\n1. A wall sign may incorporate the use of a federally registered trademark logo as long as it is no more than 20% of\nthe permitted wall sign area.\n2. A cabinet sign may be used to display a registered trademark or logo, but the cabinet sign shall be integrated\ntogether with channel letters SO all components are viewed together as one wall sign.\n3. Any federally registered trademark or logo, permitted as part of a wall sign area, must be reverse-lit or halo-lit,\nbut may not be backlit.\n4. Design review and approval. All signs for nonresidential uses shall be subject to design review and approval,\npursuant to \u00a7 151.215.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n247/392\n"}, {"page": "248", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\nn. Channel lettering wall sign alternative. Routed, push-through signs may be considered as an alternative to channel\nlettering wall signs; provided the cabinet is black or dark brown, and all businesses within the development also\nutilize routed, push-through signs as attached identification signs.

The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the chapter and preserves its spirit.\n3. In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done.\n4.

Purpose.\n1. The Conditional District process allows for the establishment of certain uses or development projects that, because of\ntheir nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole, which cannot\nbe predetermined nor controlled by conventional district standards or codified ordinance provisions. In order to\nconsider certain types of development and protect the adjacent community, development proposed in a Conditional\nDistrict shall be subject to specific conditions, which ensure the development's compatibility with the surrounding\narea and neighboring properties.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/marvin-nc/doc-viewer.aspx#secid--1\n331/392\n"}, {"page": "332", "text": "6/26/23, 10:19 AM\nDocument Viewer I Code of Ordinances\n2.

Village Council approval of an application in no way implies another site will be found acceptable\nfor a Conditional District designation, or that similar conditions shall be acceptable for other parcels within the\nvillage's municipal boundary.\nC. General Provisions.\n1. Detailed application requirements. A rezoning to a Conditional District shall require the submittal of a detailed\napplication pursuant to division (E) of this section, illustrating uses, setbacks, architectural design elements, open\nspace, active and passive recreational opportunities, landscaping, screening and buffering, parking and vehicular\ncirculation, signage and tree preservation.\n2.

Conditions and site-specific\nstandards imposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development\nand use of the site to Village of Marvin ordinances, plans adopted pursuant to G.S. 160D-501, or the impacts\nreasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. The zoning regulation may provide that\ndefined minor modifications in conditional district standards that do not involve a change in uses permitted or the\ndensity of overall development permitted may be reviewed and approved administratively. Any other modification of\nthe conditions and standards in a conditional district shall follow the same process for approval as are applicable to\nzoning map amendments. If multiple parcels of land are subject to a conditional zoning, the owners of individual\nparcels may apply for modification of the conditions SO long as the modification would not result in other properties\nfailing to meet the terms of the conditions. Any modifications approved apply only to those properties whose owners\npetition for the modification.\n3. Engineering and consulting fees. The Zoning Administrator, Planning Board and Village Council may require that\nparticular plans or studies receive engineering, consultant or outside agency review.

At the initial meeting,\nthe Zoning Administrator will explain the conditional zoning process, and provide the applicant with an overview of\nall applicable forms, fees, ordinances, policies, and processes, and documents relevant to the project. The applicant\nshall also schedule a site walk with the Zoning Administrator in order to familiarize planning staff with the property.\nA site walk may be recommended. The Zoning Administrator may also provide the applicant with additional guidance\nin accord with the application's objectives and the proposed site plan.\n2. Pre-application meeting with the Village Council.\na. The following is a recommended step in the process. The applicant may arrange an open, work-session meeting\nwith the Village Council. This optional meeting is intended to give a prospective applicant an opportunity to gauge\nthe Council's receptiveness to two main factors prior to significant investment in an application: the Village\nCouncil's receptiveness to rezoning the land in question to a new zoning district classification, and the Village\nCouncil's receptiveness to a conceptual rezoning plan. The conceptual rezoning plan shall provide specific\ninformation about proposed type and size of uses, general configuration of principal buildings and site layout,\noverall density, setbacks, buffers, screening and architectural design.\nb. The conceptual rezoning plan required per this section will not have received review from village staff, or the\nPlanning Board. Nor will it have received conformance review, site analysis or outside agency review; therefore\nany, and all opinions offered on the part of the Village Council shall be non-binding and are provided for the\napplicant's benefit only. Should the applicant file a formal rezoning application, essential elements in the formal\nrezoning application shall be equal to, or less intense, than the conceptual plan presented to the Council during the\nVillage Council pre-application meeting. The conceptual rezoning plans shall be watermarked as 'drafts' and placed\non village media sites for public information.\n3. Application completeness, accuracy and sufficiency. An application shall be considered complete and ready for\nprocessing upon the submission of a complete application filing form, requisite fees per the adopted fee schedule,\nplans which include information required by the subdivision and zoning ordinance, and all items, documents, site\nplans, maps, elevations, and reports outlined in division (E) of this section.

If an application is deemed incomplete, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant of the determination in\nwriting and describe the application's deficiencies. No further processing or review of an incomplete application\nshall occur and no part of an incomplete application shall be distributed or scheduled for Planning Board review.\nd. To be placed back into the processing cycle an applicant must provide missing information and/or elements of an\napplication within 90 days of receipt of notification of determination. Once 90 days has expired, a new application\nfilling form and application fee shall be required and the application shall be reviewed in accord with all codified\nprocesses.\ne. If, during the course of review, the Zoning Administrator, Planning Board or Village Council determine additional\ninformation and/or plan revisions are required for their review, review procedures outlined herein shall be deferred\nuntil required documents, information and/or revisions are provided in a manner deemed sufficient by the\napplicable reviewing body.

Control filling, grading, dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase\nflood hazards to other lands.\nB. Objectives. The objectives of these floodplain regulations are:\n1. To protect human life and health;\n2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly control projects;\n3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of\nthe general public;\n4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;\n5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,\nand streets and bridges located in floodplains;\n6.

New lighting technologies have produced lights that are extremely powerful. Incorrect installation may result in\nproblems such as excessive glare, light trespass and higher energy use. Excessive glare can be annoying and may cause\nsafety problems. Light trespass reduces privacy, may be detrimental to the aesthetic values of the village and can restrict\npersons from the peaceful enjoyment of their property. Higher energy use results in increased costs for everyone. This\nchapter is intended to reduce the problems caused by excessive, poorly designed or incorrectly installed outdoor lighting.\n(Ord.

A light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light\noutput into a directed beam.\nFOOTCANDLE(S). The amount of light falling on a surface (measured or calculated). A FOOTCANDLE is defined as\none lumen per square foot.\nFOOTCANDLES (AVERAGE). The average of a number of points of footcandle calculations footcandle readings in a\ngiven area. Either initial or maintained footcandles may be specified.\nFOOTCANDLES (INITIAL). Footcandles that are calculated from the manufacturers catalog data or measured when\nlighting system is new.\nFOOTCANDLES (MAINTAINED). Footcandles that are calculated with an adjustment for a maintenance factor, to\ninclude dirt build-up in the luminaire (fixture) and reduced lumen output due to aging of the lamp, or measured after 100\nhours of operation.\nFULL CUTOFF (FULLY SHIELDED LIGHTS). Outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed SO that no light rays\nare emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report.\nGLARE. Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to see or, in extreme\ncases, cause momentary blindness.\nPRE-EXISTING LUMINAIRES. Luminaires not conforming to this chapter that were in place at the time this chapter\nwas adopted.\nMOUNTING HEIGHT OF LUMINAIRE.
