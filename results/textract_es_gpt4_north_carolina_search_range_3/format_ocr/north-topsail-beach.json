A vested right, once established as provided for in this section or by common law, precludes any\naction by the Town that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development\nor use of the property allowed by the applicable land development regulation or regulations, except where a\nchange in State or federal law mandating local government enforcement occurs after the development\napplication is submitted that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on the development or use.\n(D) Duration of Vesting.\n(1) Upon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting granted by subsection (c) of this\nsection for a development project is effective upon filing of the application in accordance with G.S. 143-755,\nfor so long as the permit remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified by this section or other\nstatute, local development permits expire one year after issuance unless work authorized by the permit has\nsubstantially commenced. A local land development regulation may provide for a longer permit expiration\nperiod. For the purposes of this section, a permit is issued either in the ordinary course of business of the\napplicable governmental agency or by the applicable governmental agency as a court directive.\n(2) Except where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or land development regulation, the\nstatutory vesting granted by this section, once established, expires for an uncompleted development project\nif development work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive\nmonths, and the statutory vesting period granted by this section for a nonconforming use of property expires\nif the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months. The\n24-month discontinuance period is automatically tolled during the pendency of any board of adjustment\nproceeding or civil action in a State or federal trial or appellate court regarding the validity of a development\npermit, the use of the property, or the existence of the statutory vesting period granted by this section.

For purposes of the vesting protections of this subsection, an erosion and sedimentation\ncontrol permit or a sign permit is not an initial development permit.\n(F) Multi-Phased Development. - A multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with\nthe land development regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase\nof the multi-phased development.

Unless otherwise expressly provided by\nthe local government, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical\nand other natural features affecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of the\nproposed buildings, structures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the\nproposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed\ninfrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-\nspecific vesting plan under this section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally determined by the\nlocal government pursuant to a development regulation, and the document that triggers the vesting shall be\nso identified at the time of its approval. A variance does not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and\napproval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained does not confer a\nvested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to\ndescribe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it\nmay not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n(B) Establishment of Vested Right. - A vested right is established with respect to any property upon the\nvalid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in this section. Such a vested\nright confers upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the\nproperty under the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any amendments thereto.\n(C) Approval and Amendment of Plans. - If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by\na local development regulation, the local government shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required\nfor that underlying approval. A duration of the underlying approval that is less than two years does not affect\nthe duration of the site-specific vesting plan established under this section. If the site-specific vesting plan is\nnot based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-602 shall be held.\n(D) A local government may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms and conditions that may\nreasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Conditional approval results in a\nvested right, although failure to abide by the terms and conditions of the approval will result in a forfeiture of\nvested rights. A local government shall not require a landowner to waive the landowner's vested rights as a\ncondition of developmental approval. A site- specific vesting plan is deemed approved upon the effective date\nof the local government's decision approving the plan or another date determined by the Board of Aldermen\nupon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the approval\nof the owner and the local government as follows: any substantial modification must be reviewed and\napproved in the same manner as the original approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff if such\nare defined and authorized by local regulation.\n(E) Continuing Review. - Following approval or conditional approval of a site-specific vesting plan, the\nTown may make subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals by the local government to ensure\ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that these reviews and\napprovals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The local government may, pursuant to G.S.\n160D-403(f), revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the\noriginal approval or the applicable local development regulations.\n(F) Duration and Termination of Vested Right. -\n(1) A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains vested for a period of two years.

Both the amount of land and\nthe type and amount of planting specified for each buffer requirement of this ordinance are designed to\nminimize nuisances between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public street. The planting units\nrequired in buffers have been calculated to ensure that they do, in fact, function as \"buffers\".\n(C) Buffers required for permits:\n(1) Buffers are required to separate different land uses from each other in order to eliminate or\nminimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, traffic, noise, glare of lights, signs and unsightly buildings or\nparking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, or danger from fires or explosions.\nThe fact that a particular land use may be permitted by right in its zoning district does not exempt it from the\nbuffering requirements;\n(2) Each application for a zoning permit or a certificate of occupancy shall include information on the\nlocation and types of buffers to be constructed or already existing. This information shall be in sufficient detail\nto enable the Zoning Administrator to determine whether the requirements of this section are being met; and\n(3) The installation of all required buffers shall be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of\noccupancy.\n(Ord. passed 11-2-2011)\n$6.04.02 LOCATION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF BUFFERS.\n(A) Buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel\nboundary line and shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or\nright-of-way. In new construction the buffer is in addition to required yards.\n(B) The installation of buffers is the responsibility of the developer. The property owner shall be\nresponsible for the maintenance of all buffers. Litter and debris shall be kept cleared and dead plants shall be\nreplaced with plants meeting the specifications in \u00a7 6.04.06. All structures shall be kept in good repair. If\nproper maintenance is not provided, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the property owner of such fact\nand, if the proper action is not taken within 30 days of such notice, the town shall be authorized to enter the\n6-10\n"}, {"page": "110", "text": "property and perform the work.

The requirements of a buffer may\nbe satisfied by any of the options under each letter designation. The number of plant materials required per\n100 feet is represented by a whole or decimal number. Both the type and number of plants is, therefore,\nspecified. All mathematical rounding shall be upwards and shall be applied to the total amount of plant\nmaterial required in the buffer, not to each 100-foot length. Smaller plant sizes are permitted adjacent to\nvacant or agricultural land.\n(A) Buffer \"A\". The requirements for buffer \"A\" shall be met by any one of the following:\n(1) Ten feet wide strip with one canopy tree, two understory trees and three shrubs per 100 linear\nfeet;\n(2) Fifteen feet wide strip with 0.8 canopy tree, 1.6 understory tree, and 2.4 shrubs per 100 linear feet;\n(3) Twenty feet wide strip with 0.6 canopy tree, 1.2 understory tree, and one and 1.8 shrubs per 100\nlinear feet; or\n(4) Twenty-five feet wide strip with 0.4 canopy tree, 0.8 understory tree, and 1.2 shrubs per 100 linear\nfeet.\n(B) Buffer \"B\".
