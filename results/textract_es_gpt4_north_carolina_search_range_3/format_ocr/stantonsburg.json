Principal uses are the primary, permanent use types proposed on a lot (like a single-\nfamily home).\n2. Accessory uses are subordinate to the principal use located on the same lot (like a\ndetached garage serving a single-family home) and may be a structure or an activity.\n3.

Uses in complexes shall be limited to those permitted within the zoning district in which\nthe project is located.\n2. The overall intensity of land use shall be no higher, and the standard of open space no\nlower, than that permitted in the district in which the project is located.\n3.

ZONING COMPLIANCE PERMIT\nA site plan approval authorizes the submittal of or review of an application for a\nzoning compliance permit. In cases where the Town Manager determines that a\nzoning compliance permit is not required, then an applicant may file an\napplication for a building permit.\n02. CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS\n100. Construction drawings for all public infrastructure included with or filed\nsubsequent to the site plan application shall be approved prior to street and\nutility construction in accordance with the applicable Town standards.\n200. In the case of a multi-phase Site Plan, any street and utility construction\nplans shall include all improvements within a phase and all public\nimprovements outside the phase but necessary to serve development within\nthat phase.\n11. SPECIAL USE PERMIT\ni. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThis special use permit procedure defines the process for consideration of a proposed\nuse type that may be allowable in a zoning district, but because of its nature or\npotential deleterious effects, it requires special consideration of its location, design,\nand methods of operation before it can be deemed appropriate in the district and\ncompatible with its surroundings.\nii. APPLICABILITY\n01. Uses identified as requiring a special use permit in the Table of Principal Uses\nshall be approved in accordance with the procedures and standards of this\nsection.\n02. In cases where a single use type located within a larger multi-building or multi-\nuse development requires a special use permit, only that particular use type and\nthe lot it is located upon shall be subject to the special use permit, not the entire\ndevelopment.\niii. APPLICATION\n01. A complete application for a special use permit shall include a site plan depicting\nthe proposed use and site configuration.\niv. DECISION\n01. A decision by the Board of Adjustment shall be based on the competent,\nmaterial, and substantial evidence in the record, as supplemented by arguments\npresented at the evidentiary hearing, and the standards in this ordinance.\n02. The decision shall be one of the following:\n100. Approval of the special use permit, as submitted;\n200. Approval of a special use permit with conditions; or\n300.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this variance procedure is to allow deviations from certain standards\nof this Ordinance when the landowner demonstrates that, owing to special\ncircumstances or conditions beyond the landowner's control (such as topographical\nconditions, narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific parcel of land), a literal\napplication of the standards would result in undue and unique hardship to the\nlandowner and the deviation would not be contrary to the public interest.\nii. APPLICABILITY\n01. VARIANCE\n100. Development that would otherwise be subject to undue and unique hardship\nfrom the applications of the standards in this Ordinance may seek relief\nfrom the standards in accordance with this section.\n200. No variance may be sought to permit uses not allowed in a zoning district.\n300. No variance may be sought that increases development density (e.g., units\nper acre) beyond the maximum permitted in the zoning district where\nlocated.\n02. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION\n100. In cases where the strict application of the standards of this Ordinance\nwould deprive an eligible person of their right to equal opportunity to use a\ndwelling under the federal Fair Housing Act, the person may apply for a\nReasonable Accommodation in accordance with this section.\n200. For the purposes of this section, an \"eligible person\" is a person who meets\nthe definition of a disabled or handicapped person under federal law.\n300. A person recovering from substance abuse is considered a person with a\ndisability or handicap provided they are not currently engaging in the illegal\nuse of controlled substances.\niii. APPLICATION\n01. Applications for variances and reasonable accommodations shall be processed\nby the Town Manager.\n02. An application for reasonable accommodation may be made by a person with a\ndisability or handicap, or their legal representative, or by a provider of housing\nfor persons with disabilities or handicaps. An application for reasonable\naccommodation shall also include the following:\n100. The basis for the claim that the applicant or persons receiving services from\nthe applicant is considered disabled or handicapped under federal law;\n200. The Ordinance provision from which the reasonable accommodation is being\nrequested; and\n300. An explanation of why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to\nmake specific land or development available for the applicant.\niv. DECISION\n01. The decision shall be based on the competent, material, and substantial evidence\nin the record, as supplemented by arguments presented at the evidentiary\nhearing, and the standards of this ordinance.\n02.

REQUIRED FINDINGS\nA variance application shall be approved provided on a finding the applicant\ndemonstrates all of the following:\n100. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the\nOrdinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of\nthe variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\n200. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such\nas location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal\ncircumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are\ncommon to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis\nfor granting a variance.\n300. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the\nlandowner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of the variance shall not\nbe regarded as a self-created hardship.\n400. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of\nthe Ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is\nachieved.\n500. The variance approval is the minimum necessary to make possible the\nreasonable use of the land, building, or structure.\n02. NOT AVAILABLE AS BASIS FOR DECISION\nNone of the following may be used as the basis for approving a variance:\n100. Hardships resulting from factors other than application of the relevant\nstandards of this Ordinance;\n200. Personal circumstances;\n300. A request for a particular use that is expressly, or by inference, prohibited\nin the zoning district;\n400. Hardships resulting from factors other than application of the relevant\nstandards of this Ordinance;\n500. The fact that land or a structure may be utilized more profitably or be more\nmarketable with a variance; or\n600. Financial hardship.\nvi. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION\n01. A reasonable accommodation application shall be approved on a finding the\nproposed accommodation:\n100.

If circumstances render this impracticable, adequate provision for\nthe concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street shall be furnished by the\nsubdivider. Where there exists a half-street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining\nhalf shall be provided by the proposed subdivision. However, in circumstances where\nmore than 60 feet of right- of-way is required, a partial width right-of-way, not less\nthan 60 feet in width, may be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped property is owned\nor controlled by the subdivider; provided that the width of the partial dedication is\nsuch as to permit the installation of such facilities as may be necessary to serve\nTown of Stantonsburg, NC\nLast Updated:\nPAGE 367\nCode of Ordinances\nJune 19, 2023\n"}, {"page": "111", "text": "DIVISION 2 PART 9 CHAPTER 9.2 UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nART. 9.2.9.
