Purpose. Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the\nproperty is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions\nimposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular\nproperty. The following zoning district categories are conditional zoning districts:\nConditional Residential District\nConditional Office and Institutional District\nConditional Business District\nConditional Industrial District\nConditional Mixed-use Residential District\nConditional Mixed-use Commercial District\nA conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific\nstandards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of\nsuch a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area\nand on the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district\nstandards. There are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use\nby right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if\nproperly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these\nregulations, the adopted land use plan, and adopted district and area plans. The review process\nestablished in this section provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of\nproperty into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility\nof the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A conditional zoning district is\ngenerally not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal, except when that proposal is\nconsistent with an approved district or area plan or the proposal can demonstrate that public\ninfrastructure needed to serve the development will be made available in a reasonable time period.\nB. Plans and other information to accompany petition\n1)\nProperty may be rezoned to a conditional zoning district only in response to and consistent with\na petition submitted by the owners of all of the property to be included in the district. A petition\nfor conditional zoning must include a preliminary site plan and supporting information and text\nthat specifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations, and\nconditions that, in addition to all predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the\ndevelopment and use of the property. The following information must be provided, if\napplicable:\na)\nA boundary survey and vicinity map showing the property's total acreage, its zoning\nclassification(s), the general location in relation to major streets, railroads, and/or\nwaterways, the date, and north arrow;\nb) All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way;\n31\nprinted on\nDevelopment Ordinances\nMay 12, 2021\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "c) Areas in which structures will be located;\nd) Proposed use of all land and structures, including the number of residential units and the\ntotal square footage of any nonresidential development;\ne) All yards, buffers, screening, and landscaping required by these regulations or proposed by\nthe petitioner;\nf)\nAll existing and proposed points of access to public streets;\ng) Watershed locations and delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on\nthe Official Flood Insurance Rate Maps;\nh) Proposed phasing, if any;\ni) The location of existing and proposed storm drainage patterns and facilities intended to\nserve the proposed development; and\nj) Generalized traffic, parking, and circulation plans.\n2) The Planner has the authority to waive any application requirement where the type of use or\nscale of proposal makes providing that information unnecessary or impractical.\n3) In the course of evaluating the proposed use, the Planner, planning board, or City council may\nrequest additional information from the petitioner. This information may include the following:\na) Proposed number and general location of all structures;\nb) Proposed screening, buffers and landscaping over and above that required by these\nregulations, as well as proposed treatment of any existing natural features;\nc) Existing and general proposed topography, if available, at five-foot contour intervals or less;\nd) The location of significant trees on the subject property;\ne) Scale of buildings relative to abutting property;\nf) Height of structures;\ng) Exterior features of proposed development;\nh) Any other information needed to demonstrate compliance with these regulations; and\ni) Proposed number and location of signs.\n4) The preliminary site plan and any supporting text shall constitute part of the petition for all\npurposes under this Section.\n32\nprinted on\nDevelopment Ordinances\nMay 12, 2021\n"}, {"page": "44", "text": "5) The Planner may require the petitioner to submit more than one copy of the petition and\npreliminary site plan in order to have enough copies available to circulate to other government\nagencies for review and comment.\nC.\nApproval of conditional zoning district. Conditional zoning district decisions are a legislative process\nsubject to judicial review using the same procedures and standard of review as apply to general use\ndistrict zoning decisions. In considering any petition for a conditional zoning district, the Council\nshall act in accordance with Section 10.83, \"Action by City council.\" Conditional zoning district\ndecisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted land use plans for the area,\nincluding, but not limited to, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, area plans,\nneighborhood plans, corridor plans, and other land-use policy documents.\nD. Conditions to approval of petition. In approving a petition for the reclassification of property to a\nconditional zoning district, the planning board may recommend, and the City council request, that\nreasonable and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Any such conditions\nshould relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support\nfacilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems,\nscreening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements,\nwater and sewer improvements, storm water drainage, the provision of open space, and other\nmatters that the City council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose.

The petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and\nrespond to any such conditions prior to final action by the City council.\nE. Effect of approval\n1) If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall\nbe governed by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the district's category,\nthe approved preliminary site plan for the district, and any additional approved rules,\nregulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved\ndistrict and are binding on the property as an amendment to these regulations and to the\nZoning Map.\n2) If a petition is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all requirements established for\nobtaining a building permit and certificate of occupancy. Only those uses and structures\nindicated in the approved petition and preliminary site plan shall be allowed on the subject\nproperty. Minor revisions may be authorized pursuant to Section 10.347(b)(4) Administrative\nAmendments\n3) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall\nbe identified on the Zoning Map by the appropriate district designation.\n4) Any conditional zoning district shall have vested rights pursuant to N.C.G.S. Section 160D-102\nand 160D-108 for the period of time established pursuant to Division 12, Vested Rights, of this\nDevelopment Ordinance, except as such vested rights may be altered as allowed by N.C.G.S.\nSection 160D-108(b).

Unless otherwise\nexpressly provided by the local government, the plan shall include the approximate\nboundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features affecting\ndevelopment of the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the\nproposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and\nproposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways.\nWhat constitutes a site-specific vesting plan shall be defined by the relevant development\nregulation, and the development approval that triggers vesting shall be so identified at the\ntime of its approval. At a minimum, the regulation shall designate a vesting point earlier than\nthe issuance of a building permit. In the event a local government fails to adopt a regulation\nsetting forth what constitutes a site-specific vesting plan, any development approval shall be\nconsidered to be a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a site-specific\nvesting plan and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be\nobtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If\na sketch plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and\nintensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-\nspecific vesting plan.\nd. Process for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. - If a site-specific vesting\nplan is based on an approval required by a local development regulation, the local\ngovernment shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying\napproval. If the duration of the underlying approval is less than two years, that shall not affect\nthe duration of the site-specific vesting plan established under this subdivision. If the site-\nspecific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as\nrequired by G.S. 160D-602 shall be held. A local government may approve a site-specific\nvesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the\npublic health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right,\nalthough failure to abide by its terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of vested rights.\nA local government shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a condition of\n105\nCity of Graham Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "117", "text": "developmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the\neffective date of the local government's decision approving the plan or such other date as\ndetermined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and\nits conditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the local government as\nfollows: any substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as\nthe original approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and\nauthorized by local regulation.\n(c) Seven years - Multiphase developments. - A multiphase development shall be vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the zoning regulations, subdivision regulations, and unified development\nordinances in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase\ndevelopment. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan\napproval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase development. For purposes of this\nsubsection, \"multiphase development\" means a development containing 25 acres or more that: (i) is\nsubmitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase, and (ii) is subject\nto a master development plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for\npublic use as a condition of its master development plan approval.\n(d) Indefinite - Development agreements. - A vested right of reasonable duration may be specified in a\ndevelopment agreement approved by the City of Graham City council.\n(e) Permit Choice. - If an application made in accordance with local regulation is submitted for a\ndevelopment approval required pursuant to NC General Statutes Chapter 160D and a development\nregulation changes between the time the application was submitted and a decision is made, the\napplicant may choose which version of the development regulation will apply to the application. If\nthe development permit applicant chooses the version of the rule or ordinance applicable at the\ntime of the permit application, the development permit applicant shall not be required to await the\noutcome of the amendment to the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development\npermit. This section applies to all development approvals issued by the State and by local\ngovernments. The duration of vested rights created by development approvals is as set forth in\nsubsection (b) of this section.\n(f) Zoning Permit Required. A zoning permit is required before commencing work on any project in\nwhich a vested right exists.\n(1) The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall issue the zoning permit for a project in which the vested\nright has been conferred by a special use permit or a conditional use permit.\n(2) In any other case, an applicant shall apply for a zoning permit with vested rights as outlined in\nSection 256 below.\nSection 10.256\nApplication for a Zoning Permit with Vested Rights\n(a)\nSubmission of Site-specific Development Plan. The applicant shall submit 10 copies of a site-specific\ndevelopment plan drawn to scale describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use\nof the specific parcel or parcels of land.

Upon receipt of a properly prepared site-specific development plan, the Zoning\nEnforcement Officer shall arrange to bring the plan before the City council in the manner of a public\nhearing. Completed plans shall be received a minimum of 15 days before the public hearing at\nwhich the proposed vested rights plan is scheduled to be considered by the Council.\nIn considering an application for a zoning permit with vested rights, the City council shall give due\nregard to whether issuance of the permit would serve the purpose and intent of this ordinance,\nsecure public safety and welfare and do substantial justice. If the Council should find, after public\nhearing, that the proposed permit should not be granted, the permit should be denied.\n(c) Findings. In granting a zoning permit with vested rights the City council shall make the following\naffirmative findings:\n(1) the use requested is among those permitted in the district in which the property is located\nand complies with all the requirements of this and other applicable ordinances;\n(2) the requested permit is either essential or desirable for the public convenience or welfare;\n(3) the requested permit will not impair the integrity or character of the surrounding or adjoining\ndistricts and will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the community;\n(4) adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, sanitation and/or other necessary facilities have\nbeen or are being provided.\nIn granting a zoning permit with vested rights, the City council may impose such additional\nrestrictions and requirements upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose\nand intent of this ordinance are served, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\nApproval of a site-specific development plan with the condition that a variance or modification be\nobtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance or modification is\nobtained. If all requirements and conditions are accepted by the applicant, the Council shall\nauthorize the issuance of the permit; otherwise the permit shall be denied. Any permit so\nauthorized shall remain vested for two years from the date of the action granting the Permit.\n(d)\nViolations. Any violation of a term of condition involved the granting of a zoning permit with vested\nrights shall be treated the same as a violation of this ordinance and shall be subject to the same\nremedies and penalties as any such violation. In addition, the City council may, after public hearing,\nrevoke any such vested rights for failure to abide by any such term or condition.\n107\nCity of Graham Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "119", "text": "Section 10.257\nOther Ordinances Apply\nThe establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning which imposes\nadditional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or\nregulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation,\nincluding, but not limited to, building, fire, mechanical, electrical and plumbing codes.\nSection 10.258\nChanges or Amendments\nNo change or amendment to any zoning permit with vested rights shall be made except after public\nhearing and except as provided for in this ordinance for the original issuance or such permit. If, at the\ntime of consideration of a proposed change or amendment to an existing permit, the permit or\nproposed change or amendment could not be lawfully made under ordinance conditions existing at that\ntime, the proposed change or amendment shall be denied. In addition, in no case shall there be an\nextension of the two-year time period for which the development right is vested. Nothing herein shall\nexempt plans related to the permit from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with\nthe terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not\ninconsistent with the original approvals.\nSection 10.259\nStatus of Expiration of Term\nA right, which has been vested, shall terminate at the end of the two to five-year vesting period, as\nidentified in G.
