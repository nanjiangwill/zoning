Permits Required\nThe use made of property may not be substantially changed, substantial clearing, grading or excavation may not be\ncommenced, and buildings or other substantial structures may not be constructed, erected, moved, or substantially\naltered except in accordance with and pursuant to the appropriate permit.\nFor purposes of this Section, buildings or other substantial structures within any Business District shall be deemed\n\"substantially altered\", thereby requiring the issuance of either a zoning or special use permit, if the applicant proposes\nto change in any significant manner the exterior appearance of said building or other substantial structure or makes\nstructural repairs or modifications of fifty percent (50%) or more of the structure's tax value.\nSection 901. Who May Submit Permit Applications\nApplications development approval will be accepted only from persons having the legal authority to take action in\naccordance with the permit. By way of illustration, in general this means that applications should be made by the\nowners or lessees of property, or their agents, or persons who have contracted to purchase property contingent upon\ntheir ability to acquire the necessary permits under this ordinance, or the agents of such persons (who may make\napplication in the name of such owners, lessees, or contract vendees).\nThe Administrator may require an applicant to submit evidence of his authority to submit the application in accordance\nwith this section whenever there appears to be a reasonable basis for questioning this authority.\nSection 902. Applications to be Complete\nAll applications for development approval must be complete before the permit issuing authority is required to consider\nthe application.\nDetailed or technical design requirements and construction specifications relating to various types of improvements\n(streets, sidewalks, etc.) are set forth in one or more illustrations contained in this ordinance. It is not necessary that the\napplication contain the type of detailed construction drawings that would be necessary to determine compliance with\nthese illustrations, so long as the plans provide sufficient information to allow the permit issuing authority to evaluate\nthe application in the light of the substantive requirements set forth in the text of this ordinance. However, whenever\nthis ordinance requires a certain element of a development to be constructed in accordance with the detailed\nrequirements set forth in one or more of these illustrations, then no construction work on such element may be\ncommenced until detailed construction drawings have been submitted to and approved by the Administrator. Failure to\nobserve this requirement may result in permit revocation or other penalty as provided in this ordinance.\nAn application is complete when it contains all of the information that is necessary for the permit issuing authority to\ndecide whether or not the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this\nordinance.\nThe presumption established is that all of the information set forth in this ordinance is necessary to satisfy the\nrequirements of this section. However, it is recognized that each development is unique, and therefore the permit\nissuing authority may allow less information or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of\nthe\nparticular case. For applications submitted to the Town Council or Design Review Committee, the applicant may rely in\nthe first instance on the recommendations of the Zoning Administrator as to whether more or less information should\nbe submitted.\n47\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "The Zoning Administrator shall make every effort to develop application forms, instructional sheets, checklists, or other\ntechniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and the form and type of\ninformation that must be submitted.

Staff Consultation before Formal Application\nTo minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and ensure compliance with the\nrequirements of this ordinance, pre-application consultation between the developer and the Zoning Administrator is\nencouraged and required as provided in this section.\nBefore submitting an application for any permit, developers are strongly encouraged to consult with the Zoning\nAdministrator concerning the application of this ordinance to the proposed development.\nSection 904. Staff Consultation after Application Submitted\nUpon receipt of a formal application for a development approval the Zoning Administrator shall review the application\nand confer with the applicant to ensure that he understands the Zoning Administrator's interpretation of the applicable\nrequirements of this ordinance, that he has submitted all of the information that he intends to submit, and that the\napplication represents precisely and completely what he proposes to do.\nIf the Zoning Administrator believes that the application is incomplete, he shall recommend to the appropriate board\nthat the application be denied on that basis.\nSection 905. Application to be Processed Expeditiously\nRecognizing that inordinate delays in acting upon appeals or applications may impose unnecessary cost on the appellant\nor applicant, the Town shall make every reasonable effort to process appeals and permit applications as expeditiously as\npossible, consistent with the need to ensure that all development conforms to the requirements of this ordinance.\nSection 906. Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns\nUnless provided otherwise by law all rights, privileges, benefits, burdens, and obligations created by a development\napproval pursuant to this ordinance attach to and run with the land.\nDevelopment approvals authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a particular way. Such permits are\ntransferable.

No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or\nstructures covered under such permit for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance with all\nthe terms and requirements of that permit\n2. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered under the\npermit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was\nobtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered\nproperty and wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was\noriginally issued.

The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or\ntopography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from\nconditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for\ngranting a variance.

The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that\npublic safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved. No change in permitted uses may be\nauthorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the\nconditions are reasonably related to the variance.
