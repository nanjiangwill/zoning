Charge for replacing existing overhead service with underground\nservice shall be determined by the Public Utility Director based on the actual cost to install the service. Note: this covers\nreplacement of only the existing overhead service with underground service from the last pole of an overhead distribution line to\nthe residence.\n(1) The terms UNDERGROUND FACILITIES or BELOW-GROUND FACILITIES as used herein mean an electrical\ndistribution system having all conductors installed below ground level. The cost of transformer, circuit breakers and other facilities\nassociated with such a conductor is included in the uniform charges set out above, but at the town's option they may be installed\nabove or below ground level.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/downlo\n24/322\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(2) Bulk feeders or sub-feeders: a bulk feeder is a conductor system transporting the total energy requirements of a large\narea from a sub-station or other supply point into the area, which may consist of several residential developments and other\nloads. A sub-feeder is a conductor system branching off of the bulk feeder to supply the requirements of a certain portion of\nthe\nlarge area. The sub-feeder may terminate in a given development, but the bulk feeder may or may not pass through the\ndevelopment to serve adjacent areas.\n(a) Existing overhead bulk distribution feeders will remain installed overhead unless the owner (hereinafter deemed to\ninclude a builder, developer, contractor or customer) desires to have them installed underground. Bulk distribution feeders,\nnecessary to serve a new underground residential subdivision will be installed underground. In those cases, the owner will make\na contribution in aid of construction equal to the estimated differences in cost between underground and overhead facilities.\n(b) If it is necessary to extend a bulk distribution feeder through an existing underground residential development, it will be\ninstalled underground at the town's expense.\n(3) Development must be divided into established and defined lots. For the purpose of determining the uniform charge per\nlot, the average size of lots will be expressed in square feet.\n(4) The uniform charge per lot or per trench foot is based only on those facilities required to serve the residence or the\ndevelopment involved. The uniform charge per lot or per trench foot includes the cost of individual services. Where the trench\nfootage price is applicable, the charge will be based on the number of feet of primary and secondary trench. Services will be\ninstalled at no additional charge as residences are completed.\n(5) Single phase: the uniform charge per lot or trench foot is based only on those distribution facilities, including local\nprimary voltage loops, transformers and associated facilities required to provide the residences with utilization voltage (single\nphase, 120/240 volts).\n(6) Replacing overhead service with underground service:\n(a) There will be added to the uniform charge per service the actual cost brought about in connection with the compliance\nof special requirements, if any, of municipalities State and Federal Highway Commission or Bureau; regarding the breaking of\npavement ditching, backfilling and other related conditions;\n(b) Should existing sidewalks, septic tank systems, fuel tanks, other utility lines or other obstructions result in additional\nexpenses to the town, payment for same will be made by the owner;\n(c) Each owner must arrange the wiring in the residence to receive service at a meter location, which will allow an\nunimpeded installation of the underground service facilities; and\n(d) The town's agreement to provide underground service is dependent upon the owner's securing all necessary\neasements, rights, rights-of- way, privileges, franchises or permits for the installation of the service. Shrubs, trees and grass sod\nrequiring protection from the town's equipment during installation of underground facilities will be the responsibility of the owner,\nwho will also re-seed the trench cover.\n(C) Miscellaneous.\n(1) Town-owner coordination. Prior to the installation of the underground distribution system by the town, the final grade\nlevels of the building sites will be established by the owner. The building construction program will be coordinated with the\ninstallation of underground electrical facilities to permit unimpeded access of the town's equipment to the installation sites; to\nallow installation of underground facilities at proper depth and before streets, curbs or other obstructions are installed; and to\neliminate dig-ins to the underground electrical facilities after installation. Should streets, curbs or other obstructions be installed\nprior to installation of underground facilities, resulting in additional expense to the town, payment for these additional expenses\nwill be made to the town by the owner. Should established lots or final grade change after installation of underground electrical\nfacilities have begun, or if installation of electrical facilities are required by the customer before final grades are established, and\neither of these conditions results in additional expenses to the town, payment for these additional expenses will be made to the\ntown by the owner.\n(2) Temporary service. Temporary service will not be available in the area served from underground facilities until the\nunderground system is in place, unless the owner elects to pay the \"in and out\" costs of temporary facilities necessary to deliver\nthe temporary service from overhead distribution lines. After the underground facilities are in place, temporary service may be\nprovided, but only at a transformer or pedestal location.\n(3) Street and area lights. Underground conductors to provide service to street lights will be installed at no cost concurrently\nwith the installation of an underground system for a new residential development. If the owner(s) subsequently desires that street\nlighting be furnished, the town will provide some under the applicable rate schedule. With respect to facilities to provide\nunderground service for area lights under all other conditions, the owner will be required to make a contribution equal to the\ndifference in cost, if any, between underground and overhead facilities. Area lighting service will be furnished under the applicable\nrate schedule.\n(4) Adverse conditions. If the composition of the land where facilities are to be installed is such that standard construction\nequipment cannot be used to complete the installation and special equipment and materials needed for stream-crossing\nstructures, concrete structures and dynamite are required and this composition of land is encountered in over 40% of the trench\nfootage, and if abrupt changes in final grade levels exceed a three-foot drop in depth within three feet of horizontal trenching, the\ntown will adjust the standard charges to collect the actual additional cost to the town.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n25/322\n"}, {"page": "26", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(Prior Code, \u00a7 G-I-12) (Ord. passed 2-6-1973)\n\u00a7 52.13 RIGHT OF ACCESS.\nThe town shall have the right of access to the customer's premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of reading meters of\nthe town and of removing its property, and for any other proper purpose in connection with the electric service; and the town shall\nhave the right to discontinue the supply of electricity without notice if the access at any time is not provided.

LOSS DUE TO RETIREMENT OF EXISTING ABOVE-GROUND FACILITIES is\ndefined as follows: original cost of the above-ground facilities less accrued depreciation less salvage, plus cost of removal. It is\nnecessary to make preliminary engineering studies to determine the approximate costs of replacing overhead with underground\nfacilities. Persons requesting replacement of existing facilities, which serve predominately residential areas, must pay in advance\nof the town's undertaking the study, a good faith, nonrefundable deposit of $100 per each 600 feet of front lot line. For the\nreplacement of facilities serving all other areas, estimated cost of the preliminary engineering study necessary must be paid\nbefore the study is undertaken. If the replacement is undertaken following completion of the studies, the actual engineering costs;\nincluding preliminary engineering studies, will be charged, and credit will be given for the estimated cost which was advanced.\n(B) The town need not replace existing overhead systems with underground facilities, except individual services from pole to\nresidence, unless at least one block or 600 feet of front line is involved, whichever is less.\n(C) All customers served from the section or area of line to be replaced with underground facilities must agree to the\nconditions outlined for replacement of overhead facilities.\n(D) Each owner must arrange the wiring in the residence to receive service at a meter location which will allow an unimpeded\ninstallation of the underground service facilities.\n(E) The town's agreement to provide underground service is dependent upon the securing of all necessary rights, easements,\nrights-of-way, privileges, franchises or permits for the installation of such service by those requesting replacement. Shrubs, trees\nand grass sod requiring protection from the town's equipment during installation of underground facilities will be the responsibility\nof the individual owner. Re-seeding of trench will be done by the individual owner.\n(Prior Code, \u00a7 G-IV)\n\u00a7 52.16 ESTIMATES.\n(A) Estimates of the cost of the below-ground and above-ground facilities, for the purpose of determining the amount of the\ncontribution in aid of construction, will be in accord with the town's current construction design practice and shall be based upon\nthe equivalent conductor and transformer capacity required for the electrical load, specified by the owner.\n(B) Estimates shall not vary with, or take into consideration the end usage of electricity or the revenue to be produced by\nthose requesting underground service. In situations where joint trenching is used for the installation of both power and telephone\ncables, any cost reductions resulting from the joint use will be passed on in the form of credits against the estimated costs, to the\nperson(s) making contributions in aid for underground installations.

All entities thereafter who intend or propose to attach to the town's power poles shall apply in writing to\nthe Electric Utility Director for a permit. The town shall charge $250 for such permit.\n(2) (a) From and after the effective date of this section, the town, as grantor owning certain poles within its service area,\nshall permit the attachment of cables, wires, fiber-optics and apparatus to such poles upon the submission and approval of a\npermit application by the grantee. The town shall not unreasonably withhold such approval. In general, however, approval will not\nbe granted for the attachment to any pole of more than one strand in any one direction, exclusive of service drop cables\noriginating on the pole or nearest main line pole of the town.\n(b) All permittees shall pay the same rate per pole, per annum, as set forth in the town's adopted annual fee schedule.\n(3) It shall be unlawful to attach or connect any cable, wire, fiber-optic, support cable, power supply, communication or signal\ndevice, camera, antenna, and the like to grantor's poles without a permit issued by the Director of the Electric Utility. Failure to\nobtain a permit shall cause the town to immediately remove the attachment(s) and/or device(s) from unpermitted poles at the\nviolator's exclusive expense.\n(E) Maintenance of attachments in safe condition. The grantee shall, at its own expense, make and maintain all of its\nattachments and facilities in safe condition and in thorough repair, and in a manner acceptable to the town and so that the\nattachments and facilities will not conflict with or alter existing equipment or use of the poles by the town, or by other utility\nproviders using or having the right to use the poles, or interfere with the working use of facilities thereon, or which may from time\nto time be placed thereon. The grantee shall, at any time, at its own expense, upon notice from the town, relocate, replace or\nrenew its facilities placed on the poles and transfer them to substitute poles, or perform any other work in connection with the\nfacilities that may be required by the town, provided, however that in cases of emergency, the town may arrange to relocate,\nreplace or renew the facilities placed on the poles by the grantee, transfer them to substituted poles or perform any other work in\nconnection with said facilities that may be required in the maintenance, replacement, removal or relocation of the poles, the\nfacilities thereon, or which may be placed thereon, or for the service needs of the town, and the grantee shall, on demand,\nreimburse the town the complete expenses thereby incurred.\n(F) Construction and technical standards.\n(1) The grantee's cables, wires, fiber-optics or apparatus, in each and every location, shall be erected and maintained in\naccordance with the requirements and specifications of the National Electrical Safety Code, and any revisions or amendments\nof\nthe Code and safety requirements of the town, and in compliance with any rules or orders now in effect or that may hereafter be\nissued by the State Regulatory Authority, or other authority having jurisdiction. The grantee shall not install any facilities on the\ntown's poles which will make the poles unsafe, overburdened, or unsightly in appearance. The town has the right to refuse\nattachment by the grantee of its facilities if, in the opinion of the town, the attachment will render the poles unsafe, overburdened\nor unsightly in appearance. The town shall designate the location of the grantee's attachments to the poles of town in accordance\nwith the requirements and specifications of the National Electrical Safety Code and the town's outstanding obligation to others as\nto the use of the poles.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n27/322\n"}, {"page": "28", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(2) In the event that any pole or poles of the town to which the grantee desires to make attachments are inadequate to\nsupport the additional facilities in accordance with the aforesaid specifications, the grantee will notify the town of any deficiency.

If in the town's opinion, the grantee has not taken such necessary\nprecautions, the town shall have the right to terminate the permission herein granted upon 30 days written notice to the grantee.\nHowever, the town shall not be considered in any way responsible for the adequacy or inadequacy of such precautions of the\ngrantee. The town shall have the right to remove immediately and without notice any attachment which could place the town's\nfacilities or system, or the public at large, in danger.\n(M) Removal of attachments.\n(1) The grantee may at any time remove its attachments from any pole or poles of the town but shall immediately give\nwritten notice of the removal to the town.

Therefore, the Board of Aldermen of the town,\ndoes ordain as follows.\n(B) Findings of fact.\n(1) The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life,\nproperty, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of\nflood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general\nwelfare.\n(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights\nand velocities and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\n(C) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to\nminimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to:\n(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result\nin damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve the uses, be protected against flood damage at the\ntime of initial construction;\n(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the\naccommodation of flood waters;\n(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and\n(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood\nhazards to other lands.\n(D) Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:\n(1) Protect human life, safety and health;\n(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the\ngeneral public;\n(4) Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines,\nstreets and bridges) that are located in flood-prone areas;\n(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood- prone areas; and\n(7) Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.\n(Ord. passed 9-28-2007)\n\u00a7 151.02 DEFINITIONS.\nFor the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different\nmeaning.\nACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).

All required parking or loading spaces shall be located on the same\nzoning lot as the principal use(s) it serves, except as approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Off-site parking for a permitted\nuse, as required by this chapter, can be used, subject to certification by the Zoning Enforcement Officer that the following\nrequirements have been met:\n1. The use being served by the off-site parking is a permitted principal use in the zoning district within which the lot\ncontaining such parking is located;\n2. The off-site parking spaces are located within a walking distance of 500 feet to a public entrance to the structure or\nland area containing the use for which such spaces are required;\n3. A safe, direct, attractive, lighted and convenient pedestrian route exists or will be provided between the off-site parking\nand the use being served;\n4. The continued availability of off-site parking spaces necessary to meet the requirements of this section are insured by\nan appropriate restriction on the title to the land providing the off-site parking spaces, in the form of a declaration, covenant, or\ncontract.\n(e) Combined parking.\n1. Up to one-half of the parking spaces required for one use may be used to satisfy the parking requirements for either a\nsecond use on the same zoning lot or a use for which the provisions of division (11)(c) above are utilized, subject to certification\nby the Zoning Enforcement Officer that such joint usage of parking complies with the following provisions:\na.\nThe peak usage of the parking facility by one use will be at night or on Sundays (such as with theaters, assembly\nhalls, or churches), and the peak usage of the parking facility by the second will be at other times; or\nb.\nThe second use is an ancillary use to the first use, such as restaurants and meeting rooms to hotels and motels.\n(f) Use of required parking and loading areas. Parking areas shall be used for parking automobiles, motorcycles and\npassenger trucks only, with no sales, storage, repair work, dismantling, or service of any kind permitted. Required loading space\nshall be available for the loading and unloading of vehicles, and shall not be used for the storage of vehicles or material, or to\nmeet off-street parking requirements.\n(g) Parking lot landscaping require-ments.\n1. The intent of this provision is to protect and promote the public health, safety and general welfare by requiring the\nlandscaping of parking lots. Landscaping will serve to reduce wind and air turbulence, erosion, heat and noise, the glare of\nautomobile lights, the level of carbon dioxide, the blighted appearance of parking areas. Landscaping will provide shade,\nconserve and stabilize property values, and facilitate the creation of attractive and harmonious community.\n2. After the effective date of this section, buffers and screening shall be required between all parking lots and abutting\nuses. A six- foot screen shall be provided between parking areas and adjacent properties which are residentially-zoned and other\nincompatible land uses. A three-foot screen shall be provided between the parking area and adjacent streets. The screen shall\nconsist of tight evergreen hedge and shall not be less than two feet in height at the time of planting.\n3. Vehicular use areas must be planted with at least two trees and one shrub for every 4,000 square feet of vehicular\nuse area, which includes parking spaces, aisles, driveways and loading areas. Trees shall be placed so that no parking space is\nmore than 63 feet from a tree. At least 75% of the required parking lot trees must be broadleaf canopy trees. Trees and shrubs\nmust be planted within 20 feet of the vehicular use area to count toward this provision; however, trees used for required\nscreening shall not count toward this provision. Nor shall any, if required, street trees count toward this provision.\n4. When a development contains 20 or more spaces, 50% of the trees and shrubs required above must be planted in\nislands or medians located within the parking lot. Tree islands shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking lot in order to\nprovide an even tree canopy throughout the lot. At a minimum, such tree islands shall consist of an area at least equal in size to\ntwo parking spaces side by side. Parking bays shall be broken up with landscaped islands or medians to avoid long monotonous\nrows of parking. Planting trees in groups is encouraged to increase the total amount of planting area for roots to\ngrow.\n(12) Access and circulation.\n(a) The type and arrangement of streets and driveways within the development shall be in compliance with the town\nThoroughfare Plan.\n(b) Principal vehicular access points to the development shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with minimum\nhazards to pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic. Accommodations for controlled turning movements into and out of t he\ndevelopment and improvement of the approach street shall be provided where existing or anticipated heavy traffic flows indicate\nneed.\n(c) Clear vision areas. To insure safe sight distances where streets intersect and where driveways interest streets, a\nminimum clear-vision area shall be provided at the corners of such intersections. No structure or planting that would impede\nvisibility shall be established in the clear vision area. Grading of land may be required where topography impedes the required\nclear vision area.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download\n234/322\n"}, {"page": "235", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(d) Access and circulation for all development shall comply with the most recently adopted version of the town street and\ntraffic standards policy.

The purpose of this section is to allow for the usage of density credits in association with the dedication of\nroad right-of-way. The Thoroughfare Plan of the Gaston Urban Area shows the location of existing and proposed thoroughfares in\nthe Dallas area. Per G.S. \u00a7 136-66.10, dedication of right-of way in conformance with the Thoroughfare Plan, may be required by\na local government. In association with such dedication, G.S. 136-66.10 also permits local elected bodies to grant density\ncredits. Such right-of-way dedication and the allowance of density credits is viewed as a means of fostering the orderly, timely,\nand cost-effective development and/or improvement of thoroughfares in the Dallas area.\n(B) Definitions.\n(1) For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different\nmeaning.\nDENSITY CREDIT. The potential for the improvement or subdivision of part or all of a parcel of real property as permitted\nunder the terms of this chapter.\nFUNCTIONAL DESIGN. A preliminary roadway design shall be approved by the Board of Aldermen on a topographic map\nat a scale no smaller than one inch equals 200 feet (1\" = 200') showing the horizontal width, centerline and typical cross-section\nfor a proposed roadway. Cross-sections shall show roadway and lane width, and right-of-way width, and may also show utility\neasements, and other roadway improvements that describe the final appearance of the road (i.e., sidewalks, tree plantings,\nbikeway facilities, etc.). Typical cross-sections should be based on NCDOT recommended street designs. All functional designs\nare maintained at the Metropolitan Planning Office facilities located in the Gastonia City Hall and are available for public\ninspection during normal business hours.\nTHOROUGHFARE PLAN. The version of the Thoroughfare Plan of the Gaston Urban Area most recently adopted by the\nBoard of Aldermen.\n(2) The following terms are to be used in computing and applying density credits:\nA1 = Entire area of land to be dedicated for thoroughfare right-of-way purposes if direct access to such thoroughfare by\nabutting lots from the tract in question is not permitted.\nA2 = If direct access from abutting lots (on the tract in question) to the thoroughfare is allowed, the difference between the\narea of land dedicated for right-of-way purposes.\nB = Area of tract prior to right-of-way dedication.\nC = A- (A1 of A2), (i.e., land in tract remaining after dedication is made).\nD = Minimum lot size requirement prior to application of density credit bonus.\nE = Minimum lot size after application of density credit bonus (A1 or A2/B X D).\nF = Maximum multi-family units per acre without density credit bonus.\n(C) Right-of-way dedication.\n(1) Per G.S. \u00a7 136-66.10, density credits may be granted by the Board of Aldermen whenever right-of-way dedication, in\naccordance with the Thoroughfare Plan, is required for a tract of land located within the planning jurisdiction of the town, and\nsuch tract is proposed for subdivision or use of land pursuant to a zoning permit.\n(2) Right-of-way dedication may be so required by the Board of Aldermen in situations where land subdivision is not\ninvolved, if the Board of Aldermen determines that:\n(a) Said dedication does not result in the deprivation of all reasonable use of the original tract; and\n(b) The dedication is reasonably related to the traffic generated by the proposed use of land, or the impact of the\ndedication is mitigated by other measures including the use of density credits, as herein prescribed, on contiguous land owned by\nthe sub-divider.\n(3) (a) If the full width of the thoroughfare for which land is to be dedicated is completely contained within the tract of land\nto be used or developed, up to 100% of the right-of-way needed to construct or enlarge the thoroughfare on that tract shall be\nprovided.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/downlo\n252/322\nCELL (1, 1): \n6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nCELL (1, 2): \nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\nCELL (2, 1): \n320,000 - 400,000 square feet 6 spaces\nCELL (2, 2): \n320,000 - 400,000 square feet 6 spaces\nCELL (3, 1): \nEach 100,00 square feet above\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \n400,000 square feet additional 1 space\nCELL (4, 2): \n400,000 square feet additional 1 space\n"}, {"page": "253", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(b) If a portion of such thoroughfare is located on the property proposed to be subdivided or developed, the corresponding\nproportion of land on that tract may be required to be dedicated.\n(4) Dedication of land, as provided herein, shall be offered to the public. Proof (in the form of an instrument having been\nrecorded in the Gaston County Deeds Office) of such dedication having been made shall be furnished to the Zoning Enforcement\nOfficer prior to the issuance of any zoning permit.\n(5) Any land so dedicated shall substantially be that as needed for the thoroughfare right-of-way in question as shown on the\nThoroughfare Plan.\n(D) Application of density credits.\n(1) The usage of density credits shall be applicable on a particular tract only if approved by the Board of Aldermen.\n(2) The amount of density credits granted by the Board of Aldermen shall be computed as follows:\n(a) If the tract(s) which abuts the proposed thoroughfare, or lots created from said tract which abut the thoroughfare, will\nbe able to directly access the thoroughfare, density credits will be computed only for that area of land dedicated (per the\nThoroughfare Plan). Irrespective of the above, the Board of Aldermen shall have the authority to issue density credits based on\nthe full right-of-way width, having determined that the proposed road location will significantly aid in the flow of traffic both in the\nimmediate vicinity and throughout the community.\n(b) If the tract(s) which abuts the proposed thoroughfare, or lots created from said tract which abut the thoroughfare, are\nnot permitted access or are otherwise unable to access the thoroughfare, density credits are to be calculated using the full-width\nof the right-of-way dedication area.\n(3) The result of the application of density credits shall be to allow for a level or intensity of development above that which\nwould normally be allowed in the underlying general zoning district and the creation of lots which may be smaller in area that\notherwise called for in the underlying zoning district.\n(E) Density credit calculations.\nThe following formulae shall be used in calculating the additional amount of development allowed using density credits:\n(1) Single-family (including lots containing individual manufactured homes) and two-family lots.\n(a) The density credit bonus is derived by dividing the area dedicated for thoroughfare right-of- way purposes (A1) or (A2)\nby the area of the entire tract and then multiplied by 100 [(A1 or A2)/B X 100]. The ensuing figure may be used on a percent-by-\npercent basis to reduce the minimum lot size by up to 25%. Irrespective of the use of density credits, all yard, height, parking, and\nsetback requirements as stated in this chapter are to be observed.\n(b) Additionally, all lots will either utilize a well and/or septic system or are located within the Watershed District must meet\nthe minimum lot area, maximum density, and other standards prescribed by the Gaston County Environmental Health Division or\nthe Gaston County Watershed Administrator. (Refer to Figure 1 for an illustrative example.)\nFigure 1: Subdivision\nProgram 100\nNote: Drawing not to scale\nNote: Drawing not to scale\nFACTS:\n1.

Minimum lot sizes can be reduced by up to11.5% for single- and two-family dwellings.\n4. All applicable yard requirements must be met on each lot.\nA subdivision is proposed for the above 20 acre lot. 100,000 square feet (or 11.5%) of the tract's area is taken up by the proposed\nthoroughfare right-of-way. Access from the subdivision lots to the thoroughfare shall not be permitted. Thus, the full density credit\n(100,000/871,200 or 0.115 is applicable.\nThe full density credit, 0.115, is below the maximum allowable (0.25). Thus, minimum lot sizes can be reduced by 11.5%.\n(2) Two-family developments and any other developments where density is measured on a units per acre basis.\n(a) The density credit bonus (A1 or A2/B) shall be multiplied by the maximum density level (F) in the underlying zoning\ndistrict. The resulting figure is then added to F and then multiplied by C, the remaining developable land in the tract once the\nright-of-way dedication has been made. In no case may the subsequent density level be raised by more than 25% over that level\nwhich is normally allowed in the underlying zoning district. Irrespective of the use of density credits, all yard, height, parking, and\nsetback requirements stated in this chapter are to be observed.\n(b) Additionally, all lots that will either utilize a well and/or septic system or are located within the Watershed District must\nmeet the minimum lot area, maximum density, and other standards prescribed by the Gaston County Environmental Health\nDivision or the Gaston County Watershed Administrator. (Refer to Figure 2 for an illustrative example.)\nFigure 2: Multi- Family\nProposed 100 Thoroughfure R/W\nNote: Drawing not to scale\nNote: Drawing not to scale\nFACTS:\n1. The tract has an area of 871,200 square feet (20 acres).\n2. The area of the thoroughfare right- of-way = 100, 000 square feet.\n3. Access onto the thoroughfare from the development is allowed.\n4. Maximum allowable density credit = 0.25.\n5. Normal maximum density = 10 units per acre.\nDENSITY CREDIT APPLICATION:\n1.\nOne-half of the right-of-way area, 50,000 square feet, can be used towards the density credit bonus.\n2. 50,000/871,200 = 0.057.\n3. 0.057 is less than 0.25.\n4. Minimum density of developable area (17.7 acres) can be increased by 5.7% (10 units/acre X 0.057= 10.57).\n5. 17.7X10.57 units/acre = 187 units.\n6. All applicable yard and parking requirements must be met.\nA multi-family development is proposed for the above 20 acre lot. 100,000 square feet (or 11.5%) of the tract's area is taken up by\nthe proposed thoroughfare right-of-way. Access from the tract up by the proposed thoroughfare is permitted. Thus, half of the\nright-of-way (50,000 square feet) is available for the density credit bonus. Thus, 50,000/871,200 = 0.057.\nNormal zoning allows a maximum density of 0 units/acre. The allowable maximum density is 10 X 1.057 = 10.57 units/acre with\nthe density credit. The amount of developable land (i.e., excluding the right-of-way) is 17.7 acres. Therefore, 17.7 X 10.57 = 187\nmulti-family units which can be built on the tract. The full density credit, 0.115, is below the maximum allowable (0.25). Thus,\nminimum lot sizes can be reduced by 11.5%.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download\n254/322\n"}, {"page": "255", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(3) Non-residential developments.\n(a) The area to be computed for the density credit shall first be determined (A1 or A2). Such area may be used to reduce\nthe number of required off-street parking spaces at a ratio of one off-street parking space reduction per 330 square feet of\navailable density credit area. In no case may the number of off-street parking spaces be reduced by greater than 10% over that\nwhich is normally required. All other applicable provisions of this chapter shall be observed.\n(b) Additionally, all lots that will either utilize a well and/or septic system or are located within the Watershed District must\nmeet the minimum lot area, maximum density, and other standards prescribed by the Gaston County Environmental Health\nDivision or the Gaston County Watershed Administrator (Refer to Figure 3 for an illustrative example.)\nFigure 3: Office Development\nProposed 100 Thoroughfare R/W\nNote: Drawing not to scale\nNote: Drawing not to scale\nFACTS:\n1.

The proposed commercial development normally requires 200 off-street parking spaced\n5. The density credit can be used to reduce the required number of off-street parking spaces by one space per 330 square\nfeet of available density credits.\nDENSITY CREDIT APPLICATION:\n1. One-half of the right-of-way area, 50,000 square feet, can be used towards the density credit bonus.\n2. 50,000/330 = 151.5.\n3. Parking spaces can be reduced by on greater than 20 spaces (10% of 200).\n4. To maximize the use of density credits, a large building could be developed on-site, so long as all applicable yard\nrequirements were meet.\nAn office development is proposed for the above 20 acre lot. 100,000 square feet (or 11.5%) of the tract's area is taken up by the\nproposed thoroughfare right-of-way. Access from the development to thoroughfare is permitted. Thus, half of the right-of-way\n(50,000 square feet) is available for the density credit bonus. Thus, 50,000/871,200 = 0.057.\nNormal zoning requires this building to have 200 off-street parking spaces. The available density credit, 50,000 square feet, can\nbe used to reduce the number of parking spaces by up to 20 (i.e., 10%). Use of the full available density credit will not be made.\nThe developer may wish to build a larger building to make full use of the density credits.\n(Ord. passed 5-11-1999)\n\u00a7 153.046 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS.\n(A) Purpose and intent.\n(1) Planned residential developments (PRD's) may consist of either single-family dwellings, duplexes, or multifamily\ndwellings, or a mixture of said housing types. A variety of dwelling types and physical arrangements may be permitted such as\nsingle-family detached houses, lotline houses, village houses, twin houses, duplexes, patio houses, atrium houses, townhouses,\nother cluster arrangements, or other multifamily arrangements.\n(2) The purpose for having planned residential developments is to promote variety, innovation, and flexibility in development\nby allowing certain variations in lot sizes, dwelling unit types and/or design requirements, the intended purpose of which is to:\n(a) Permit a creative approach to the development of residential land;\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/downloa\n255/322\n"}, {"page": "256", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(b) Provide for an efficient use of land;\n(c) Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural features;\n(d) Provide for recreational areas and open space; and\n(e) Provide an opportunity for new approaches to living environment and provide an environment of stable character\ncompatible with surrounding residential areas.\n(3) In keeping with the stated purpose of this section, PRD's are only allowed as conditional zoning districts. Furthermore,\nplanned developments are reviewed in terms of the overall density, quality of development, and building separation to ensure\npublic safety. Therefore, the lot and setback requirements for single-family residential development and non- residential\ndevelopment are waived for individual lots within the PRD. In addition, the minimum street frontage requirement in section 18-\n34(a), Lot Layout, in the City of Gastonia Subdivision Ordinance, may be reduced in PRD's. Minimum distances between multi-\nfamily, townhouse, and atrium developments are set forth in division (B)(19) below.\n(B) Project requirements. The following minimum requirements shall be applicable to any PRD.\n(1) Location, project size, density. (Shall only be used when it is in conjunction with a joint project with the City of Gastonia.)\n*\n\u00a7 153.047(C) provides for a schedule of density bonuses over and above these basic gross\ndensities where projects meet certain other requirements.\n**\nPer \u00a7 153.048(B)(1).\nAs calculated for the residential portions of the project only.\nt For Transitional infill developments (TID's), the size range may be between one acre and the\nminimum gross project area listed in the chart. For example, a TID in the R-1 district may be\nbetween 1.0 and 4.99 acres. Transitional infill developments (TIDs) within the Traditional design\n(TD) overlay district shall be between 15,000 square feet and three acres.\ntt For Transitional infill developments (TID's), there is a requirement for a minimum number of\ndwelling units in addition to the maximums stated in the chart. Notwithstanding the maximum\ngross densities listed, TIDs must have a minimum of five units. Accomplishing this minimum in\nR-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones may require conformity to the density bonus provisions in \u00a7\n153.047(C). Transitional infill developments (TIDs) within the Traditional design (TD) overlay\ndistrict must contain at least three dwelling units and shall have a maximum gross density of 18\ndwelling units per acre (not including any density bonus).\n(2) Dwelling unit types.

Common open space is only that land dedicated to the public or designated by the development\nplan for the use, benefit, and enjoyment of all residents of the planned development. Open space may be common area owned\nand maintained by a homeowners' association or open space dedicated to the public. The City of Gastonia will only except open\nspace when it is part of a larger public recreation system (such as land along a planned greenway route) and maintains sole\ndiscretion on property acceptance. To qualify as common open space, the land shall be usable for recreation purposes or provide\nvisual, aesthetic, or environmental amenities, and may not be occupied by streets, drives, parking areas, or structures (other than\nrecreational structures), with the exception of a sidewalk with at least a six-foot wide tree lawn.\n(a) 1.

Transitional infill developments (TIDs) within the traditional design (TD) overlay district having less than six dwelling\nunits are exempt from the common open space requirements.\n(c) Sidewalks constructed in conjunction with a six-foot wide tree lawn may be counted towards improved common open\nspace,\nhowever sidewalks and tree lawns may only account for up to 50% of the project's common improved open space\ncalculation. For example, if:\n1. 50,000 square feet of common improved open space is required, and\n2. 30,000 square feet is attributable to sidewalks with tree lawns, then\n3. 25,000 square feet may be applied toward improved common open space, and\n4. 5,000 square feet may be applied toward usable natural areas.\nTrees should be planted in a way that minimizes conflict with underground utilities.\n(d) Environmentally sensitive lands (land within a floodway or floodway fringe as determined by FEMA, land with slopes\ngreater than 25%, wetlands, and other critical ecological areas) shall not qualify as common open space. However, an exception\nmay be made when, based on staff evaluation, recreation areas and trails are provided within these lands in a manner that\ndoesn't overly impact sensitive areas.\n(e) All property owners in the PRD shall have access to the open space by means of a public or private street or an all-\nweather walkway in a publicly dedicated easement.\n(f) When improvements are made for recreational purposes, standard practices for long term durability and minimal\nmaintenance should be observed.\n(g) Open space shall be provided within each phase of the PRD in sufficient amounts to serve a substantial portion of the\nexpected population or occupancy of that phase.\n(h) If private walking or nature trails are proposed, said improved common open space shall be calculated as follows:\nIf any land within the calculated area is not unobstructed open space, said areas shall be\nsubtracted from this calculation. In addition, any area may only be used in determining the\nimproved common open space calculation.\n(i) For planned unit developments (PUDs), the percentage of open space shall be calculated based on the total acreage of\nresidential and institutional uses only. Contributing, improved open spaces within office and commercial areas can be counted\ntowards the total open space calculation.\n(15) Screening.

Off-street parking areas and all internal streets shall provide safe and\nconvenient access for emergency service and refuse collection vehicles and other service and delivery vehicles.\n(17) Points of ingress and egress. Any PRD containing 80 or more dwelling units shall have at least one point of ingress and\negress onto a major or minor thoroughfare as depicted on the most up-to-date version of the thoroughfare plan of the Gaston\nUrban Area.\n(18) Sidewalks. Sidewalks, constructed in accordance with all applicable city construction specifications, shall be placed on\nboth sides of major and minor thoroughfares. On streets other than thoroughfares, the construction of sidewalks on both sides of\nthe street is encouraged, however at a minimum sidewalks are required along one side of internal streets. Due to the size (i.e.,\nnumber of residences proposed) of the development and the associated internal road traffic network for the development, the\nPlanning Commission and/or City Council may require the placement of sidewalks in other situations where it is deemed to\nsupport the public's interest and general welfare.\n(19) Additional requirements. The following additional requirements apply to multifamily, townhouse or atrium developments\nwithin a PRD:\n(a) The arrangement of buildings shall not create long alleyways between the rears of residential buildings on the site.\n(b) The front entrance to any residential building shall not directly face the rear of any other residential building unless the\ntwo buildings are located at least 200 feet apart and within said 200 feet lies an equivalent level 1-A or higher screen; if the two\nbuildings are located between 100 to 200 feet apart, an equivalent level 2 or higher screen shall be provided. In no instance shall\nthe rears of any two residential buildings be allowed less than 100 feet apart.\n(c) No exterior wall of a building shall run unarticulated for a horizontal distance of more than 40 feet.\n(d) A minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between one story buildings. An additional five feet of separation shall be\nadded for each additional story. A multiple story building with lower end units shall be considered a multiple story building. In\nTIDs, a minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between all attached structures, regardless of height.\n(e) All building wall faces of greater than 200 square feet in area shall have at least six square feet of window area per 200\nsquare feet of total wall area. However, this requirement shall not apply to walls facing alleyways.\n(20) Multi-phased projects. Each phase of a multi-phased project shall be able to stand as an independent project. As used\nin this section, the term PHASE shall refer to that portion of the project for which the applicant requests special use permit. Only\nas part of a multi-phased project shall the density of residential development in a completed phase of the project area exceed the\nmaximum density approved for the project. Two examples of this are as follows:\n(a) A 100 unit complex is proposed on a site containing ten acres. The maximum density allowed is ten units per acre. The\ndeveloper proposes to develop the project in four phases, each phase containing 25 units. The maximum density allowed in each\nphase shall be ten units per acre.\n(b) A 60 unit development is proposed to be developed in three phases. The maximum allowable density for the project is\nten units per acre. Phase one is developed at a density of five units per acre. Phase two may be developed at a maximum\ndensity of 15 units per acre. In this manner, the cumulative density of the project is not greater than the maximum allowed of ten\nunits per acre. In no instance may the cumulative density at any time exceed ten units per acre.\n(21) Lot line houses. Lot line houses may be built without one required side yard provided any portion of a wall containing\nwindows, doors, or other openings shall not be closer than five feet to the zero lot line. Furthermore, any window air-conditioning\nunit, utility meters of any sort, through-the-wall appliance vents, and HVAC equipment shall be set back at least five feet from the\nzero lot line. Code approved translucent glass (architectural glass block for example) is allowed up to the zero lot line. Gutters\nand downspouts shall be installed so that water is not channeled or directed beyond the zero lot line. Fences or walls along the\nzero lot line side shall be solid and at least six feet in height. Maintenance agreements applicable to structures along property\nlines shall be provided.\n(C) Density bonus. A density bonus of up to 31% over the basic density normally allowed may be approved by the Planning\nCommission or City Council when granting the special use permit or conditional rezoning. Such density bonus must be based\nupon the amount of common open space greater than that required by this section. The common open space calculation is\nderived from the gross project acreage and the acreage of common open space provided which meets the requirements of this\nsection. For each one percent increase in the amount of common open space and improved common open space provided, the\nnumber of dwelling units allowed increases by .15. The table below indicates the density bonus allowed in an R-1/PRD.\nExample for R-1/PRD\nhhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n260/322\n"}, {"page": "261", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\nMinimum % of Site\nMinimu m % of Site\nMaximu m Allowabl\n(Gross Project Area)\nMaximu m Gross\n(Gross Project Area)\ne Density Bonus (%\nto be Common Open\nto be Improved\nDensity (Dwelli ng\nUnits per Acre)\nIncrease in Units per\nCommon Open\nSpace\nAcre)\nSpace\nExample for R-1/PRD\nApplication for the density bonus must accompany the preliminary site plan when the plan is\nsubmitted for approval\n(D) Transitional infill developments (TIDs). A transitional infill development (TID) is a type of PRD characterized by smaller\nproject areas and higher density, innovative development. The project size of any PRD-TID shall be between one acre and the\nminimum size established for regular PRDs, provided however, TIDs within the traditional design (TD) overlay district shall be\nbetween 15,000 square feet and the minimum size established for regular PRDs. Any such development must contain at least\nfive dwelling units (three dwelling units in the Traditional design (TD) overlay district), regardless of project size. A TID may be\nestablished only on parcels that meet all of the following criteria:\n(1) Follow the procedures for establishing a PRD, as outlined in this section; and\n(2) Be either:\n(a) Adjacent to, or across a street from, a non-residential zoning district; or\n(b) Have frontage on/direct access to a major or minor thoroughfare; or\n(c) Be located within the traditional design (TD) district.\n(Ord. passed 7-11-2005; Am.

Ord. passed )\n\u00a7 153.048 TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENTS.\nA traditional neighborhood development (TND) is a type of planned unit development (PUD); provided however, if it contains\nonly residential land uses (and other nonresidential uses typically allowed by right in the applicable residential district) it may be\ndeemed a type of planned residential development (PRD). Most TND's will require a rezoning to the PUD-CZ district. A TND that\ncan meet the requirements for PRD within the applicable zoning district may be approved as a PRD by the special use permit\nprocess (no rezoning required). All other TND's will require rezoning to the PUD-CZ district.\nA traditional neighborhood development is a development that substantially meets the guiding principles of traditional\nneighborhood development design as set forth in this section.\n(A)\nPurpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to set forth guiding principles for traditional neighborhood\ndevelopment design and to allow relief to some of the PRD/PUD standards in \u00a7\u00a7 153.047 and 153.048 for TND's when such\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n263/322\n"}, {"page": "264", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\ndevelopments are found to substantially meet the guiding principles of this section.\n(B) Guiding principles. For organizational purposes, the guiding principles have been divided into six categories; however,\nmost principles relate to multiple categories. A TND must substantially meet these principles. Where the development application\ndoes not meet a principle, the applicant shall submit justification therefor, unless the principle is described as optional. The\nguiding principles are as follows:\n(1) The principles of the public realm.\n(a) The central element of traditional neighborhood design is the emphasis and weight given to the public realm (the\nstreets and plazas, and the public open spaces such as parks, playgrounds, greens, and natural areas, together with semi-public\nspaces which frame the public realm and provide transition between public and entirely private spaces).\n(b) TND's feature well-designed public spaces, special emphasis on public and cultural buildings, and special design\ntreatment for vista terminations.\n(c) A sense of enclosure is maintained along the public street through an appropriate ratio between the height of building\nfronts and the distance between buildings on opposite sides of the street. Where street frontage consists of single story buildings\nor open space, street trees can be a substitute for front building walls to maintain this sense of enclosure.\n(d) Non-residential buildings are set at or very near the sidewalk. In most situations, the same is true for attached housing.\nSingle homes have relatively shallow setbacks, typically one-fourth to one-third the lot width. Encroachments are allowed for\nporches, steps, bay windows, and balconies.\n(e) The public realm is appropriately landscaped. Unless good landscape design would otherwise dictate, each street is\nprovided with an orderly regimen of street trees of substantial nursery stock, which will grow quickly to provide a street canopy.\nPlanting strips wide enough to accommodate street trees typically separate sidewalks from street roadways, see division (B)(2)(f).\n(f) Single-family home lots in TND's are typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions. A substantial\namount of land area savings from reduced lot sizes is dedicated toward common areas.\n(g) Narrower lots necessitate alternative treatment of certain fixtures that can diminish the aesthetic quality of the public\nrealm. A system of rear access lanes (alleys) can provide garage access at the rear of the lot. This is especially preferred for lots\nless than 50 feet in width. When built to a 16-foot standard with a 24-foot right-of-way, the alley can also serve as an appropriate\nlocation for electric, gas, cable tv, and telephone equipment as well as access for garbage pickup and mail delivery. On lots at\nleast 50 feet wide, alternate, less preferred methods of garage access include (in descending order of preference):\n1. Front driveway accessing a garage behind the house or near the back of the lot;\n2. Turning the garage so that it does not face the front (provided the garage is set behind the front building line);\n3. Setting the garage at least 20 feet behind the front of the house; or\n4. Providing special architectural treatment to the house to visually de-emphasize a garage at the front.\nWhere alleys are not available, other measures are taken to hide unsightly utility equipment; however, fire hydrants are always\nlocated on the fronting street, ideally situated on planting strip bulb-outs at intersections.\n(h) TND's are designed so that there are linkages between the private realm and the public realm while protecting private\nspaces. Single homes have front porches large enough for sitting (six to eight feet minimum depth), and attached dwellings\ntypically have sitting porches or front stoops. Guidelines to allow for low front picket fences are often provided. Always for single\nhomes served by alleys, and where feasible and designed appropriately for town homes, private spaces are protected at the rear\nusing privacy devices according to the development guidelines. The bottom floor of any dwelling whose sidewalk facing wall is\nwithin five feet of such sidewalk should be elevated sufficiently above the sidewalk to provide additional privacy inside the\ndwelling.\n(i) TND's are designed to feature vista terminations at multiple locations. Vistas can terminate to important buildings, parks\nand greens, civic features in the town center, a carefully sited dwelling, a curve in the road, natural green edge, distant objects\nand scenery, and other features as appropriate. Entry into the community usually uses an important vista termination to provide a\nsense of place arrival.\n(j) Utility wiring is underground and decorative street lighting fixtures are typically provided. Exceptions are provided for\nindustrial areas.\n(2) The principles of the transportation system.\n(a) TND's always have a connecting web of streets, typically provided by a grid or modified grid street pattern. The street\nsystem is organized in a comprehensible network hierarchy that forms an orderly discernable neighborhood or town structure.\n(b) Cul-de-sacs are avoided unless natural site or site boundary conditions require them. In such situations, special street\ndesign features such as eyebrows and cul-de-sac loops are encouraged instead of standard ball-end cul-de-sacs.\n(c) Curved as well as straight streets are allowed; however, each must contribute to the connecting web. Where possible,\ncurved streets maintain the same cardinal orientation. Long blocks are to be avoided with an average block being no more than\n600 feet in length or 1,800 feet in perimeter.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n264/322\n"}, {"page": "265", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(d) While the \"sense of enclosure\" described in division (B)(1)(c) above will help to reduce traffic speeds, additional design\nmeasures will be needed to slow traffic. Examples of such measures include such features as \"bulbing out\" the curb line at\nintersections, traffic circles, streets no wider than necessary to provide adequate access, design for and encouragement of on-\nstreet parking, and safe but unconventional street geometrics. The internal streets should be designed to feel safe driving at a\nspeed no more than 25 miles per hour.\n(e) Typical street widths include: 34 - 38 feet for a main street with marked parking on both sides; 32 - 34 feet for lesser\nstreets with marked parking on both sides); 27 - 29 feet for through streets with marked parking on one side; 24 - 26 feet for\nstandard streets with unmarked parking allowed to stagger from side to side; 20--24 feet for low density local streets with\nunmarked parking on one side; 20 feet for one-way streets with parking on one side; and 16 feet for public residential alleys\n(private alleys may be allowed as narrow as 12 feet) with commercial alleys typically being 24 feet. Where possible, streets are\nencouraged to narrow to 22 - 24 feet at intersections and at mid-block cross walks. Curve radii at intersections are ten feet to 20\nfeet, depending on street function. Standard vertical curb is preferred, and it is required on all residential streets without\ndriveways (auto access is provided via a rear alley) and all commercial streets.\n(f) TND's are always walkable communities in the fullest sense. They typically contain sidewalks on both sides of the street\nand, in addition, may contain a network of off-road walking and bike trails. Pedestrian facilities always meet the three standards of\nsafety, comfort and interest. Sidewalks are well separated from the roadway with planting strips that are planted with indigenous,\nmostly deciduous shade trees (on commercial streets sidewalks may extend to the curb with street trees planted in grates or\nother sufficiently sized planting space). Planting strips should be six feet to ten feet wide (eight feet is recommended), but may be\nreduced to four feet in situations that are both unusual and difficult. Sidewalks are recommended five feet in width on residential\nstreets, wider on commercial streets.\n(g) TND's always have multiple points of ingress and egress from collector and major roads. The street system should also\nflow seamlessly to adjoining neighborhoods either existing or future.\n(h) TND's are never gated.\n(i) Parking lots should not front along a street. On-street parking is provided throughout the development, and particularly\nso on streets with commercial buildings and attached housing. Where additional parking is needed, it is provided behind buildings\nin the interior of the block. The calculation of parking needs for nonresidential uses should always take into consideration\navailable on-street parking and the expected walkable patronage. Parking lots shall include shade trees and no space in a\nparking lot shall be further than 60 feet from the trunk of a shade tree. Each shade tree shall be planted in a planting area sized\nand shaped to enable healthy growth, a minimum of 200 square feet. Pedestrian access from interior block parking area is best\nprovided via a mid-block passageway to the street front. This passageway can also be used for other activities such as front\nentrances for small shops, access to second floor apartments, outdoor dining, outdoor vendors and outdoor display of plants,\nflowers and other appropriate items for sale.\n(j) When located on a public transit route a dry, inviting waiting place is provided at the neighborhood center. Where not\nlocated on a transit route, the TND should be given consideration for future route expansions when ridership can be expected.\n(3) The principles of mixed use.\n(a) TND's almost always contain a mixture of uses and dwelling types. Exceptions may be made for TND's of less than 25\nacres and/or one that is within safe, easy walking distance to retail and other neighborhood services.\n(b) TND's always feature a mixture of residential types. While a mix of single homes and at least one type of attached\nhousing is required in the development, an appropriate and carefully designed blending of single and attached housing within the\ndevelopment is encouraged.\n(c) TND's offer housing at a variety of affordability levels. Allowing garage apartments and \"granny flats\" at the rear of\nsingle home lots, in accordance with the development's private guidelines (whether rented or not) is encouraged. These\ninnovative (but historically traditional) housing forms help to accommodate family situations and promote income diversity within\nthe TND.\n(d) Live-work units (shop or office at the street level and residence at the second level), apartments over businesses, and\ncovenant provisions for zero-impact customary home occupations are encouraged.\n(e) In traditional communities the denser housing and live-work units are typically located closer to the town center with a\ntransition outward to less dense housing such as single homes. This principle should not be construed to discourage the careful\nblending of housing types as this transition occurs.\n(f) Schools and churches are encouraged within the TND as is the provision of pedestrian and bicycle routes to connect to\nsuch facilities inside or outside the TND. It is, however, recognized that school location will, in most cases, not be possible unless\nthe public school system considers smaller site standards.\n(g) Where buildings are on both sides of the street, similar building types should face each other when possible. Single\nhouse, townhouse, live-work unit, apartment building and store building are examples of building types.\n(h) TND's are expected to provide some on-site and/or adjacent to site employment opportunities. This can include\nemployment in the services and stores within the TND, live-work units (the owners dwelling over his/her shop or office), or larger\nemployment centers such as office buildings and light industry. Industry should be located along a major road at the outer edge of\nthe TND, where direct major road access is provided for trucks and workers who live elsewhere. Also, appropriate transition (and\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n265/322\n"}, {"page": "266", "text": "6/26/23, AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\npedestrian access) must be designed between the industry and the neighborhood. Industrial buildings and their sites should\ninclude features sympathetic to traditional design principles, along with landscaped and natural areas used to create transition to\nthe rest of the TND.\n(4) The architectural principles.\n(a) The architecture should respond to the surrounding fabric of buildings and spaces and to local traditions. The principle\nthat structures should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings (within the TND) transcends the issue of style.\n(b) Each building always exhibits principles of human and pedestrian scale and contributes appropriately to the pedestrian\nlife of the street.\n(c) Architecture within the development should reflect styles that are complimentary of each other. Private development\ncontrols assure a variety styles or sub-styles which serve to compliment each other while providing for overall consistency and\nreflection of the principles of traditional neighborhood design.\n(d) Affordability variations between housing types and choices do not translate into meaningful inferior architectural\ntreatment of lower cost housing choices, as such housing relates to the public realm.\n(e) Commercial buildings typically take on a \"shop front\" type appearance, joined by common walls, set with the front and\nentrance at the sidewalk along the street, and are typically two or more stories high (other uses such as residential and offices\nmay occupy upper floors). Commercial buildings should not face intersecting streets with blank walls.\n(f) Residential buildings, other than bungalows and patio homes, should be at least two stories tall.\n(g) Except to more accurately portray pre-1940 architectural styles, buildings should employ relatively flat fronts and\nsimple roofs. (Note: This principle shall not be construed to require Pre-1940 architectural styles). Building articulations and\nsetback encroachments for porches, stoops, steps, bay windows, balconies and other such features that form the transition\nbetween the public and private realms are encouraged.\n(h) Corner-lot homes should face their front door to the larger street (unless said street is a thoroughfare), except for an\nend-unit townhouse or row house, which may turn the corner with its front (unless the side street is an alley). Fronting a\ntownhouse on both the primary street and the intersecting street with two doors and/or wrap-around porch is encouraged.\n(5) The principles of the neighborhood center.\n(a) TND's have at least one defined center. Neighborhood centers typically feature uses such as shops and services, live-\nwork units, attached dwellings, apartments over businesses, a formal open space such as a village square or green, and\npublic/civic buildings (church, community building/center, and post office are examples).\n(b) Automobile oriented uses are typically not found in a neighborhood center and drive-thru facilities are strongly\ndiscouraged; an exception may be made for a bank abutting a thoroughfare.\n(c) A public gathering space such as a plaza, green or square is almost always present along with one or more focal\nfeatures in or near this public space such as a clock tower, fountain, monument, bandstand and/or public art which serve to\nterminate vistas and define the community.\n(d) The TND center is ideally located near the geographic center of the development; however, it may also identify itself\njointly with a thoroughfare bordering the TND (and therefore, be located near this major road or be linked to this road with an\nentrance street) in order that businesses within the center may more easily attract patrons from outside the development. This\ncan serve to improve chances for economic success of the TND center. Ideally, the neighborhood center is no farther than one-\nquarter mile radius of most dwellings; however, a neighborhood center that is within 2,400 feet of 80% of the dwellings in the TND\nis acceptable in order to allow the center to identify itself jointly with an adjoining thoroughfare.\n(e) Development form in the center typically reflects the traditional \"main street\" or \"town square\" vernacular of the region\nas described in division (B)(4)(e) above and parking is provided in accordance with division (B)(2)(c) above.\n(f) Other civic uses are encouraged, including schools and day care centers; however, such uses should take on design\nfeatures and lot sizes sympathetic to traditional principles and a walkable community. Office employment may occur at the TND\ncenter or along major roads adjoining the TND. Light industrial employment, if present, is more appropriately located along a\nmajor road boundary in accordance with division (B)(3)(c) above.\n(g) At least one site should be reserved at or near the neighborhood center, for an important community or civic building\nsuch as a community center, church, school, amenity center (club house and recreation facility) or community hall. The site\nshould be prominent and special.\n(6) The principles of open space and natural site characteristics.\n(a) A substantial amount of land savings generated by a more compact development form is converted to common open\nspaces.\n(b) TND's always have formal public open spaces such as greens, village squares, parks and playgrounds. They may also\nhave substantial amounts of natural or semi-natural open spaces that typically feature more informal amenities such as\nwalking/bicycling trails and picnic areas.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download\n266/322\n"}, {"page": "267", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(c) There is always a significant civic space such as a town square, green, commons, or plaza at the neighborhood center.\n(d) Small parks are distributed throughout the development, usually within 1,000 feet of any dwelling.\n(e) Pre-existing or natural water features should be retained and made a community asset.\n(f) The site should be designed in a manner that preserves specimen trees and significant groups of mature deciduous\ntrees. Major tree stands should be incorporated into public open spaces, where possible.\n(g) The neighborhood design should adapt itself, as much as possible, to the existing topography to minimize the amount\nof grading necessary to achieve a viable street network.\n(h) Parks, plazas, and commons should be equipped with proper furnishings and shade trees to encourage outdoor sitting,\nhuman interaction and people watching; while some common areas should be grassed and left open (except for street trees) to\nencourage the types of leisure/recreational activities that require open areas.\n(C) Relief (or establishment of greater standards) to certain PRD/PUD requirements. In order that TND's may meet the\nprinciples set forth in this section the following provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 153.047 and 153.048 are hereby modified for developments which\nare found to substantially meet the guiding principles of TND.\n(1) \u00a7 153.047(B)(4), (5) and (6), for TND's minimum setbacks, shall be the same as for transitional infill developments\n(TIDs). Allowed encroachments into rear setbacks along the project boundary include accessory buildings (including accessory\ndwellings) up to ten feet (20 feet for two stories) from project boundary; utility equipment; alleys up to eight feet provided an\nevergreen tree planting strip is provided if the alley is not used by development outside the project boundary; fences and walls;\nand uses allowed to encroach according to section 17-132. Where commercial uses within the TND adjoin single family areas\noutside the TND, the planning commission may require additional setbacks, not to exceeding a cumulative total of 50 feet.\n(2) \u00a7 153.047(B)(11), TND's shall meet the same requirement as a TID. Parking spaces inside garages are counted.\n(3) \u00a7 153.047(B)(13), except for rear access alleys, driveways and parking drives/aisles, private streets are not allowed in\nTND's.\n(4) \u00a7 153.047(B)(15), minimum screening requirements, do not apply to TND's; provided, however, the planning commission\nmay require screening in any situation along the boundary of a TND or inside a TND as a condition for approval wherever it\ndeems appropriate for the protection of adjoining properties or to establish necessary transition.

It is recognized that\ncertain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of special conditions.\n(B) The Conditional Zoning (CZ) District process allows for the establishment of certain uses that, because of their nature or\nscale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole. The development of these uses cannot\nbe predetermined or controlled by general district standards. In order to accommodate these uses, this Section establishes the\nconditional zoning process. The process for approval of a Conditional Zoning District is explained in \u00a7 153.072.\n(C) The rezoning of any parcel of land to a CZ district shall be a voluntary process initiated by the property owner or his\nauthorized agent. Any area rezoned to a conditional district shall be in strict compliance with the goals, objectives and\nimplementation strategies of the Town of Dallas' most current Future Land Use Plan and all other plans and regulations officially\nadopted by the Town of Dallas Board of Alderman. The review process established in this Section provides for the\naccommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a Conditional Zoning District, subject to specific conditions\n(which may exceed those that would otherwise be required for the use in question), which ensure compatibility of the use with the\nenjoyment of neighboring properties and in accordance with the general plans of development of the town. A conditional zoning\ndistrict is not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal.\n(Ord. passed 12-8-1985; Am. Ord. passed 1-14-2020; Am.

The \"conditional zoning\" district (CZ) approval process is established to address those situations when a\nparticular use may be acceptable but the general zoning districts which would allow that use would not be acceptable. Such\nzones may be approved or changed only by the Planning Board or Board of Alderman in accordance with the regulations\ncontained herein. The review process established herein provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of\nproperty into a \"conditional\" district.\n(1) Rezoning of property to any conditional district is a voluntary procedure on the part of the property owner.\n(2) Unlike requests for rezoning to a general zoning district, an application for a conditional zoning may be filed only by the\nowner of the property in question or the owner's authorized agent.\n(B) Application process.\n(1) Petitioning for a conditional zoning district is a voluntary procedure and can be initiated only by the owner(s) of the\nproperty(ies) in question or by his/her authorized agent. No conditional zoning district may be established until an application has\nbeen submitted and the Board of Alderman has approved such application. The Administrator shall schedule a meeting with\nthe\napplicant, prior to any public information meeting (PIM) being advertised and/or held to review the conditional rezoning\napplication.\n(2) Furthermore, no application shall be considered complete unless it is accompanied by all items required by this section\nand a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule approved by the governing board for the submittal of an application for rezoning to a\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/downlos\n273/322\n"}, {"page": "274", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\nconditional district. Said fee shall be waived for any application submitted by any official or agency acting on behalf of the Town of\nDallas, Gaston County or the State of North Carolina.\n(3) The Administrator may require the petitioner to submit more than one copy of the conditional rezoning application in\norder to have enough copies available to circulate to other government agencies for review and comment. When dealing with the\nconditional zoning district process, it may be desirable to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and\nits relationship to the surrounding area. Therefore, the Planning Board or Board of Alderman may request additional information\nas they deem necessary.\n(C) Public involvement meeting.\n(1) Before a legislative hearing may be held on a petition for a conditional zoning district, the petitioner must file with the\nplanning department a written report of at least one community meeting held by the petitioner.\n(2) Written notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property owners and organizations entitled to notice as provided by\n\u00a7 153.124.\n(3) The report shall include among other things, a listing of those persons and organizations contacted about the meeting\nand the manner and date of contact, the date, time and location of the meeting, and a description of any changes to the\nconditional rezoning petition made by petitioner as a result of the meeting. In the event the petitioner has not held at least one\nmeeting pursuant to this subsection, the petitioner shall file a report documenting efforts that were made to arrange such a\nmeeting and stating the reasons such a meeting was not held. The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this\nsection shall be considered by the Planning Board and/or the Board of Alderman but shall not be subject to judicial review.\n(D) Submittal to Zoning Administrator. Before any property is rezoned to a (CZ) conditional district, the application must be\nreviewed by the Planning Board, and a legislative hearing first must be held by the Board of Alderman. Upon submission of a\ncompleted application, the applicant will be informed of the dates of the meetings and legislative hearing. The Planning Board\nreview shall be held first and shall take place no sooner than five weeks after the complete application has been submitted to the\nzoning administrator. Notification of the legislative hearings shall be made as provided by \u00a7 153.124.\n(E) Planning Board review. Once the Planning Board review has been concluded, the Planning Board shall have up to 45 days\nto render a recommendation on the conditional rezoning. Any recommendation shall be accompanied by a statement describing\nwhether the action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable and\nexplaining why the Planning Board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. Once a\nrecommendation is received by the Planning Board, the Administrator will coordinate with the applicant to set a date for the\nlegislative hearing to be held at a Board of Alderman meeting, to be followed by a decision.\n(F) Board of Alderman action. Any legislative hearing held by the Board of Alderman pertaining to the Conditional Zoning must\nbe set within 60 days of the date of recommendation. The Board of Alderman may open and continue this hearing and take action\nat a later date. The Board of Alderman will be apprised of the Planning Board's previous actions on the matter at hand. Any\ndecision on a Conditional Zoning shall be accompanied by a statement describing whether the action is consistent with an\nadopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable and explaining why the Board of Alderman\nconsiders the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest.\n(G) Conditions to approval of petition. Conditional Zoning shall be legislative in nature. In approving a petition for the\nreclassification of a piece of property to a conditional district, the Board of Alderman may agree to reasonable and appropriate\nconditions attached to approval of the petition. Such conditions shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the\ndevelopment and use of the site to Town Ordinances and an officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those that\naddress the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. The petitioner will have a\nreasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the governing\nboard. In no instance shall any of these conditions be less restrictive than any requirements that would otherwise pertain to that\nparticular development if it were located in a general zoning district. The applicant must provide written consent to the mutually\nagreed upon conditions. Such conditions may exceed any performance criteria or minimum requirements listed elsewhere in this\nchapter that pertain to that development. Statements that:\n(1) Analyze whether the rezoning is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan;\n(2) Other matters that the town deems appropriate; and\n(3) Why it considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest shall be prepared and accompany each final\ndecision relative to the conditional rezoning request.\n(H) Payment in lieu of open space dedication.\n(1) If open space within a development is physically impractical due to unusual topographic conditions then the Board of\nAlderman may, at its discretion, accept either an equitable amount of land in another location, or a fee paid to the town in lieu of\ndedication, through conditional zoning.\n(2) The following formula shall be used to determine the fee:\n(Assessed Value of On-Site Property) X ((Yearly Adjusted Inflation Rate) (# of Years since Last\nRevaluation) +1) = Payment in Lieu of Open Space Dedication Fee\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n274/322\n"}, {"page": "275", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(a) Assessed value of on-site property equals the value of the required amount of land to be dedicated as a percentage of\nthe assessed valuation of the site prior to subdivision. (i.e. If the total acreage is 100 and the total assessed value equals\n$500,000 and the required open space dedication is 15 acres, then the Assessed Value of the Open Space Dedication would be\n15% of $500,000 or $75,000.\n(b) Yearly adjusted inflation rate is based upon prevailing inflation rates as reported annually in the Wall Street Journal or\nother reliable financial reporting medium. (i.e. 3%)\n(c) Number of years since last revaluation is the total number of years since the last revaluation was conducted by the taxing\nauthority.\nExample:\nAssessed Valuation: $75,000\nInflation Rate: 3%\nYrs Since Last Revaluation: 6\nCost of Off-Site Open Space= $88,500\n(75,000) X ((0.3x6)+1) = $88,500\n(2) Payments in lieu of dedication shall be approved as part of the schematic. Any disagreement in the amount of required\npayment shall be resolved by conducting a professional appraisal of the fair market value of the property. The professional\nappraiser shall be mutually agreed upon by the town or appointed by the town should an agreement not be reached. All\npayments made in lieu of dedication shall be made at the time of construction document approval. Failure to submit the required\nfee along with such applications will delay approval of such submissions until payment is rendered. All funds received for\npayment in lieu of dedication shall be used for the acquisition, development, or redevelopment of public open space within the\nsame general area of the new development; within the town.\n(I) Effect of approval; zoning map designation. If a petition for a conditional district is approved, the district that is established\nand all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property as an amendment to the zoning\nmap. Subsequent development on the property in question shall be in accordance to the standards for the approved conditional\ndistrict, the site plan, and any conditions attached to the approval. The applicant shall be responsible for all expenses involved in\nthe dedication of rights-of-way when such dedication is a condition of the rezoning. Following the approval of the petition for\na\nconditional zoning district, the subject property shall be identified on the Zoning Map by the appropriate district designation. The\nfuture land use map shall be deemed amended when an inconsistent rezoning is approved by the Board of Aldermen.\n(J) Binding effect.\n(1) The Administrator may approve minor changes in the detail of the approved application. A \"minor change\" to the\napproved conditional use permit shall be deemed to be a change which:\n(a) Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property;\n(b) Will not increase the gross floor area of any nonresidential use by the smaller of ten 10% or 10,000 square feet (Note:\nSuch limitations shall be cumulative and shall be based on the gross floor area of the conditional use permit as originally\napproved);\n(c) Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio below the minimum number of parking spaces required by this chapter or\nreduce the yards provided at the periphery of the site, by the lesser of ten feet or 10% of the current existing yard measurement;\n(d) Will not increase the height of any structure to the extent that additional usable floor space could be added;\n(e) Will not result in an increase in the number of dwelling units constructed;\n(f) Will not alter the uses permitted.\n(2) Further changes to the development may be made only by the Planning Board or Board of Alderman in accordance with\nthis chapter.\n(3) No certificate of occupancy for a use listed in a conditional district shall be issued for any building or land use on a piece\nof property unless the building is constructed or used, or the land is developed or used, in conformity with the conditions\napproved. In the event that only a segment of a proposed development has been approved, the certificate of occupancy shall be\nissued only for that portion of the development constructed or used as approved.\n(K) Change in CD Zoning. Once a petition for rezoning to a conditional district has been approved by the Board of Alderman,\nany request to materially change (i.e., any change other than a \"minor change\" as defined in \u00a7 153.072(I)) the parallel conditional\ndistrict shall be considered a new zoning change request. All procedures pertinent to new conditional rezoning requests as\noutlined in this chapter shall be followed.\n(L) Petition resubmission.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download\n275/322\n"}, {"page": "276", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(1) If a request for conditional zoning is denied, a similar application for the same property or any portion thereof shall not be\nfiled until the expiration of a 12-month period from the date of denial. This waiting period shall not be applicable where the\napplication for a conditional zoning is determined by the Administrator to be substantially different from (i.e., not similar to) the\noriginal application.\n(2) Notwithstanding, the Administrator may allow resubmission of a similar application within said 12-month period if it\ndetermines that since the date of action on the prior petition:\n(a) There has been a significant change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent piece of property; or\n(b) The governing board has adopted a plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the\nproposed conditional rezoning should be developed; or\n(c) Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line, or other such facilities has occurred to serve the property\nand can accommodate comfortably the intensity of development allowed under the proposed classification; or\n(4) There has been some other extraordinary change in conditions or circumstances, outside the control of the petitioner,\nwhich justifies waiver of the 12-month restriction on a new petition; this, however, shall not include a change in the ownership of\nthe subject property.\n(L) Petition withdrawal. An applicant who has submitted a complete application for a conditional rezoning may withdraw the\napplication prior to a final decision being rendered.\n(1) If a petition is withdrawn once a legislative hearing has been advertised (via paper, mail, or on-premises sign), a similar\npetition submitted by that property owner (or his agent) shall not be accepted by the Administrator within 180 days of the date of\nwithdrawal. (Note: The purpose of this is to allow petitions to be withdrawn without penalty prior to the posting of any legislative\nhearing notices or submittal of such notice to the newspaper of general circulation).\n(2) If said petition is otherwise withdrawn within two business days of a public hearing where a final decision may have been\notherwise rendered, a similar petition submitted by that property owner/or his agent shall not be accepted by the Administrator\nwithin one year of the date of withdrawal.\n(M) Appeals. An appeal to the decision of the Board of Alderman shall be filed with the Clerk of Superior Court in the nature of\ncertiorari in accordance with G.S 160D-1402 within 30 days after the Board of Alderman's decision.\n(Ord. passed 12-8- 1985; Am. Ord. passed 1-14-2020; Am. Ord. passed )\n\u00a7 153.073 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.\nPursuant to Chapter 160D, Article 10 of the North Carolina General Statutes development agreement may, by ordinance, be\nincorporated, in whole or in part, into any development regulation adopted by the local government. A development agreement\nmay be considered concurrently with a zoning map or text amendment affecting the property and development subject to the\ndevelopment agreement. A development agreement may be concurrently considered with and incorporated by reference with a\nsketch plan or preliminary plat required under a subdivision regulation or a site plan or other development approval required\nunder a zoning regulation. If incorporated into a conditional district, the provisions of the development agreement shall be treated\nas a development regulation in the event of the developer's bankruptcy.

There are many uses identified in Appendix C that are \"uses by right\" and that are allowed \"by right\" in each\ngeneral zoning district subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard and off-street parking and loading requirements. In\naddition to these uses, there are some uses in these districts that are \"special uses\" are and subject to the issuance of a special\nuse permit. The purpose of having special uses is to ensure that these uses are compatible with surrounding development and\nare in keeping with the purposes of the general zoning district in which they are located. There may be some uses that prior to\nadoption of this subchapter were allowed as \"uses by right\" but now are allowed subject to a special use permit SUP. For these\nuses, any expansion or modification to the uses would be subject to the issuance of a special use permit.\n(B) Process.\n(1) A pre-application meeting between the applicant and the Administrator shall be required in order to familiarize the\napplicant of the procedure for securing approval of a special use permit. The Administrator shall accept no special use permit\napplication for review without such meeting having first occurred unless the Administrator determines that such meeting would\nnot serve any meaningful purpose and waives the meeting requirement.\n(2) Procedures for application submittal are as follows:\n(a) A complete special use permit application that is signed by the applicant and which is accompanied by a submittal fee\nshall be filed with the Administrator.\n(b) The application shall be accompanied by a drawing or plan, drawn to scale, that includes or is accompanied by the\nfollowing:\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/downloa\n276/322\n"}, {"page": "277", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n1.

If it is proven that CO- location is not possible on an\nexisting tower, the following restrictions will apply within the BC-1 (Shopping Center) and I-2 (Light Industrial) districts:\n(a) Communication towers may be located on any publicly or privately held tract of land exceeding one acre in size, with\nthe issuance of a special use permit by the Board of Aldermen.\n(b) Towers under 30 feet in height may be erected on an existing building with the issuance of a zoning permit. Towers in\nexcess of 30 feet may be erected on existing buildings with the issuance of a special use permit by the Board of Aldermen.\n(2) In the B-1 (Neighborhood Business) district, communication towers shall be permitted, by right, upon submission to the\nZoning Administrator of proof that co-location on an existing tower is not possible. In the B-1 District the following requirements\nshall be met:\n(a) The tract of land (including the parent tract) on which the tower will be located is at least seven acres in size. (This shall\nnot preclude the development of the remainder of the parent tract for other non- residential uses permitted in the B-1 District.)\n(b) The base of the tower will be located at least 300 feet from any single-family dwelling and 300 feet from any public\nstreet.\n(c) All other provisions of this section shall apply.\n(d) In the B-1 District the Zoning Administrator may issue a permit for any communication tower under 30 feet in height to\nbe erected on any existing structure without having to meet the minimum lot size, separation requirements or other requirements\nof this section.\n(B) Type of tower permitted. Monopole towers only (no lattice or guyed towers are permitted). Any new tower permitted must\nbe able to accommodate at least three carriers. The applicant must submit construction drawings sealed by a qualified\nprofessional engineer showing and stating that the tower and supporting facilities will be able to support and accommodate at\nleast three carriers.\n(C) Tower appearance.\n(1) Towers and associated buildings and equipment shall be painted in a neutral color.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/downlo\n286/322\n"}, {"page": "287", "text": "6/26/23, 9:12 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/b2d226a3-9d65-44d0-a73a-6ec9cd0bb664/download/\n(2) All towers shall be illuminated only as required by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and FAA (Federal\nAviation Administration) and such illumination shall be directed away from residential structures.\n(3) The entire property on which the tower is located shall be screened from view of adjacent property owners with an\nopaque vegetative screen. Screening shall be in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 153.060 through 153.064. No commercial messages shall\nbe placed on towers.\n(D) Height requirements. Towers shall not exceed 199 feet in commercial or manufacturing districts.\n(E) Screening.\n(1) Towers shall be at least one foot off all property lines for each foot of tower height unless the applicant can provide\ndetailed information showing the design of the tower will collapse within itself, instead of falling to one side. If such fall zone\ninformation is provided, the setbacks for the tower shall be at least one foot off all property lines for each foot of tower height in\nexcess of 75 feet with a minimum of 50 feet regardless of tower height. For example:\n(2) In addition, all towers shall be at least 100 feet from any existing residence.\n(F) Co-location. Co-location is a desirable option and is therefore encouraged by the following means:\n(1) Before any new tower can be approved, it must be shown that existing towers are not adequate for serving customer\nneeds or for co-location; and\n(2) When co-locating, there is no necessity for an otherwise required special use approval.\n(G) Old towers/advanced technology/review.\n(1) Abandoned towers shall be removed by the carrier. Removal must take place within six months of the last use of the\ntower.\n(2) The issuance of a permit for a tower will be for a period of five years. After this time the tower owner shall submit\ndocumentation that includes information regarding the continued need for the tower and the lowest feasible tower height. If this\nlowest feasible tower height is 70% or less of the current tower height, the tower will be reduced to the lowest feasible level.\n(3) If technology changes cause the Zoning Enforcement Officer to feel that the tower height is excessive, he may require\nthe tower towner to submit documentation regarding the lowest feasible height at times other than the five-year renewal. Should\ntechnology changes render the height of the tower excessive, the Zoning Enforcement Officer may require the tower height be\nreduced or the tower be replaced or removed.\n(H) Power output and interference.\n(1) It shall be the responsibility of the carrier to present evidence that the tower output from the tower does not exceed\nfederally approved levels for exposure to electromagnetic forces.\n(2) It shall be the responsibility of the carrier to ensure that the tower does not cause any interference with television, radio\nand telephone reception of neighboring properties.\n(Ord. passed 2-9-1999; Am.
