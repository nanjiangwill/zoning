Some land uses are of such a nature or scale\nthat they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community, which\ncannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a\ngeneral district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even\nthough the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of\nthese regulations, the adopted CAMA Land Use Plan, and adopted district and area plans. The review process\nestablished for the MV-C district provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into\na conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and\nenjoyment of neighboring properties. The conditional zoning overlay district also establishes project specific\ndevelopment standards to be applied in the overlay district.\n(5) Eastern End Oceanfront Overlay District (EEO)\nAn overlay district that encompasses all of the oceanfront parcels located between 1st Street and Diann Drive.\n(A) The purpose of the Eastern End Oceanfront Overlay District is to provide, to the best extent possible, for the\nopportunity for development and redevelopment of properties that are consistent with the older established\ndwellings in the area. The Eastern End Oceanfront Overlay District only applies to oceanfront parcels between 1st\nStreet and Diann Drive that are subject to the Static Vegetation Line and eligible for the Static Line Exception.\n(B) The permitted and special uses and all density, intensity, and dimensional standards within this overlay district are\nthe same as the underlying zoning district, with the exception of a reduced front setback of 20 feet for structures\nwithin this overlay district.\n(6) Reed Drive Overlay District (RDO)\nAn overlay district that encompasses all of the parcels located between 8714 Reed Drive (PIN 538307771512000) and\n8502 Reed Drive (PIN 538308987255000).\n60 of 196\n4/13/24, 12:37\n"}, {"page": "61", "text": "Emerald Isle, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(A) The purpose of the Reed Drive Overlay District is to provide, to the best extent possible, for the opportunity for\nreduced rear yard setbacks in this area that is impacted by the presence of a 200-foot wide right-of-way for NC 58.\n(B) The permitted and special uses within this overlay district are the same as those permitted in the underlying\nzoning district, except that the setback from the NC 58 property line may be fifteen (15) feet instead of the\nunderlying district's thirty (30) feet setback.\nChapter 4: - USE REGULATIONS\n4.1 USE TABLE\n4.1.1 - Definition of Permitted Uses and Special Uses\n(1) Permitted Use\nA use permitted in one (1) or more zoning districts as a matter of right provided and the land and structures and the\nuse itself otherwise meet the remaining requirements of this Ordinance. Uses permitted in the various districts are\nindicated by a \"P\" mark in the appropriate column(s) of Table 4.1. Permitted uses are required to comply with all\napplicable requirements of Section 4.2, Use-Specific Standards, and all other applicable standards of this Ordinance.\n(2) Special Use\nA use within one (1) or more zoning districts that is not a use by right, but that is required to meet the terms,\nconditions, and requirements for special uses and for which a special use permit is required to have been issued by\nthe Board of Commissioners Special uses that may be allowed in the various districts are indicated by an \"S\" mark in\nthe appropriate column(s) of Table 4.1. Permitted uses are required to comply with all applicable requirements of\nSection 4.2, Use-Specific Standards, and Chapter 5, Density, Intensity, and Dimensional Standards, unless any such\nrequirement is modified or waived by the Board of Commissioners in the special use permit, as well as with all other\napplicable standards of this Ordinance.\n(3) Prohibited Use\nAny use that is not indicated by a \"P\" or an \"S\" for a specific zoning district in Table 4.1 is a prohibited use in that\ndistrict, and is indicated by an empty cell in the table.\n(4) Overlay Districts\nPermitted and Special Uses in each overlay zoning district are the same as those available in that portion of the base\ndistrict(s) in which the overlay applies, unless the terms of the overlay zoning district specifically prohibit the use. In\naddition, because of site-specific conditions or other factors, the terms and provisions of overlay districts may restrict\nor prohibit the availability or practicability of a use listed as a permitted or special use on or more base districts in\nTable 4.1. Applicants are urged to review all applicable overlay district provisions in conjunction with the provisions of\nthis Chapter.\n(5) Accessory Uses\nAccessory Uses are defined in Chapter 10. Such uses may only exist so long as the principal use of the property is in\nexistence and not in violation of this Ordinance. Accessory uses may not be established before a principal use is in\noperation, and may not continue after the principal use has ceased operation.\n4.1.2 - Table of Permitted and Special Uses\nPermitted and special uses for each of the zoning districts, and cross-references to use-specific standards applicable to\nsome uses, are shown in Table 4.1.\n61 of 196\n4/13/24, 12:37\n"},

Those areas that are not to be\ndisturbed shall be protected by an adequate barrier from construction activity. Whenever possible, indigenous\nvegetation shall be retained and protected. Where this is not possible, suitable nature species shall be planted.\n(C) Erosion and Sediment Control Devices\n(i) No grading, cutting or filling shall be commenced until erosion and sedimentation control devices have been\ninstalled between the disturbed area and water bodies, watercourses and wetlands. Following initial soil\ndisturbance or redisturbance, permanent or temporary stabilization shall be completed on all perimeter dikes,\nswales, ditches, perimeter slopes, all slopes greater than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical (3:1), and\nembankments of ponds. Requirements for permanent stabilization shall not apply to those areas being used\nfor material storage or for those areas where construction activities are currently being performed.\n(ii) For new residential and commercial construction projects without an existing driveway connection at the\nstreet, required erosion and sediment control devices shall include a stone construction entrance at each\nvehicular entrance to disturbed site to help preserve the road edge and retain sediment on site.\n(iii) Clean sand shall be used for fill. The fines in the sand should be limited so that seepage and migration through\nit will facilitate normal drainage.

Water shall be released from\ndetention ponds into water bodies, watercourses or wetlands at a rate and in a manner approximating the natural\nflow that would have occurred before development. The drawdown rate for these ponds shall also be designed so\nthat the water quality volume is drained no faster than forty-eight (48) hours but no slower than one hundred\ntwenty (120) hours.\n(L) Removal of Suspended Solids\nFor projects that disturb more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of land, all stormwater management\nsystems shall be designed in accordance with the state standards meeting the eighty-five (85) percent total\nsuspended solids removal rate.\n(M) Usage of Wetlands\nAlthough the use of wetlands for storing and purifying water is encouraged, care must be taken not to overload\ntheir capacity, thereby harming the wetlands and transitional vegetation. Wetlands should not be damaged by the\nconstruction of detention ponds.\n(N) Infiltration Method Design\nAll development must provide appropriate infiltration to control runoff of rainfall from all impervious surfaces on\nsite as specified in Section 6.3.2. The design of the infiltration method must take into account the runoff from any\npervious surface drainage that is directed to the infiltration site. Flow from gutters and downspouts shall be\ndiverted to the infiltration site, as necessary.\n(O) Underground Storage of Runoff\nAll underground storage of runoff shall be accomplished so that there is a minimum of two (2) feet vertical\nseparation between the highest seasonal water table and the bottom of the feature(s) used for storage.\n(P) Treatment of Runoff from Parking Lots\nRunoff from parking lots shall be treated to remove oil and sediment before it enters receiving waterbodies.\n(Q) Detention and Retention Area Design\nDetention and retention areas shall be designed so that shorelines are sinuous rather than straight and so that\nlength of shoreline is maximized, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral vegetation.\n(R) Detention and Retention Area Slopes\nWith the exception of bulkheaded ponds, the banks of detention and retention areas shall slope at a grade no\nsteeper than 3 to 1 (horizontal run to vertical rise) into an area of water as a safeguard against drowning, personal\ninjury or other accidents, to encourage the growth of vegetation and to allow the alternate flooding and exposure\nof areas along the shore as water levels periodically rise and fall.\n(S)\n119 of 196\n4/13/24, 12:37\n"}, {"page": "120", "text": "Emerald Isle, NC Code of Ordinances\nUsage of Drainage Facilities\nThe multiple use of drainage facilities and vegetated buffer zones as open space, recreation and conservation\nareas is encouraged.\n(T) Filling of Wetlands or Ponds\nLot owners or contractors may not fill more than one thousand (1,000) square feet of any part of a pond or\nwetland unless that pond or wetland is expanded or a new retention area is built as a replacement, provided the\nfollowing conditions are met:\nThe applicant receives approval from the appropriate Federal and/or State regulatory agencies,\nThe applicant receives approval from the Town of Emerald Isle, and\nAny expansion or new retention area shall be constructed within the Town limits of Emerald Isle, and be capable\nof holding a volume of stormwater at least equal to the one lost as a result of the fill.\nIf this should preclude any reasonable development of the lot, the applicant may apply to the Board of Adjustment\nfor a variance.\n(U) Discharge of Stormwater\nNew discharges to SA or SB waters and/or expansion of existing conveyance systems which discharge directly to\nSA or SB waters shall be prohibited.\nFor projects that disturb more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of land, diffuse flow of stormwater at a\nnonerosive velocity to a vegetated buffer or other natural area capable of providing effective infiltration of the\nrunoff from the one-year, 24-hour storm prior to reaching any potential off-site discharge shall no be considered a\ndirect point of stormwater discharge. Consideration shall be given to soil type, slope, vegetation, and existing\nhydrology when making a qualitative determination of infiltration effectiveness.\n(V) AEC Development\nDevelopment within the area of environmental concern (AEC) adjacent to outstanding resource waters (ORW), as\ndefined by the North Carolina Division of Coastal Management, shall not exceed thirty-six (36) percent impervious\ncoverage and shall adhere to the stormwater management standards of the North Carolina Division of Coastal\nManagement, or any successor agency (which may limit coverage to twenty-five (25) percent). The standards of the\nNorth Carolina Division of Coastal Management shall take precedence over the standards included in this Section\n6.3, provided, however, that the developer shall also be required to adhere to the specific standards included in\nthis Section 6.3 that are not in conflict with the standards of the North Carolina Division of Coastal Management.\nRedevelopment activities which have no net increase in impervious surface and which provides equal or greater\nstormwater controls than the previous development shall not be subject to the impervious area limitations\ncontained in this paragraph.\n(W) Prohibited Artificial Recharge\nBecause this practice reduces stormwater runoff storage capacity, the artificial recharge of natural ponds and/or\nman-made detention and retention ponds with groundwater or other water supplies is prohibited.
