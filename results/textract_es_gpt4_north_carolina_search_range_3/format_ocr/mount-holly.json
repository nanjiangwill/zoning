The purpose is to establish a district for the purpose of maintaining agricultural\nand residential uses of the land and provide for a gradual transition into office or light industrial uses by way of case-\nby-case rezoning; while discouraging residential subdivisions and commercial land use which would be incompatible\nwith future office and light industrial developments. Also, reasonable safeguards for the protection of existing\nresidential uses will be employed. This district is particularly well-suited to accommodate industrial growth from the\naspects of the transportation network, efficient use of public services and facilities, land form, general compatibility of\nuse and other pertinent considerations.\n(B) R-20SF, Single-Family Residential. The purpose is to establish a district to ensure that the principal land use of\nthe land is for low-density residential development not having access to public water supplies and dependent upon\nseptic tanks for sewage disposal will occur at sufficiently low densities to provide a healthful environment. The\nminimum lot size established for this district, however, does not guarantee sufficient space for on-site water and/or\nsewer systems. In establishing this district, it is intended that as public water and sewer are provided to property within\nthe district that the property, on a case-by-case basis, can be considered for more intensive land use.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download\n32/191\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "6/26/23, 9:29 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download/\n(C) R-12SF, Single-Family Residential District. The purpose is to establish a district in which the principal use of\nland is for single-family residential purposes. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas for those\npersons desiring smaller residences and to discourage any use which would substantially interfere with the quiet\nresidential nature of this district. It is expected that municipal water and sewer facilities will be available to each lot in\nsuch districts.\n(D) R-10SF, Single-Family Residential District. The purpose is to establish a district in which the principal use of\nland is for single-family residential purposes. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas for those\npersons desiring smaller residences and to discourage any use which would substantially interfere with the quiet\nresidential nature of this district. It is expected that municipal water and sewer facilities will be available to each lot in\nsuch districts.\n(E) R-8SF, Single-Family Residential District. The purpose is to establish a district in which the principal use of land\nis for single-family residential purposes. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community\nfor those persons desiring small residences in medium density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to\nprohibit any use which because of its character, would interfere with the quiet residential nature of this district. It is\nexpected that municipal water and sewer facilities will be available to each lot in such districts.\n(F) R-8MF, Multi-Family Residential District.

The purpose is to establish a district for those businesses and services which\ngenerally serve a wider area than neighborhood businesses, but do not necessarily require location in the central\nbusiness district. Because these commercial uses are important to the economy of the community and subject to\nhigher vehicular use, they should have ample parking, controlled traffic movement and suitable site design.\n(K) L-I, Light Industrial District. The purpose is to establish and preserve areas for industrial and related uses of\nsuch a nature that they do not create serious problems of compatibility with other kinds of land uses and to make\nprovisions for certain kinds of commercial uses which are most appropriately located as neighbors of industrial use\nwhich are necessary to service the immediate needs of people in these areas.\n(L) H-I, Heavy Industrial District.

The districts are:\n(1) MHA, Manufactured Home Overlay District; and\n(2) MHP, Manufactured Home Park Overlay District.\n(C) AOB, Adult Oriented Business Overlay District. The purpose of this overlay district is to provide areas in which\nadult entertainment or sexually oriented businesses may be established. Adult establishments, because of their very\nnature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics upon adjacent neighborhoods and\nresidential or institutional uses. It has been demonstrated that the establishment of adult businesses often creates\nproblems for law enforcement agencies, by the very nature of these businesses and the difficulty often experienced in\ntrying to determine if the operations are of a legal nature. Special regulation of these establishments is necessary to\nensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to a de facto downgrading or blighting of surrounding\nneighborhoods and uses. It is the intent of this overlay district to restrict the concentration of these uses and to\nseparate these uses from residential and institutional uses or areas. The AOB Overlay District shall only be permitted\nto overlay the B-3 or CU-B-3 General Business Districts.\n(D) HD, Historic Overlay District. The HD Historic Overlay District establishes regulations which will help maintain\nthe historic integrity of certain areas within the city.\n(E) South Gateway Overlay District.\n(1) Purpose. The purpose is to establish more restrictive requirements for permitted uses in the South Gateway\nOverlay District near I-85, including design regulations for commercial structures. The land in the overlay is subject to\nnot only the requirements of the underlying zoning district, but also the additional requirements of the overlay district.\n(2) B-3 General Business. The land in the overlay is identified in the gateway to require greater standards for\nsetbacks with the proximity of the Highway 273 Corridor, which vary from the same zoning district in outside of the\noverlay district.\n(F) Downtown Gateway Overlay District.\n(1) Purpose. On 4-13-2009, City Council established the Downtown Gateway Overlay District, with the base\nzoning of B-1 Central Business District. The Manual for Development for Downtown Mount Holly, an adopted\nappendix to the Zoning Ordinance, shall serve as the governing document for the Downtown Gateway Overlay\nDistrict.\n(2) Amendment. Additionally, on 8-12-2013, City Council approved the following text amendment to the Manual\nfor Development in Downtown Mount Holly: medical facilities greater than 25,000 square feet in size are exempt from\nthe design regulations for new commercial buildings found in \u00a7 5 of the Manual for Development in Downtown Mount\nHolly. However, no use shall be exempt from the parking, landscaping, building material and connectivity\nrequirements found in the manual and the corresponding sections of the zoning ordinance.\n(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)\n\u00a7 4.3 CONDITIONAL DISTRICT.\n(A) Purpose. The purpose is to establish a legislative process, in which site plans and individualized development\nconditions are imposed. It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at particular\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download/\n34/191\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "6/26/23, 9:29 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download/\nlocations in the absence of special conditions.\n(B) Consideration. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in such\nsituations, the conditional district is a means by which such individualized development conditions can be imposed in\nthe furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance. The conditional district classification will be considered only upon\nrequest of all applicant property owners for rezoning. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these\nregulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of\nthis\nordinance that the authorization of such conditional district shall be null and void and of no effect and that proceedings\nbe instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification. See \u00a7 14.5 for further guidelines on\nconditional district.

A maintenance agreement shall be filed with the property deeds;\nand\n(g) Cluster development shall transport storm water runoff from the development by vegetated conveyances to\nthe maximum extent practicable.\n(5) All development in Watershed Overlay Districts shall, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize built-upon\nsurface area, direct storm water runoff away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices (BMPs)\nto minimize water quality impacts.\n(6) Existing development, as defined in this ordinance, is not subject to the requirement of the overlay provisions.\nExpansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of these provisions;\nprovided, however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in the density\ncalculations. In determining expansions to existing development, the maximum permitted additional built-upon area is\nderived by multiplying the area of the portion of the property that is not built-upon by the appropriate percent built-\nupon limitation for the Overlay District in which the property is located.\n(7) A pre-existing lot created prior to the effective date of this ordinance, regardless of whether or not a vested\nright has been established, may be developed or redeveloped for single-family residential purposes without being\nsubject to the restrictions of these overlay provisions.\n(8) Any existing building or built-upon area not in conformance with the limitations of these provisions that has\nbeen damaged or removed for any reason may be repaired and/or reconstructed; provided:\n(a) Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and completed within two years of such damage or\nremoval;\n(b) The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be increased; and\n(c) The repair or reconstruction is otherwise permitted under the provisions of this ordinance.\n(9) No activity, situation, structure or land use shall be permitted or allowed to operate within a watershed which\nposes a threat to water quality and the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions may arise from inadequate\non-site sewage systems which utilize ground water absorption; inadequate sedimentation and erosion control\nmeasures; the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area; the absence or improper\nimplementation of a spill containment plan for toxic and hazardous materials; the improper management of storm\nwater runoff; or any other situation found to pose a threat to water quality.\n(10) The Zoning Enforcement Officer may require such information on subdivision, zoning compliance permit and\ndevelopment plan applications, including the density/built-upon area calculations, as he may deem necessary to\ndetermine compliance with Watershed Overlay District provisions. Preliminary and final subdivision plat approval and\nother such plan approvals may be required to note density/built-upon limitations on the plat. For example, plats may\nbe required to show such information as total area of the development, the amount and percent of impervious area in\nstreets and sidewalks, the amount and percent of impervious area in other public improvements and the amount and\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/downloa\n54/191\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "6/26/23, 9:29 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download/\npercent of impervious area that is allocated to the various lots for future development.

Fences used for buffering purposes shall be constructed in a durable fashion\nwith weather resistant wood and be of consistent pattern. All materials used in the construction of a fence shall be\ndesigned and intended for such use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may approve a buffer fence\nconstructed of other materials; provided, the materials and finish used will provide generally the same degree of\nopacity, durability and aesthetic compatibility with adjoining residential areas as weather resistant wood. A finished\nside of all walls or fences shall face the common property line boundary.

All berms shall be planted with both shrubs and ground covers so as to leave no bare\nearth. All shrubs shall be a species that can be expected to materially buffer the development site within five years of\nplanting. The slope of a berm shall be of a grade so that it is suitable for maintenance and soil stability while taking\ninto consideration the type of plantings and ground cover that will be utilized, but in no case shall a berm be less than\nthree feet in height. The use of Pueraria lobata (kudzu) for berm ground cover is not permitted, nor is any other\nnuisance veining plants that have a tendency to spread to other properties.\n(7) Location of buffer yard. With the exception of buffering required for open storage any buffer yard required by\nthis\nsection shall be located along the side and/or rear property lines of the lot(s) containing the use subject to\nbuffering. If buffering is required along the right-of-way, it shall be located behind such right-of-way.\n(8) Evergreen shrubs. For all buffer yards, at least 50% of the required shrubs must be of an evergreen species.\n(9) Interior plantings of parking lots.\n(a) This requirement shall be met for all parking areas with more than ten parking spaces.\n(b) The parking lot shall be landscaped with canopy trees as required by this section at the rate shown below.\nThis requirement shall be initiated by the initial use or development of the property. Canopy trees shall be provided at\na rate of one canopy tree for each ten parking spaces. After the first two trees, any fractional remaining number of\nspaces over five shall require one additional tree. Required canopy trees shall be distributed throughout the parking\narea and shall be located within or adjacent to parking lots as tree islands, at the end of parking bays, inside medians\nor between rows of parking spaces. Canopy trees must be a minimum of ten feet in height and two inches in diameter,\nmeasured six inches above grade a planting. When mature, a canopy tree should be at least 50 feet in height and\nhave a minimum crown width of 30 feet. A list of approved tree species can be found in \u00a7 10.4 of this ordinance.\n(c) In addition, in any case where ten parking spaces are added, whether required or not, the entire parking lot\nincluding existing parking areas shall be landscaped if the total number of parking spaces on the lot equals more than\nten parking spaces. Canopy trees must be planted directly adjacent to parking areas or located in a parking lot\nplanting strip. If a parking lot planting strip is constructed, then the strip must be a minimum of 274 square feet with a\nminimum width of eight feet.\n(d) If parking lot lighting is installed in a landscaped island, then the lighting should be designed to\naccommodate the trees planted in the island.\n(e) The use of differing species around the parking area is encouraged to promote diversity in the overall urban\ntree canopy. The use of existing vegetation to satisfy this requirement is encouraged. Existing trees may receive this\ncredit however; they must meet the requirements stated above for species and minimum diameter and height\nrequirements.

The Planning Commission shall\nhold a public hearing on the proposed amendment in accordance with its rules of procedure. The Planning Director\nshall cause public notice to be made as is required in accordance with the Commission's rules.\n(B) The Planning Commission shall either recommend in favor of an amendment or in opposition to an amendment\nby simple majority vote of those present and voting. The Commission may also propose conditions to their\nrecommendation. A tie vote on a proposal shall be considered to be in opposition to such amendment. If the Planning\nCommission should fail to act on any proposal within 30 days after it is first presented to the Commission such failure\nto act shall be considered to be a favorable recommendation for the purposes of this procedure.\n(C) When conducting a review of proposed zoning text or map amendments pursuant to this section, the Planning\nCommission shall advise and comment on whether the proposed action is consistent with any comprehensive plan\nthat has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Commission shall provide\na written recommendation to the governing board that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed\nappropriate by the Planning Commission, but a comment by the Planning Commission that a proposed amendment is\ninconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by\nthe governing board. If a Zoning Map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the\nPlanning Commission statement describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the\nanalysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the recommendation made.\n(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)\n\u00a7 14.4 CITY COUNCIL ACTION.\n(A) The Planning Director shall present any proposed amendments and the Commission's recommendations to the\nCity Council at its next regular scheduled meeting at which it considers setting public hearings for zoning amendment\nproposals. The Planning Director shall transmit to the City Council such information from the action of the Planning\nCommission as, in his or her opinion, constitutes the Board's record on the proposed amendments.\n(B) The City Council shall take such lawful action on such proposals as it may deem advisable provided that no\nzoning amendment shall be adopted until after a public hearing shall have been held and public notice given as\nrequired by law.\n(C) When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the governing board shall approve a brief\nstatement describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. The\nrequirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the governing\nboard that at the time of action on the amendment the governing board was aware of and considered the planning\nboard's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If a zoning map amendment\nis adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the\neffect of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a\nplan amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The\nplan consistency statement is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale\nrezoning\" under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the governing board statement describing plan consistency may address the\noverall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the\naction taken.\n(D) (1) When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a statement analyzing the\nreasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be approved by the governing board. This statement of\nreasonableness may consider, among other factors:\n(a) The size, physical conditions and other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned;\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download/\n155/191\n"}, {"page": "156", "text": "6/26/23, 9:29 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download/\n(b) The benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors and the surrounding community;\n(c) The relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas\nand the development that would be permissible under the proposed amendment;\n(d) Why the action taken is in the public interest; and\n(e) Any changed conditions warranting the amendment.\n(2) If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the governing\nboard statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.\n(E) The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be\napproved as a single statement.\n(Ord. passed 5-13-1996)\n\u00a7 14.5 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS (CD).\n(A) Application.\n(1) Petitioning for a CD Zoning District is a voluntary procedure and can be initiated by all owners of the property\nto be included.

When dealing\nwith the conditional zoning district process, it may be desirable to request additional information in order to evaluate a\nproposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area. Therefore, the Planning Commission and/or City Council\nmay request additional information [in addition to that required above], as they deem necessary.\n(B) Procedures.\n(1) A pre-application meeting between the applicant and the Administrator shall be required in order to familiarize\nthe applicant of the procedure for securing approval of a conditional zoning. The Administrator shall accept no\nconditional zoning application for review without such meeting having first occurred unless the Administrator\ndetermines that such meeting would not serve any meaningful purpose and waives the meeting requirement.\n(2) Procedures for application submittal are as follows:\n(a) A complete conditional zoning application that is signed by the applicant and which is accompanied by a\nsubmittal fee (in accordance with a fee scheduled approved by City Council) shall be filed with the Administrator;\nand\n(b) The application shall be accompanied by a drawing or plan, drawn to scale, that includes or is accompanied\nby the following:\n1.

Any required drawing or depiction of the proposed\ndevelopment or use shall not appear on the tax maps, but rather shall appear on the drawing or plan.);\n3. The name and addresses of all owners, tax parcel numbers and existing land use(s) of all contiguous\nproperties;\n4. Proposed use of all land and structures including the number of residential units proposed, if any, and total\nsquare footage of non-residential development;\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download\n156/191\n"}, {"page": "157", "text": "6/26/23, 9:29 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/166a2d29-a44c-424f-a57d-67dab43b8507/download/\n5.

The Administrator reserves the right to waive the depiction of some or all of the information contained in\ndivisions (B)(2)(b)5. through (B)(2)(b)10. above when, in his or her opinion, such information is not a requirement of\nthis ordinance for the particular conditional use being requested. Notwithstanding, if either the Planning Commission\nor City Council determines that additional information as set forth in divisions (B)(2)(b)5. through (B)(2)(b)10. above is\nneeded to render a recommendation or decision on the application, they may require the applicant to submit such\nadditional information; and\n13. In lieu of showing all of the information in divisions (B)(2)(b)5. through (B)(2)(b)11. above, the applicant\nmay submit a general development plan which shows on the proposed site, by land use type, the areas to be\ndeveloped for buildings and parking and shall show all points of ingress and egress onto thoroughfares and collector\nstreets.\n(C) Public involvement meeting.\n(1) Once the requisite number of complete applications has been submitted to the Administrator and the requisite\nfees have been paid, and prior to the public hearing on the rezoning request, a public involvement meeting (PIM) shall\nbe scheduled and held.

It is\nrecommended (but not mandated) that this portion of the PIM take place at the proposed development site. In\naddition, a second one-hour (minimum) meeting should be scheduled at a conveniently located meeting site agreed\nupon by the applicant and the Administrator. Notwithstanding the above, a PIM may last for different amounts of time,\ndepending on the nature of the development, its location and the number of parties involved and/or attending the\nmeeting.\n(c) Notice of the PIM shall at a minimum, be given as follows.\n1. A public notice shall be sent by the City of Mount Holly to a newspaper having general circulation in the\nCity of Mount Holly not less than ten days or more than 25 days prior to the date of the PIM.\n2.

In approving a petition for the reclassification of a piece of property to a CD\nDistrict, the Planning Commission may recommend, and City Council may require, that reasonable and appropriate\nconditions be attached to approval of the petition. Such conditions shall be limited to those that address the\nconformance of the development and use of the site to City of Mount Holly ordinances and plans adopted pursuant to\nG.S. \u00a7 160D-501, or other plan and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the\ndevelopment or use of the site. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any\nadditional requirements prior to approval or denial by the governing board. In no instance shall any of these conditions\nbe less restrictive than any requirements that would otherwise pertain to that particular development if it were located\nin a general or parallel conditional zoning district. Such conditions may exceed any performance criteria or minimum\nrequirements listed elsewhere in this ordinance that pertain to that development. Statements that analyze whether the\nrezoning is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan and other matters\nthat the City Council deems appropriate and why it considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public\ninterest shall be prepared and accompany each final decision relative to the CD rezoning request.\n(J) Effect of approval; Zoning Map designation.

No change or amendment to any permit with vested rights shall be made, except\nafter public hearing and except as provided for in this ordinance for the original issuance of such permit. If, at the time\nof consideration of proposed change or amendment to an existing permit, such permit or proposed change or\namendment could not be lawfully made under ordinance conditions existing at that time, such proposed change or\namendment shall be denied. In addition, in no case shall there be an extension of the two-year time period for which\nsuch development right is vested. Nothing herein shall exempt plans related to such permit from subsequent reviews\nand approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval; provided that, such\nreviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approvals.\n(E) Status at expiration of term. A right which has been vested shall terminate at the end of the two-year vesting\nperiod with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed.
