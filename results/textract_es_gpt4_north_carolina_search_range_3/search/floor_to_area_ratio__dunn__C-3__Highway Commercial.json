The TIA helps identify where the development may have a significant\nimpact on safety, traffic and transportation operations, and provides a means for the developer and government\nagencies to mitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be used to evaluate whether the scale of development is\nappropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe and\nefficient access and traffic flow.\nA. WHEN REQUIRED\nA standard Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be prepared by a qualified professional engineer registered to\npractice in North Carolina and submitted with the initial application for any development that exceed the\nfollowing:\nB. MINIMUM CONTENT REQUIREMENTS\nThe recommendations provided in the TIA shall at a minimum be based on the following:\n1. The TIA shall propose geometric and/or traffic control improvements which will be required to prevent the\ntraffic generated by the proposed development from causing any intersection or roadway approach within\nthe study area to fall below an overall Level of Service (LOS) D, as defined by the latest edition of the\nHighway Capacity Manual (HCM).\n2.\nFor intersections projected to operate worse than LOS D for background (future without proposed\ndevelopment) conditions, the TIA shall propose geometric and/or traffic control improvements which will\nbe required to minimize the increase in average overall intersection delay when traffic generated by the\nproposed development is at least 10% of the projected total a.m. or p.m. peak hour traffic at the\nintersection.\n3. Stop-controlled minor street approaches to intersections may exceed LOS D provided the addition of\ndevelopment traffic at the intersection is not anticipated to warrant a traffic signal upon build-out and the\nresulting congestion does not block traffic movements at adjacent intersections.\n4.\nAt existing or proposed stop-controlled intersections, guidelines provided by the North Carolina\nDepartment of Transportation (NCDOT) shall be used in the evaluation of the need for and length of\nexclusive right and/or left turn lanes to support development traffic.\n5.\nFor any and all turning movements in the study area where the development is anticipated to add at least\n10% to the existing a.m. or p.m. peak hour traffic volume, and the existing storage available within the\nturn bay(s) is shown to be exceeded by existing or projected traffic, the TIA shall propose improvements\nwhich may be required to mitigate the impact of development traffic.\nCITY OF DUNN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n3-34\nADOPTION DATE: 04.11.2023\nCELL (1, 1): \nRESIDENTIAL\nCELL (1, 2): \nOFFICE\nCELL (1, 3): \nHOTEL\nCELL (1, 4): \nINDUSTRIAL\nCELL (1, 5): \nRETAIL/SHOPPING\nCELL (1, 6): \nOTHER\nCELL (2, 1): \n100 units\n(cumulative)\nCELL (2, 2): \n50,000 sf\nCELL (2, 3): \n100 rooms\nCELL (2, 4): \n150 employees\nCELL (2, 5): \n100,000 sf\nCELL (2, 6): \nOver 100\npeak hour\ntrips\n\nNEW PAGE 53\nARTICLE 4\nZONING DISTRICTS\nARTICLE 4 - ZONING DISTRICTS\n4.01\nZONING MAP\nThe boundaries of each zoning district are shown on a map entitled \"City of Dunn Official Zoning Map\"\nwhich is hereby made a portion of this ordinance.
