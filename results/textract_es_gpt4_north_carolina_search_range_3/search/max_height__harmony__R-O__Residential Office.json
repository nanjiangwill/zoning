Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned\nto such a district in such situations, the Conditional Zoning District is a means by which such\nspecial conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance. The\nConditional Zoning District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner or authorized agent.\nTherefore, the following Conditional Zoning Districts (CD) which correspond to each of the\ndistricts authorized by this ordinance are established: RA-CD, RU-R-CD, R-20-CD, R-O-CD, O-\nI-CD, N-B-CD, H-B-CD, M-1-CD.\nSection 4.9.2 Uses\nWithin a CD, only those uses authorized as permitted uses in the zoning district with which the\nCD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall\nbe met as minimum standards.\nSection 4.10 Permitted Uses\nSection 4.10.1 General\nThe Table of Permitted Uses and Special Uses which follows contains a listing of uses which may\nbe permitted in one or more of the various Zoning Districts established by this Ordinance.
