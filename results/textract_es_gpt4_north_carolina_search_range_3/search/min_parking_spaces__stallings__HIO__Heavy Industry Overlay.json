In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to seventy-five (75%) percent for the\narea located within the scenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a ten (10) acre property zoned Single Family Residential\n(SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic Corridor Overlay. The density is\ncalculated as follows:\nBase density @ 3 units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic\ncorridor easement\n50% of (2 acres x 3 units/acre) = 3 unit bonus Total Density = 33units\nIf the Jones' provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a seventy-five\n(75%) density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider\neasement 75% of (2 acres x 3 ts/acre) = 4.5 unit bonus Total Density = 35 units\n(c.)

Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 12\n\nNEW PAGE 172\n(19.) Conditional Zoning (CZ)\n8.3\nDescription of Districts\nThe districts created by this ordinance are described as follows:\nThe Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural\nproduction, agricultural-based businesses, and related activities. Farmland is a\ndefining element of Stallings's traditional identity and the protection of these lands\naids in preserving the character of the Town. Listed uses are limited, with an\nemphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature.\nDevelopment density is very low to encourage preservation of agricultural lands\nwhile discouraging large lot residential development. The Agriculture District can\nalso be used to protect open spaces.\nThe Single-Family Residential Districts (SFR-1, SFR-2, SFR-3, and SFR-MH)\nprovide for the completion of existing residential neighborhoods and the\ndevelopment of new residential neighborhoods. Allowed building/lot types in the\nSingle-Family Districts are Detached House. Listed uses are restricted to single\nfamily homes and their accessory uses. Neighborhoods in these districts are the\ndominant land use in Stallings and are a major element in defining the character of\nthe community. Standards for the Single-Family Residential Districts promote that\nnew development maintains the character of the community. The Single-Family\nResidential Districts permit the completion and conformity of conventional\nresidential subdivisions already existing or approved in sketch plan form by the\nTown of Stallings prior to the effective date of these regulations.\nThe Multi-Family Residential Transitional District (MFT) provides for the\ncompletion of existing multi-family residential neighborhoods in the residential\narea(s). The intent of this district is to recognize that gradual transformation of\nexisting development to high quality mixed density residential development is\nneeded to support the central core of the Town. Higher density residential\ndevelopment allows a greater number of households to walk or bike, thus reducing\nthe parking demand and providing environmental and health benefits. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached House, and\nMulti-family Building. Streets in the Multi-Family Residential Transitional District\nshould be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from\nStallings's Town Center and other mixed-use districts to the Single-Family\nResidential districts surrounding these neighborhoods. A range of housing types is\nencouraged. Criteria for the mix of building types establishes compatibility.\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 13\n", "page_number": 170, "page_range": [170, 171, 172], "highlight": ["<em>Single</em> <em>Family</em> Residential (SFR-1)\n(3.) <em>Single</em> <em>Family</em> Residential (SFR-2)\n(4.)", "<em>Single</em> <em>Family</em> Residential (SFR-3)\n(5.) <em>Single</em> <em>Family</em> Residential Mobile Home (SFR-MH)\n(6.)", "<em>Heavy</em> <em>Industry</em> <em>Overlay</em> (<em>HIO</em>)\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 12\n\nNEW PAGE 172\n(19.", "Allowed building/lot types in the\n<em>Single</em>-<em>Family</em> Districts are Detached House.", "Listed uses are restricted to <em>single</em>\n<em>family</em> homes and their accessory uses."], "score": 24.721851, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Heavy Industry Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HIO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HIO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HIO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single family residence\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single family\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single-family\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [90, 91, 92, 93, 170, 171, 172, 199, 200, 201, 301, 302, 303]}
