Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned\nto such a district in such situations, the Conditional Zoning District is a means by which such\nspecial conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance. The\nConditional Zoning District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner or authorized agent.\nTherefore, the following Conditional Zoning Districts (CD) which correspond to each of the\ndistricts authorized by this ordinance are established: RA-CD, RU-R-CD, R-20-CD, R-O-CD, O-\nI-CD, N-B-CD, H-B-CD, M-1-CD.\nSection 4.9.2 Uses\nWithin a CD, only those uses authorized as permitted uses in the zoning district with which the\nCD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall\nbe met as minimum standards.\nSection 4.10 Permitted Uses\nSection 4.10.1 General\nThe Table of Permitted Uses and Special Uses which follows contains a listing of uses which may\nbe permitted in one or more of the various Zoning Districts established by this Ordinance. Uses\nare listed in alphabetical order in nine functional categories. The categories in the order of listing\nare:\nAgricultural and Residential Uses\nRecreational Uses\nEducational and Institutional Uses\nBusiness, Professional and Personal Services\nRetail Trade\nWholesale Trade\nManufacturing and Industrial Uses\nPublic Works Facilities, Utilities and Infrastructure\nOther\nSection 4.10.2 Entries\nThe District or Districts in which a particular listed use may be permitted is indicated by an \"X\"\nor \"S\" in the District column(s) opposite the listed use.\n20\n\nNEW PAGE 26\nSection 4.10.3 Meaning of Entries\nThe meaning of the entries in the Table are as follows:\n1. \"X\" indicates the use is permitted by right and a zoning permit may be obtained.\n2. \"S\" indicates the use requires approval of a Special Use Permit in accordance with the\nprocedures of Section 16.4.\nThe column on the far right, labeled \"SR\" (Special Requirements) means that there are special\nadditional performance requirements that the use must comply with in its development. These\nrequirements are contained in Chapter 5, \"Special Requirements to the Table of Permitted and\nSpecial Uses.\" For any use subject to a Special Requirement, the Special Requirement shall\nrepresent the minimum conditions for issuance of a Conditional Rezoning or a Special Use Permit.\nIn determining proposed uses, the Zoning Administrator shall refer to the latest edition of the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS). When a proposed use is NOT specifically\nlisted in the Table of Permitted Uses, the Zoning Administrator shall use NAICS to determine if\nthe use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use in form and function. If the Zoning\nAdministrator finds that the proposed use in the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use, he\nshall classify the proposed use as the listed use. If the Zoning Administrator finds that proposed\nuse is NOT the same as, or is NOT manifestly similar to, a listed use, then the Zoning\nAdministrator shall classify the proposed use as NOT permitted.\nThe listing of a use in the Table of Permitted Uses and Special Uses in no way relieves that use of\nhaving to meet all local, State and Federal laws pertaining to the establishment and operation of\nthat use.\nSection 4.11 Table of Permitted and Special Uses\nSection 4.11.2 Agricultural & Residential Uses\n21\nCELL (1, 1): \nUSES\nCELL (1, 2): \nRA\nCELL (1, 3): \nRU\nR\nCELL (1, 4): \nR20\nCELL (1, 5): \nRO\nCELL (1, 6): \nOI\nCELL (1, 7): \nNB\nCELL (1, 8): \nHB\nCELL (1, 9): \nM1\nCELL (1, 10): \nR\nCELL (2, 1): \nAccessory building & structures\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \nCELL (2, 8): \nCELL (2, 9): \nCELL (2, 10): \nCELL (3, 1): \nAgricultural tourism\nCELL (3, 2): \nS\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (3, 6): \nCELL (3, 7): \nCELL (3, 8): \nCELL (3, 9): \nCELL (3, 10): \n48\nCELL (4, 1): \nBed and breakfast\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \nCELL (4, 7): \nCELL (4, 8): \nCELL (4, 9): \nCELL (4, 10): \n1\nCELL (5, 1): \nBona fide farm building\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (5, 6): \nCELL (5, 7): \nCELL (5, 8): \nCELL (5, 9): \nCELL (5, 10): \nCELL (6, 1): \nCluster development, residential\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (6, 3): \nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (6, 5): \nCELL (6, 6): \nCELL (6, 7): \nCELL (6, 8): \nCELL (6, 9): \nCELL (6, 10): \n2\nCELL (7, 1): \nDwelling, conventional or modular:\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (7, 6): \nCELL (7, 7): \n-\nCELL (7, 8): \n-\nCELL (7, 9): \n-\nCELL (7, 10): \n-\nCELL (8, 1): \nAccessory dwelling unit\nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \nCELL (8, 5): \nCELL (8, 6): \nCELL (8, 7): \nCELL (8, 8): \nCELL (8, 9): \nCELL (8, 10): \n46\nCELL (9, 1): \nSingle-family detached\nCELL (9, 2): \nCELL (9, 3): \nCELL (9, 4): \nCELL (9, 5): \nCELL (9, 6): \nCELL (9, 7): \nCELL (9, 8): \nCELL (9, 9): \nCELL (9, 10): \nCELL (10, 1): \nTwo-family (duplex)\nCELL (10, 2): \nCELL (10, 3): \nCELL (10, 4): \nCELL (10, 5): \nCELL (10, 6): \nCELL (10, 7): \nCELL (10, 8): \nCELL (10, 9): \nCELL (10, 10): \n4\nCELL (11, 1): \nMulti-family\nCELL (11, 2): \nCELL (11, 3): \nCELL (11, 4): \nCELL (11, 5): \nX\nCELL (11, 6): \nCELL (11, 7): \nCELL (11, 8): \nCELL (11, 9): \nCELL (11, 10): \n4\nCELL (12, 1): \nDwelling, manufactured home, individual\nlot:\nCELL (12, 2): \nCELL (12, 3): \n-\nCELL (12, 4): \n-\nCELL (12, 5): \n-\nCELL (12, 6): \n-\nCELL (12, 7): \n-\nCELL (12, 8): \n-\nCELL (12, 9): \n-\nCELL (12, 10): \n-\n", "page_number": 24, "page_range": [24, 25, 26], "highlight": ["<em>Off</em>-<em>Street</em> <em>Parking</em>.", "<em>Off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> shall be provided in accordance with the requirements\nin Chapter 6.\nD.
