Permitted and prohibited uses of underlying zoning classifications\nshall remain in effect; however specific land uses may be further limited by the overlay\ndistricts. In the event that overlay district standards conflict with other existing\ndevelopment requirements, the more restrictive regulations shall apply.\nOverlay district development standards shall be applied to the following:\n(1)\nThe development of vacant land;\n(2)\nRedevelopment or expansion of existing site ground coverage, which includes\nbuildings, accessory uses or structures, parking and outdoor storage areas; and\n(3)\nAny change in use that increases development intensity and results in increased\ntraffic, water or air pollution. Examples of changes in use that may increase\ndevelopment intensity include, but are not limited to: alteration from a residential\nuse to a commercial use or from a commercial use to an industrial use.\n7.2.\nNeighborhood Protection Overlay (NPO)\n(1)\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the Neighborhood Protection Overlay (NPO) is to protect existing\nresidential development from encroachment by industrial development in those\nareas where lands zoned for, and historically used for, industrial development are\nadjacent to existing residential districts. This purpose is achieved by increasing\nthe required buffer and setback requirements for industrial development located\nwithin a minimum proximity to residential districts.\n(2)\nPermitted Uses\nAll uses permitted in the Heavy Industrial and Light Industrial zoning districts\n(Article 3) shall be regulated as conditional uses when located within two-\nhundred fifty (250) feet of any existing residence at the time of adoption of the\nzoning ordinance.\n(3)\nDimensional Standards\n(A) Applicability\nThese dimensional standards shall apply to those uses permitted in the\nHeavy Industrial and Light Industrial zoning districts.\n(B) Bufferyard\nArticle 7 - Overlay District\n7-1\n\nNEW PAGE 70\nTown of Navassa Zoning Ordinance\nBufferyards shall be provided and maintained along all property\nboundaries adjacent to land that is used or zoned for residential\npurposes. The bufferyard shall be a minimum Type II and may be a Type\nIII or Type IV as specified in Article 13 with the associated land uses in\nAppendix 1 (Table of Permitted Uses). The most restrictive bufferyard\nlanguage in Article 13 shall apply.\n(C)\nBuilding Setback\nAll buildings shall be set back no less than one-hundred (100) feet from\nany property boundary adjacent to land that is used or zoned for\nresidential purposes.\n7.3.\nBypass Overlay District (BYO)\n(1)\nApplicability\nThe Bypass Overlay District (BYO) shall be in effect in the Town of Navassa for\nall property located within six-hundred sixty feet (660') of the North Carolina\nDepartment of Transportation (NCDOT) right-of-way or planned right-of-way of\nthe US Highway 17 (Wilmington) I-140 Bypass, as measured from and\nperpendicular to each side of the highway. All structures, buildings, and land\nimprovements associated with non-residential land uses shall fall under the\nauthority of the BYO.\n(2)\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the Bypass Overlay District is to encourage development\npractices that maintain and/or enhance the natural beauty and scenic quality of\nan identified highway corridor for the benefit of the motoring public and to protect\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the motoring public by reducing impediments\nsuch as light glare, distractions, and visual clutter/obstructions. This purpose is\nachieved by addressing physical characteristics of development including:\nstructure height, right-of-way setbacks, vegetative buffers, maximum impervious\nsurface, parking and loading, outdoor storage, signage, and exterior lighting.\n(3)\nDevelopment Standards\n(A)\nStructure Height\nStructures within the BYO shall be limited in height to a maximum of forty\n(40) feet as measured from the finished ground floor elevation to the\nhighest point of the roof or structure. Chimneys, cupolas, and steeples\nare not included in measuring a structure's height.\n(B)\nRight-of-way Setback\nBuildings within the BYO shall be set back no less than one-hundred\n(100) feet from the right-of-way of the I-140 Bypass, including the full\nArticle 7 - Overlay District\n7-2\n\nNEW PAGE 71\nTown of Navassa Zoning Ordinance\nlength of controlled access right-of-way that extends away from the\nhighway at intersections.\n(C)\nBufferyard\nA bufferyard of fifty (50) feet shall be provided and maintained\nimmediately adjacent to and along each side of the bypass right-of-way,\nincluding the full length of controlled access right-of-way that extends\naway from the highway at intersections. Where public necessity requires\nthe location of major public utility lines adjacent to the 1-140 Bypass and\nthe easement or right-of-way for a line precludes provision of a bufferyard\nimmediately adjacent to the highway right-of-way, the required bufferyard\nshall be provided adjacent to the outer edge of the utility easement or\nright-of-way.\n1.\nComposition. To the greatest extent possible, existing planting\nmaterial within the buffer yard shall be retained - particularly\nmature trees and rare specimens. Where adequate plant material\nis absent or to be removed, a landscaped buffer consisting of two\n(2) canopy trees and two (2) understory trees per one-hundred\n(100) linear feet of property frontage shall be installed. In addition,\none upright shrub per eight (8) linear feet of property frontage\nshall also be installed.\n2.\nPermitted Structures. The following structures may be built within\nthe required buffer yard.\na.\nPedestrian or bicycle paths;\nb.\nPlanters, retaining walls, fences, park tables and seating,\nhedges, and other landscaping structures; and\nC.\nUtility lines (above or\nbelow ground), their support structures, and minor\nstructures accessory to utility lines, provided that they\ngenerally cross rather than run along the length of the\nbuffer yard.\n(D)\nMaximum Impervious Surface\nThe maximum permitted coverage by impervious surfaces shall be eighty\npercent (80%) of the total lot area.\n(E)\nParking and Loading\n1.\nParking.\na.\nLocational Requirements. No vehicular or equipment\nparking except automobile parking shall be permitted in the\nyard area adjacent to the I-140 Bypass.
