In any case where a use listed in the Table of Permitted Uses has\na number in the SR column opposite the use, the use must comply with the additional Special\nRequirements contained in this section corresponding to the Special Requirements number. For\nexample, the use \"Mobile Home Park\" has the number \"11\" in the SR column opposite the use,\ntherefore, the development of a Mobile Home Park must meet the special requirements for SR 11.\nMobile Home Park of this section.\nSR 1. Bed and Breakfast Inns\nA. The maximum number of guest bedrooms shall be five (5).\nB. The inn shall be operated by a resident manager.\nC. The use shall be located in a structure which was originally constructed as a dwelling.\nD. The use shall contain only one (1) kitchen facility. Meals served on the premises shall be only\nfor overnight guests and residents of the facility.\nE. The use of such a facility by any one patron shall be limited to no more than fifteen (15) days\nper sixty (60) day period.\nSR 2. Major Subdivions\nFor major subdivision requirements refer to chapter 10.\nA. Agricultural and Rural Conservation Subdivisions\nMajor subdivisions developed in areas identified in the Harmony Future Land Use Plan as either\nResidential-Agricultural shall require that all individual wells and houses be setback a minimum\nof 200 feet from the property line if the adjacent property is a bona-fide farm.\nB. Cluster developments\n1. Cluster Developments shall have a minimum of five (5) acres\n2. Uses shall be limited to single-family detached, semi-detached, attached, and two family\ndwellings and related accessory uses as allowed in the underlying zoning district.\n32\n\nNEW PAGE 38\n3. Density\na.\nThe maximum number of building lots or dwelling units shall not exceed that of\nthe underlying zoning district and any other special or overlay requirements. The\ndensity is determined by dividing the total square feet in the parent tract, excluding\nstreet right-of-ways, by the minimum lot size requirement for the underlying zoning\ndistrict.\nb. Cluster developments in watershed areas shall not exceed the allowed density or\nbuilt upon area for the balance of watershed as set forth in Chapter 11 of this\nOrdinance.\n4. Development Standards\na. Development in a Cluster Development shall be exempt from the minimum required\nlot width, lot size, front yard, side yard and rear yard requirements of the Schedule\nof District Regulations and from Section 3.1 and 3.2 relating to relationship of\nbuildings to lots and access to streets provided that the following development\nstandards are followed:\ni.\nAny residential lot with an on-site septic system shall meet the minimum lot\nsize required by the underlying zoning district. If off-site facilities are utilized,\nthis requirement shall be waived.\nii.\nAny cluster development which utilizes an off-site septic system shall provide\nto the Subdivision Administrator and the Iredell County Department of\nEnvironmental Health an \"Off-Site Septic System Management and\nMaintenance Plan\" which shall provide for the access, maintenance and\nupkeep of off-site systems. This plan shall be approved by the Environmental\nHealth Department before the final subdivision plat is recorded. Upon approval\nthe plan shall be recorded with the Register of Deeds at the same time as the\nsubdivision plat.\niii.\nSeptic easements shall not comprise more than fifty (50)-percent of open space.\nAll easements shall be designated on or with the final plat and recorded showing\nthe location of systems within the open space.\niv.\nA wall and roof maintenance easement (five (5) feet along one-story walls, ten\n(10) feet along two-story walls) shall be provided on the opposite side of the all\nzero setback lot line.\nV.\nFire-resistant walls shall be constructed between dwellings less than three (3)\nfeet apart.\nb. Cluster developments may include property across existing or proposed public\nstreets provided that the property is directly adjoining. Existing public streets shall\nnot count as part of the gross area of the project for determining density.\nC. Cluster developments in the Town of Harmony shall provide a twenty-five (25) foot\nvegetative buffer setback around the development that can be counted towards the\nopen space.\n33\n\nNEW PAGE 39\nd. Property containing a proposed bike or pedestrian facility shown in a plan approved\nby the County or Town Governing board must plat and reserve right-of-way for the\nfacility in the location and width recommended in the plan or negotiated to move to\nanother area per Planning Staff approval\ne. All built-upon areas shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff\nimpact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated stormwater flow.\n5. Open Space\na. In all Cluster Developments at least thirty (30) percent of the area of the overall site\nshall be set aside and dedicated as permanent open space. This shall be land that is\nnot contained in lots, in rights-of-way or parcels devoted to accommodating\nnecessary roads and utilities, or in parcels reserved for future development. Such\nopen spaces shall be conveyed to a homeowners association, public agency,\nnonprofit organization; or be placed in a permanent conservation or farmland\npreservation easement that is organized for, capable of, and willing to accept the\nresponsibility for managing the open space for its intended purpose. Where a\nproperty association is not incorporated, a maintenance agreement shall be filed\nwith the property deeds. In consideration of the purposes served by a cluster\ndevelopment, the title to such open space property shall be preserved to the\nperpetual benefit of the private properties in the development and shall be restricted\nagainst private ownership for any other purposes. If the organization desires,\nimprovements may be made within the open space provided that the maximum\ncoverage of each type of improvement shall not exceed the following:\ni.\nAboveground improvements, three (3) percent of the open space.\nii.\nLevel or below ground improvements, twenty (20) percent of the open space.\nb. Open space shall be dedicated or reserved for one or more of the following uses:\ni.\nConservation of, and avoidance of development in, any readily identifiable\nnatural hazard areas - i.e., areas that potentially pose a significant hazard to\npeople or property (e.g., designated floodways, other perennially wet lands,\nand lands whose slope and/or soils make them particularly susceptible to\nerosion when disturbed by development activities);\nii.\nConservation and protection of any identified significant natural areas (e.g.,\nrare plant communities, important wildlife habitat) or other environmentally\nsensitive areas where development might threaten water quality or\necosystems (e.g., watershed buffers, groundwater recharge areas);\niii.\nConservation and protection of any identified important historic resources\n(e.g., homesteads, mills, barns, archeological sites);\niv.\nProvision of active and/or passive outdoor recreation opportunities (e.g.,\nballfields, playgrounds, tennis courts, swimming pools, basketball courts, golf\ncourses, bikeways, walking trails, nature trails, and picnic areas), either for\n34\n", "page_number": 37, "page_range": [37, 38, 39], "highlight": ["Subdivisions\nMajor subdivisions developed in areas identified in the Harmony Future Land Use Plan as either\n<em>Residential</em>-<em>Agricultural</em>", "Septic easements shall not comprise more than fifty (50)-<em>percent</em> of open space.", "the organization desires,\nimprovements may be made within the open space provided that the maximum\n<em>coverage</em>", "Aboveground improvements, three (3) <em>percent</em> of the open space.\nii.", "Level or below ground improvements, twenty (20) <em>percent</em> of the open space.\nb."], "score": 7.376627, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Residential Agricultural\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-A\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RA\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-A\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage by impervious surfaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"impervious surface\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximumimum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max.imum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximumimum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max.imum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximumimum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max.imum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximumimum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max.imum impervious coverage\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [37, 38, 39]}
