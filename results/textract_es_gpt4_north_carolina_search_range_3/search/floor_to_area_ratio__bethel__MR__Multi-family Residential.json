If impermeable asphalt or concrete is used for the parking\nlot surface, medians, perimeter strips or islands within the parking area must be used as collectors and reservoirs\nfor stormwater run-off.

Vegetated buffer strips shall be created, or where practicable, retained in their\nnatural state along the banks of all watercourses, waterbodies, or wetlands.
