Furthermore, the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys or other public right-of-way\nfor parking or maneuvering to and from off-street parking spaces is prohibited, except where such maneuvering\nis necessary in the use of driveways for access to and from single-family and two-family dwellings.\n\u00a7 154.095 MINIMUM DIMENSIONS OF SPACES AND TRAVEL-WAYS.

Every such parking area abutting residentially zoned property\nshall be effectively screened to shield the residential property from parking lot illumination, headlights, fumes,\nblowing papers and dust; provided, however, that screening will not be required on any side which adjoins another\nsuch parking area. In addition, all areas not used for buildings, parking, maneuvering, or pedestrian walks shall\nbe landscaped.\n\u00a7 154.097 ADDITIONAL LOT PERMITTED TO MEET PARKING REQUIREMENT.\nEach application for a zoning permit shall include information as to the location and dimensions of off-street\nparking spaces, if required, and the means of ingress and egress between such space and public street or alley.\nThis information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the Code Enforcement Officer to determine whether or not\nthe requirements of this section are being met.\n\u00a7 154.098 RESERVED.\n\u00a7\n154.099 ZONING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY - PARKING\nREQUIREMENTS TO BE MET BEFORE ISSUANCE.\nA zoning permit and certificate of occupancy for any building, structure or land where off-street parking space is\nrequired shall not be issued until the requirements of this chapter have been complied with.\n\u00a7 154.100 PARKING REQUIREMENTS.\nOff-street automobile

Neither is it the intent of this subchapter to permit existing areas to be built upon or used for other\nthan parking purposes without an equivalent amount of usable parking space being provided in proximity to the\nuse involved. This replacement parking space would be over and above the additional spaces needed to\naccommodate the enlarged floor area of the establishment altered.\n\u00a7 154.091 PERMANENT OPEN SPACE REQUIRED.\nThe off-street parking space required by this section shall be permanent open space and shall not be used for any\nother purpose, except as noted above. This open space may be provided beneath, within or on top of a structure\nin addition to being located outside the structure.\n\u00a7 154.092 COMBINATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACE FOR SEPARATE
