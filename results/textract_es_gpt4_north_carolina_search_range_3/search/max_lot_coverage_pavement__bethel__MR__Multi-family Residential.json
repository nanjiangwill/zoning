Nature of District\nThe DCD is an overlay district. The requirements and provisions of the DCD shall supplement the\nrequirements and provisions of the underlying zone.\nC. Location\nThe DCD may be applied only to land located within the R-10 and RR-10 zoning districts.\nD. Size of District\nThe DCD may be applied only to parcels of land consisting of at least 5 acres.\nE. Permitted Uses\n1. Uses as permitted in the underlying zoning district.\n2.
