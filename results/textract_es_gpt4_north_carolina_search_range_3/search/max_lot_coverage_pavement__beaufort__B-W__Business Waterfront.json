These standards are\ndesigned to improve the aesthetics, traffic congestion and provide for a solid and vibrant tax\nbase as well as promote the public health, safety and welfare of the town.\nK) H-BD Historic Business District.\nPurpose: The intent of this district is to allow land and structures which provide personal\nservices, retailing, and business services compatible with the district's historic character.
