ACCESSORY APARTMENT\nAn accessory apartment shall be allowed as a SPECIAL PERMIT subject to the general standards for all Special\nPermits and the following specific standards and criteria.\n1. Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this regulation is to provide the opportunity for the creation of\nadditional housing opportunities associated with a single-family residence, especially for elderly or disabled\nfamily members. An accessory apartment shall be permitted in a manner that maintains the character and\nscale of adjoining residences and blends into the existing neighborhood.\n2. The lot shall be located in a residential zone and shall have a lot area of minimum square ft. of that zone or\ngreater. No more than one accessory apartment may be permitted on a single family residential lot.\n3. Types of accessory apartments permitted:\na. An accessory apartment may be permitted only within an existing or proposed single family\nresidence provided the exterior design plans are consistent with single family residential\nappearance.\n4. The accessory apartment shall be clearly subordinate to the single-family residence. The floor area (see\nDefinition section) of the apartment in a residence or accessory structure shall not be greater than 40\npercent of the total floor area of the residence. The apartment shall have a minimum floor area of 500\nsquare feet.\n5. An accessory apartment may be located in an accessory structure on a lot with a primary single family\nresidence provided the accessory structure meets the minimum requirements for front, side and rear yard\nsetback. The Commission may approve the conversion of an existing accessory structure for accessory\napartment use where the existing structure does not meet the yard setback requirements under the\nfollowing conditions:\ni. The lot and structure are located in R-A, R zone, and\nii. The structure has been established for a minimum of ten years.\n6. The applicant shall submit a statement from the Torrington Area Health District regarding adequacy of the\nwater supply and sewage disposal systems.\n7. A minimum total of 3 off street parking spaces shall be provided for the use of the principal residence and\naccessory apartment. The Commission may require that parking spaces for the apartment be screened\nfrom public view or located behind the residence.\n8. An accessory apartment created without the benefit of a Zoning Permit before the effective date of this\namendment, August 15, 2009, may receive a Zoning Permit issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer\nwhere the ZEO determines that:\na.\nDocumentation has been provided certifying that the owner of the lot resides on the property.\nb. Written approval of the apartment use is provided by the Regional Health District.\nC. Off-street parking as required above is provided.\n40\n\nNEW PAGE 41\nG. MULTIPLE DWELLINGS\n1. No person, partnership or corporation shall, from the effective date of this regulation, construct more than\none dwelling unit on any lot without a permit granted by the Commission. Permits are required for cluster\nhousing, condominiums, under Chapter 825 of the Connecticut General Statutes, and multiple dwellings on\na single lot.\n2. The minimum lot size for any multiple dwellings shall be determined by the criteria in TABLE 2 (page 19).\n3. Applications for a permit must comply with special permit requirements.\nRequirements for Multiple Dwellings\na. Any proposed project must have access to a public street.\nb. Any project which requires interior roads shall provide for the construction of roads that comply\nwith the standards for construction of town roads, as illustrated in figures #1 and #2 and made a\npart of this ordinance.\nC.\nAll projects shall also provide for the construction of sidewalks along each public road and along\neach road to be constructed, in accordance with figure #4 and made a part of this ordinance.\nd. All minimum site distances shall comply with figure #5, and made a part of this ordinance.\ne. Plans shall indicate that during the period of excavation, filling or removal, such barriers or fences\nshall be erected as necessary for the protection of pedestrians and vehicles.\nf.\nTruck access to the site shall be arranged as to minimize danger to traffic and nuisance to\nsurrounding properties. That portion of the access road within the site shall be maintained in such\ncondition as not to constitute a nuisance.\ng. When excavation, filling or removal operations, or any of them are completed, the disturbed area\nshall be graded so that no gradients in disturbed earth shall be steeper than a slope of three to one\n(horizontal to vertical). All debris shall be removed or buried. The area shall be seeded with a\nperennial rye grass or equally suitable vegetation and maintained until approved by the\nCommission.\nh. There will be no excavation, fill, or removal within 50 feet of any property or street line except to\nan elevation equal with or above the established grade of the adjoining street or property.\ni.\nBuildings shall be so located on the lot as to provide for the amenities of suburban living, to assure\nthe maximum of light and ventilation, to control the impact of traffic and parking on the site, and\nintegrate the development with the neighborhood.\nj.\nOff street parking spaces shall be provided in garage, carport, or parking lot on the same lot,\ntotaling not less than two spaces for each dwelling unit.\nk.\nDriveways shall be established for each unit in accordance with figure #3.\nI.\nNo units shall be constructed unless an appropriate drainage plan has been established and will not\ncreate a hazard of storm water runoff, or undue accumulation of surface water.\nm. No permit may be approved without the following:\n1) Proper provision for vehicle traffic, control of entrance from an exit to highway, and adequate\nparking.\n41\n\nNEW PAGE 42\n2) Proper provision for pedestrian traffic, including sidewalks;\n3) Proper provision for water supply, and for the disposal of storm water and sanitary sewage, in\naccordance with this ordinance and with the requirements of other departments of the town\nand the Fire District\nn. In any case where septic systems will provide inadequate for the appropriate disposal of waste, no\npermit may be granted unless appropriate provision has been made and approval been given for\nconnection to the Fire District services for septic disposal.\nO. Except for driveways giving access to public streets, all buildings, driveways and parking areas shall\nbe not less than 25 feet from the nearest property line.\np. No permit may be granted unless the land is suitable for multiple dwellings. Land subject to\nperiodic flooding, poor drainage, steep slopes, or a specific hazardous condition, shall not be\nconsidered suitable. Land with inadequate capacity for subsurface sewage disposal shall not be\nconsidered appropriate unless connected to public sewers.\nq.\nA major consideration in determining the buildability of land is the slope. Among the factors to be\nconsidered when dealing with slope conditions:\n1) Access to site - suitable and safe access to the building site must be available, for the\nmaximum allowable driveway slope of 15%.\n2) Soil conditions - the soil conditions present on the site must allow an adequate area for a septic\nsystem installation including a useable reserve septic area.\n3) Character of surrounding land - surrounding land use must be compatible with the proposed\nuse of the property.\n4) Intensity of development in area - land areas of steep slopes severely limits the intensity of\ndevelopment that can be sustained in a manner which protects the public health and safety.\n5) Relief - any proposed building with steep slopes must contain a natural area of relief providing\nfor a building site and sewage disposal area.\n6) It must be stressed that all slope considerations are to be applied to land in its natural state.\nAny drastic or extensive manmade slope provisions will not be considered an improvement\nupon or betterment of the building site's suitability. It is the express intent of this ordinance to\nprotect topographically self-preserving land, and in that way preserve land, and in that way\npreserve the natural beauty and rural character of North Canaan. The provisions of this\nregulation will be applied to land as it existed before manmade changes.\nr.\nAny deviation from any plans submitted and the above conditions shall be cause for the\nCommission to revoke the permit.\nS.\nBefore the permit is granted the applicant shall file a performance bond with the Treasurer of the\nTown of North Canaan, in a form approved by the Town Attorney, and in such amount as the\nCommission shall deem necessary to ensure compliance with the conditions set forth in Section b,\nC, I, n.\nH.
