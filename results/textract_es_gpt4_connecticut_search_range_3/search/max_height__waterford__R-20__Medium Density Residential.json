A goal of the Town's Plan of Development is to\n\"foster the preservation of the strong village identities which currently exist throughout the community\".\nThus, the Commission declares that it is in the public interest to insure that the distinctive character of a\nvillage should not be injuriously affected and that the scale of a village be maintained.\nThe criteria for classifying a community as a village residential district are as follows:\n1.\nA village is a stable residential area, generally composed of lots smaller than the 20,000 square\nfeet minimum required in the R-20 zone.\n2.\nA village functions as an entity.\n3.\nA village has an existing, identifiable character which distinguishes it from surrounding\ndevelopment, resulting from one or more factors including:\n4.\nA village was generally developed before the present zoning regulations were enacted.\n5.\nA village does not contain large tracts of undeveloped land.\n6A.2\nDESIGN OBJECTIVES\nAll development within the Village Density Residential Zone must be consistent with the following\nobjectives:\n1.\nThe pattern of development in these areas must be consistent with the present pattern of\ndevelopment and with the Plan of Development.\n2.\nThe character and quality of existing village is to be maintained; structural rehabilitation is to be\nencouraged, and the scale of the new development should be compatible with the existing\nbuildings.\n3.\nNo high intensity use or uses inconsistent with the residential character of these areas are to be\npermitted or be allowed to infringe on these villages.\n4.\nArchitectural and site design which promote aesthetic qualities while sustaining and enhancing the\nunique qualities of the Village are required, and shall be incorporated in all applications for\npermits. The Zoning Official may refer an application, which in his/her opinion is inconsistent\nwith these regulations to the Planning and Zoning Commission for action as a site plan. (Effective\n8/1/02)\n5.\nDue to the limited lot sizes permitted, proximity to coastal waters, and potential impacts on water\nquality resulting from sewage discharges, each lot shall be served by public water and sewer.\n(Effective Date: 11/28/88)\n6A.3\nMINIMUM LOT SIZE\nThe minimum lot size of a village density residential district varies and is a function of the character of the\nvillage.

A goal of the Town's Plan of Development is to\n\"foster the preservation of the strong village identities which currently exist throughout the community\".\nThus, the Commission declares that it is in the public interest to insure that the distinctive character of a\nvillage should not be injuriously affected and that the scale of a village be maintained.\nThe criteria for classifying a community as a village residential district are as follows:\n1.\nA village is a stable residential area, generally composed of lots smaller than the 20,000 square\nfeet minimum required in the R-20 zone.\n2.\nA village functions as an entity.\n3.\nA village has an existing, identifiable character which distinguishes it from surrounding\ndevelopment, resulting from one or more factors including:\n4.\nA village was generally developed before the present zoning regulations were enacted.\n5.\nA village does not contain large tracts of undeveloped land.\n6A.2\nDESIGN OBJECTIVES\nAll development within the Village Density Residential Zone must be consistent with the following\nobjectives:\n1.\nThe pattern of development in these areas must be consistent with the present pattern of\ndevelopment and with the Plan of Development.\n2.\nThe character and quality of existing village is to be maintained; structural rehabilitation is to be\nencouraged, and the scale of the new development should be compatible with the existing\nbuildings.\n3.\nNo high intensity use or uses inconsistent with the residential character of these areas are to be\npermitted or be allowed to infringe on these villages.\n4.\nArchitectural and site design which promote aesthetic qualities while sustaining and enhancing the\nunique qualities of the Village are required, and shall be incorporated in all applications for\npermits. The Zoning Official may refer an application, which in his/her opinion is inconsistent\nwith these regulations to the Planning and Zoning Commission for action as a site plan.
