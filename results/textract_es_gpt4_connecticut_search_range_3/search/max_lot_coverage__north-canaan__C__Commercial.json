Statement of Intent\nWithin the districts established by this regulation or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, uses\nand structures which were lawful before this regulation was passed or amended, but which should be prohibited,\nregulated or restricted under the terms of this regulation or future amendment.\nSuch uses are declared by this regulation to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is the\nintent of this regulation to permit these non-conformities to continue so long as they are not enlarged upon,\nexpanded or extended, if such a change increases the non-conformity, or is used as grounds for adding other\nstructures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. A change in ownership in no way affects the status of\nthe non-conforming lot, use, or structure.\nA non- conforming use of a structure, use of land or non-conforming use of a structure and land shall not be\nextended or enlarged after passage of this regulation by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs\nintended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which could be prohibited\ngenerally in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this regulation shall be deemed to require a\nchange in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction, or designated\nuse of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of the adoption of\nthis regulation.\nB.

This provision shall apply\neven though such lot fails to meet the requirements of the area or lot frontage, or both, that are generally\napplicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or frontage, or\nboth, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard\nrequirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Appeals.\nNothing in this regulation shall restrict the future construction of structures in conformance at the effective date of\nthese regulations in subdivisions in the process of approval at such effective date or in subdivisions approved prior\nto such effective date.\nC. Non-Conforming Uses of Land\nWhere, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation lawful use of land exists that is made no\nlonger permissible under the terms of this regulation as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long\nas it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:\n1. No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area\nof land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation.\n2. No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part any other portion of the lot or\nparcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation.\n3. If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than two years,\nany subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this regulation for\nthe district in which such land is located.\nD. Non-Conforming Structures\nWhere a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation that could not be\nbuilt under the terms of this regulations by reason of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other\ncharacteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains\notherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:\n1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-conformity.\n2. Should such structure be destroyed or damaged, it may be repaired or replaced to an extent which\ndoes not increase the non-conformity. If such repair or replacement is not accomplished within\ntwo years, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this regulation.\n3. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter be\nsubject to the requirements of the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is\nmoved.\nE.
