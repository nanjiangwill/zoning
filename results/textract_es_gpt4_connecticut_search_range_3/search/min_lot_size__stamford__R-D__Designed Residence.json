[LIMITATIONS TO THE CONTINUATION OF NON-CONFORMING USES]\nThe total structural repairs and alterations that may be made in a Structure which is non-\nconforming in use only shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value at the time of\napplication for the first structural change, unless changed to a conforming use. The foregoing\nprovision in this Subsection with reference to limitations on structural repairs and alterations need\nnot apply to that part of any Building used for residence purposes located in any Business or\nIndustrial District, not conforming to the SCHEDULE OF REQUIREMENTS FOR AREA,\nHEIGHT AND BULK OF BUILDINGS in APPENDIX B, except that no additional dwelling units\nshall be permitted in any such Building in which structural repairs or alterations are undertaken\nunless the density provisions of SCHEDULE OF REQUIREMENTS for minimum number of\nsquare feet of Lot Area per family can be complied with for the district in which such Building is\nlocated.\n10.C. [REBUILDING OF NON-CONFORMING USES AFTER DISASTERS]\nAny non-conforming Building or Structure or one or more of a group of non-conforming\nBuildings or Structures which has been or may be damaged by fire, flood, explosion, earthquake,\nwar, riot, act of God or act of any governmental authority, may be reconstructed and used as\nbefore, if reconstruction is started with twelve (12) months of such calamity, provided that the\nrestored Building covers no greater area or has no greater cubic content and has equal or greater\nfront, side and Rear Yards.\n10.D. [EXPIRATION OF GRANDFATHERED NON-CONFORMINGl USES]\nA Building Structure or portion thereof, non-conforming as to use, which is, or hereafter becomes\nvacant or remains unoccupied for a continuous period of one (1) year shall not thereafter be\noccupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the district in which it is\nlocated.\n10-1\n\nNEW PAGE 316\nAugust 31, 2021\n10.E. [GRANDFATHERED STATUS FOR BUILDINGS AND LOTS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO 1955]\nAny Building constructed prior to July 1, 1955, or any Plot for which a Building permit has been\nissued prior to that date having area, front, side and/or Rear Yard insufficient to comply with the\nRegulations then in effect shall nevertheless be deemed to be lawfully non-conforming with\nrespect thereto and may be continued.\n10.F. PROHIBITION OF SUBDIVISION FOR NON-CONFORMING USES IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS]\nAny Lot located within a residence district and supporting a commercial use of land or use of a\nStructure that is non-conforming with respect to the Permitted Uses of Appendix A - LAND USE\nSCHEDULE, where such non-conforming commercial use exceeds either 50% ground coverage or\na Floor Area Ratio of 0.30 of such Lot, shall not be reduced with respect to the original acreage,\nfrontage, width, or configuration of such Lot existing at the time that the use first became non-\nconforming. Such Lots may however be modified or combined with adjacent lands provided that\nthe non-conforming use shall not be expanded, intensified or extended into adjacent lands. No\nnew Permitted Uses, Structures or Buildings shall be established on any Lot supporting a use of\nland or use of a Structure that is non-conforming with respect to the Permitted Uses of Appendix\nA that would increase the degree of non-conformity or exceed the maximum intensity of use\npermitted for the district. Intensity of non-residential uses shall be equated on a residential density\nbasis of not more than 800 square feet of gross non-residential floor area per dwelling unit, or such\nlesser amount deemed appropriate based on the character of the non-residential use.

No structural change is made to the exterior of the Building except as is necessary to provide\naccess for handicapped persons, for code compliance, or for customary repair and\nmaintenance; and no increase in legally nonconforming floor area.\n2. Where the existing number and design of Parking Spaces and access thereto is legally\nnonconforming, the Zoning Board may (a) allow such nonconformities to remain, and/or (b)\napprove an alternate design that decreases the nonconformities and where the Zoning Board\nmakes a determination that the proposed plan provides for adequate parking.
