This may\ninclude the preservation of, or restriction on development within, buildable areas with\nexposed ledge, hilltops, ridges and areas of vegetation determined to be of value for\nhabitats, buffering or as an amenity to the design of the project.\n3.17.4 PROCEDURE\nIn taking action on a proposed Age Restricted Housing application, the Commission shall grant\napproval to each of the following parts of the application.\n3.17.4.1\nApplication for Special Permit including all data required under Sections 3.17.3.1,\n3.17.3.2, 3.17.3.4, 23.4 and 23.5 herein.\n3.17.4.2\nConceptual Site Plan drawings in accordance with Sections 3.17.3.2, 3.17.2.3 and\n3.17.3.5 herein which shall delineate the approved design concept described within\nthe Special Permit approval, and will establish the maximum number of units to be\n", "page_number": 40, "page_range": [40, 41, 42], "highlight": ["frontage requirement from the front property line\nto the building line.\n3.16.4 Minimum Open Space - Fifty <em>percent</em>", "a site shall be provided as permanently protected open\nspace as part of cluster subdivisions in the <em>R</em>-", "<em>20</em> District; R-40 District; and RU-120 District.\n3.16.5\nAllowable Uses in Open Space - Allowable uses", "topographic features;\nCELL (1, 1): \nHousing\nType\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum\nLot Size\nCELL (1, 3): \nMaximum\n<em>Coverage</em>", "Age Restricted Housing projects may be allowed in the <em>R</em>-<em>20</em>, R-40, and developed in RU-120\nZoning districts"], "score": 6.6100016, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Medium Density Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-20\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R20\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-20\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage by impervious surfaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"impervious surface\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximumimum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max.imum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximumimum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max.imum imperv. coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximumimum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max.imum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximumimum impervious coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max.imum impervious coverage\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]}
