Such Lots may however be modified or combined with adjacent lands provided that\nthe non-conforming use shall not be expanded, intensified or extended into adjacent lands. No\nnew Permitted Uses, Structures or Buildings shall be established on any Lot supporting a use of\nland or use of a Structure that is non-conforming with respect to the Permitted Uses of Appendix\nA that would increase the degree of non-conformity or exceed the maximum intensity of use\npermitted for the district.
