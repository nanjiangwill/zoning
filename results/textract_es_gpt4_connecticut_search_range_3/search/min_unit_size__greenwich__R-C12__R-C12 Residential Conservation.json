(b) A non-\nconforming building, lot or use, or the building in which a non-\nconforming use occurs, may not be changed, altered or added to\nexcept in accordance with the following: (1) Change A non-\nconforming building, lot or use, or the building in which a non-\nconforming use occurs may be changed to another non-conforming\nuse only if after application for Special Permit, the Commission\nfinds that said change meets the standards of Sections 6-15 and 6-17\nand also finds said changed use is not more detrimental to the\nneighborhood than the existing use. (2) Alteration or Addition A\nnon-conforming building, other than single family or two family,\nmay be altered or permitted to expand provided that such alteration\nor addition meets the standards for site plan review under Sec.6-15,\nand further provided that such alteration or expansion shall not\nincrease the degree of non-conformity. The addition of floor area\nwhich either (a) causes the floor area ratio or building coverage\npermitted in the zone to be exceeded, or (b) results in a site plan for\nall uses on the site which does not provide parking in accordance\nwith the standards of Division 15, shall be deemed to increase the\ndegree of non-conformity and shall not be permitted. Dwelling or\naccessory buildings in residential zones which have legally non-\nconforming yards, may be added to, provided the addition does not\nfurther encroach into the required yard(s) and provided that any\naddition extending horizontally beyond the limits of the building\nwill have a width not more than half of the total width of the non-\nconforming portion of the building being added to. Only (1) non-\nconforming addition may be made under the latter provision and\nconstruction permitted by variance of yard requirements may not be\ncounted in the width calculations described above. (3) A non-\nconforming lot may not be altered if the result would be to increase\nthe degree of non-conformity. (4) Damage, Destruction or\nReplacement.
