LANDSCAPING, SCREENING AND BUFFER AREAS\n941.\nBackground and Purposes\nThe following standards are intended to enhance the appearance and natural beauty of the\nTown and to protect property values through preservation of existing vegetation and\nplanting of new screening and landscaping material. Specifically, these standards are\nintended to reduce excessive heat, glare and accumulation of dust, to provide shade and\nprivacy from noise and visual intrusion and to prevent the erosion of the soil, excessive\nrunoff of storm water, and the consequent depletion of the groundwater table and the\npollution of water bodies, watercourses, wetlands and aquifers.\n942.\nGeneral Requirements\nThe following provisions shall apply to any use requiring a Special Permit or Site Plan\nApproval:\na.\nLandscaping, trees and shrubs required by these Regulations shall be planted in a\ngrowing condition according to accepted horticultural practices and they shall be\nmaintained in a healthy growing condition. Any landscaping, trees and shrubs\nwhich shall be shown on an approved Site Plan and which shall be in a condition\nthat does not fulfill the intent of these Regulations shall be replaced by the property\nowner during the next planting season for the particular plant material. Permanent\nwatering systems shall be encouraged.\nb.\nA screening fence or wall required by these Regulations shall be maintained by the\nproperty owner in good condition throughout the period of the use of the lot.\nC.\nAll landscaping, trees, shrubs and other planting material adjacent to parking areas,\nloading areas, or driveways shall be properly protected by barriers, curbs or other\nmeans to prevent damage from vehicles.\nd.\nTo the extent possible, existing trees, vegetation and unique site features such as\nstone walls shall be retained and protected during construction. Existing healthy,\nmature trees, if properly located, shall be considered in meeting the requirements of\nthese Regulations.\ne.\nWhere the Commission determines that the lot size and shape or existing structures\nshall make it infeasible to comply with the requirements for a front landscape area,\nbuffer area, or landscaped parking area, the Commission may accept alternative\nlandscaping provided it shall be necessary, reasonable and in compliance with the\nintent of these Regulations.\nf.\nIn cases where the edge of the pavement or sidewalk within the public right-of-way\nshall not coincide with the front lot line, the property owner shall plant grass and\nmaintain the area between the front lot line and the edge of street pavement or\nsidewalk.\ng.\nAll portions of non-residential properties which shall not be proposed as locations\nfor buildings, structures, off-street parking and loading areas, sidewalks or similar\nPage IX-30\n\nNEW PAGE 246\nimprovements, shall be landscaped and permanently maintained in such manner as\nto minimize stormwater runoff and harmoniously blend such non-residential uses in\nwith the residential character of the Town.\n943.\nFront Landscape Area\nThe purpose of a front landscape area is to enhance the appearance of the subject property\nand the street. The desired effect is, where appropriate, to partially screen and separate the\nuse from public view.\nFront landscape areas, where required by these Regulations, shall extend across the full\nwidth of the lot along the interior side of the front lot line, except where driveway entrances\nand exits are located, to the depth required by these Regulations. Every required landscape\narea shall be planted with trees (shade or ornamental), shrubbery and ground cover or grass.\nAs a minimum, one deciduous shade tree having a caliper of at least two and one-half inches\n(measured four feet above the root crown) and a height of eight feet shall be planted within\nthe front landscape area for each 50 feet or fraction thereof of lot frontage. The spacing of\ntrees or groups of trees shall not exceed 50 feet.\na.\nIn all Residential, NB, DB, DMR, DBR and DO Zones, every use shall have a front\nlandscape area of not less than the required front yard for that zone.\nb.\nIn the SB Zone, the front landscape area shall be 6 feet except that any property on\nBoston Post Road located east of Birch Road shall provide 18 feet (see Section 756).\nC.\nIn zones which do not require a minimum front yard (DC, CBD and PR), a front\nlandscape area may not be required, except if a front yard shall be provided, it shall\nbe landscaped.\n[Amended 8/11/2019]\n944.\nBuffer Area\nThe primary purpose of the buffer area is to provide privacy from noise, headlight glare, and\nvisual intrusion to residential dwellings. A buffer area shall be required along and within all\nboundaries of a lot abutting or directly across a local street from any lot in a Residential\nZone. Single-family dwellings shall not be required to provide a buffer. Required buffer\nareas shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet in width except as these Regulations may\notherwise permit. The buffer area shall not be used for buildings, parking, storage, refuse\ncollection, utilities, or any other use and any required planting or fencing required by the\nCommission shall be maintained and/or replaced to accomplish the intended purpose(s).\n[Amended 8/11/2019]\na.\nThe buffer area may include fencing together with evergreen planting of such type,\nheight, spacing and arrangement as, in the judgment of the Commission, shall\neffectively screen the activity on the lot from the neighboring residential area. Non-\nevergreen planting may be included to supplement evergreen planting, but not to\ntake its place.\nPage IX-31\n\nNEW PAGE 247\nb.\nA decorative wall or earthen berm of location, height, design and materials approved\nby the Commission may be used in conjunction with the required planting and/or\nbuffer area.\nC.\nWhere the existing topography and/or landscaping provides natural screening, the\nCommission may modify the planting and/or buffer area requirements.\n945. Landscaped Parking Areas\nAll parking areas shall be designed in such a manner that visual impact upon the\nsurrounding area shall be minimized. Acceptable methods may include, but not be limited\nto, the use of earthen berms, landscaping, walls, fences or other screening techniques. Street\ntrees and landscaped areas shall be incorporated within the paved areas to further minimize\nvisual impacts of such facilities. Parking areas shall comply with the following minimum\nstandards:\n945.1 Perimeter Landscaping\nFor all uses except single-family residences, a landscaped area shall be provided\nalong the perimeter of the parking area (except where the parking area is\nfunctionally integrated with an adjoining parking area on an abutting lot and the\naccessway(s) to the street). The landscaped area shall have a minimum dimension\nas per Subsection 906.6 and shall be planted with grass, shrubs, trees and other\nvegetation. It shall include at least one deciduous tree having a caliper of at least\ntwo and one-half inches (measured four feet above the root crown) and at least\neight feet in height when planted for every 50 feet along the perimeter of the\nparking area.\nWhere the Commission shall determine that the lot size and shape or that the\nexisting topography or structures make it impractical to comply with this\nlandscaping requirement, the Commission may approve modification of this\nstandard provided the intent is satisfied.\nParking areas adjoining or across the street from a Residential Zone shall comply\nwith the standards for a buffer area (Subsection 944) rather than those above.\n945.2 Open Streams\nParking, sidewalks and all paved areas shall be set back at least ten feet from any\nopen stream.

This includes restrictions on size, height, location, and number of signs\nthat may be displayed.\nUnless specifically allowed as provided within Section 934, no sign shall be established,\nconstructed, reconstructed enlarged, moved or structurally altered except in conformity\nwith these Regulations and until a sign permit, if required by this section, has been\nissued.\n932.\nCategorization of Zoning Districts\n[Amended 8/11/2019]\nFor the purposes of Section 930, zoning districts in Darien shall be categorized as\nfollows:\nPage IX-10\nCELL (1, 1): \nCategory\nCELL (1, 2): \nZoning Districts\nCELL (2, 1): \nPedestrian-Oriented\nBusiness Districts\nCELL (2, 2): \nCBD, CBD-CS, NH, NB\nCELL (3, 1): \nAutomobile-Oriented\nBusiness Districts\nCELL (3, 2): \nDC, DB, SB\nCELL (4, 1): \nOffice Districts\nCELL (4, 2): \nDO\nCELL (5, 1): \nSingle-Family\nResidential Districts\nCELL (5, 2): \nR-2, R-1, R-1/2, R-1/3, R-1/5, R-NBD\nCELL (6, 1): \nMulti-Family\nResidential Districts (1)\nCELL (6, 2): \nDMR, 3.7AH, DCR, LW\nCELL (7, 1): \nOther Districts\nCELL (7, 2): \nPR, MU\n", "page_number": 223, "page_range": [223, 224, 225], "highlight": ["Required <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> facilities shall be maintained as long as the use or\nstructure exists for", "CELL (2, 2): \nCBD, CBD-CS, NH, NB\nCELL (3, 1): \nAutomobile-Oriented\nBusiness Districts\nCELL (3, 2): \n<em>DC</em>", ", DB, SB\nCELL (4, 1): \nOffice Districts\nCELL (4, 2): \nDO\nCELL (5, 1): \n<em>Single</em>-<em>Family</em>\nResidential Districts"], "score": 13.93475, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Designed Commercial\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"DC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"DC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"DC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single family residence\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single family\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single-family\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 244\n1.\nThe sign design conforms to these Regulations and is consistent with a\nsign theme given a positive recommendation by the Architectural Review\nBoard in accordance with Section 936.B.\n2.\nThe sign:\nis replacing an existing sign (conforming or non-conforming) which is\nbeing abandoned, and\nthe new sign will be reasonably similar to the previous sign in terms of\nsize, shape, color, lighting, location, and other relevant factors even\nthough the letters and/or symbols and materials may change and/or is\nbeing made more conforming in a material way.\n3.\nThe sign conforms to these Regulations and is reasonably similar to other\nsigns on the building (or on the premises) in terms of size, shape,\nmaterials, color, lighting, location, and other relevant factors and/or is\nbeing made more conforming in a material way.\nb.\nArchitectural Review Board\nFor other signs that otherwise conform to these Regulations:\n1.\nApplication shall be made to the ZEO for initial review of compliance\nwith these Regulations and will then be referred to the Architectural\nReview Board (ARB) for review.\n2.\nUpon a favorable report by the ARB, the ZEO shall issue a permit.\n3.\nIf the ARB should give an unfavorable report, the ZEO shall then refer the\napplication to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and final\naction.\n4.\nShould the Planning and Zoning Commission approve the sign, the ZEO\nshall issue a permit.\nPage IX-29\n\nNEW PAGE 245\nSECTION 940. LANDSCAPING, SCREENING AND BUFFER AREAS\n941.\nBackground and Purposes\nThe following standards are intended to enhance the appearance and natural beauty of the\nTown and to protect property values through preservation of existing vegetation and\nplanting of new screening and landscaping material. Specifically, these standards are\nintended to reduce excessive heat, glare and accumulation of dust, to provide shade and\nprivacy from noise and visual intrusion and to prevent the erosion of the soil, excessive\nrunoff of storm water, and the consequent depletion of the groundwater table and the\npollution of water bodies, watercourses, wetlands and aquifers.\n942.\nGeneral Requirements\nThe following provisions shall apply to any use requiring a Special Permit or Site Plan\nApproval:\na.\nLandscaping, trees and shrubs required by these Regulations shall be planted in a\ngrowing condition according to accepted horticultural practices and they shall be\nmaintained in a healthy growing condition. Any landscaping, trees and shrubs\nwhich shall be shown on an approved Site Plan and which shall be in a condition\nthat does not fulfill the intent of these Regulations shall be replaced by the property\nowner during the next planting season for the particular plant material. Permanent\nwatering systems shall be encouraged.\nb.\nA screening fence or wall required by these Regulations shall be maintained by the\nproperty owner in good condition throughout the period of the use of the lot.\nC.\nAll landscaping, trees, shrubs and other planting material adjacent to parking areas,\nloading areas, or driveways shall be properly protected by barriers, curbs or other\nmeans to prevent damage from vehicles.\nd.\nTo the extent possible, existing trees, vegetation and unique site features such as\nstone walls shall be retained and protected during construction. Existing healthy,\nmature trees, if properly located, shall be considered in meeting the requirements of\nthese Regulations.\ne.\nWhere the Commission determines that the lot size and shape or existing structures\nshall make it infeasible to comply with the requirements for a front landscape area,\nbuffer area, or landscaped parking area, the Commission may accept alternative\nlandscaping provided it shall be necessary, reasonable and in compliance with the\nintent of these Regulations.\nf.\nIn cases where the edge of the pavement or sidewalk within the public right-of-way\nshall not coincide with the front lot line, the property owner shall plant grass and\nmaintain the area between the front lot line and the edge of street pavement or\nsidewalk.\ng.\nAll portions of non-residential properties which shall not be proposed as locations\nfor buildings, structures, off-street parking and loading areas, sidewalks or similar\nPage IX-30\n\nNEW PAGE 246\nimprovements, shall be landscaped and permanently maintained in such manner as\nto minimize stormwater runoff and harmoniously blend such non-residential uses in\nwith the residential character of the Town.\n943.\nFront Landscape Area\nThe purpose of a front landscape area is to enhance the appearance of the subject property\nand the street. The desired effect is, where appropriate, to partially screen and separate the\nuse from public view.\nFront landscape areas, where required by these Regulations, shall extend across the full\nwidth of the lot along the interior side of the front lot line, except where driveway entrances\nand exits are located, to the depth required by these Regulations. Every required landscape\narea shall be planted with trees (shade or ornamental), shrubbery and ground cover or grass.\nAs a minimum, one deciduous shade tree having a caliper of at least two and one-half inches\n(measured four feet above the root crown) and a height of eight feet shall be planted within\nthe front landscape area for each 50 feet or fraction thereof of lot frontage. The spacing of\ntrees or groups of trees shall not exceed 50 feet.\na.\nIn all Residential, NB, DB, DMR, DBR and DO Zones, every use shall have a front\nlandscape area of not less than the required front yard for that zone.\nb.\nIn the SB Zone, the front landscape area shall be 6 feet except that any property on\nBoston Post Road located east of Birch Road shall provide 18 feet (see Section 756).\nC.\nIn zones which do not require a minimum front yard (DC, CBD and PR), a front\nlandscape area may not be required, except if a front yard shall be provided, it shall\nbe landscaped.\n[Amended 8/11/2019]\n944.\nBuffer Area\nThe primary purpose of the buffer area is to provide privacy from noise, headlight glare, and\nvisual intrusion to residential dwellings. A buffer area shall be required along and within all\nboundaries of a lot abutting or directly across a local street from any lot in a Residential\nZone. Single-family dwellings shall not be required to provide a buffer. Required buffer\nareas shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet in width except as these Regulations may\notherwise permit. The buffer area shall not be used for buildings, parking, storage, refuse\ncollection, utilities, or any other use and any required planting or fencing required by the\nCommission shall be maintained and/or replaced to accomplish the intended purpose(s).\n[Amended 8/11/2019]\na.\nThe buffer area may include fencing together with evergreen planting of such type,\nheight, spacing and arrangement as, in the judgment of the Commission, shall\neffectively screen the activity on the lot from the neighboring residential area. Non-\nevergreen planting may be included to supplement evergreen planting, but not to\ntake its place.\nPage IX-31\n", "page_number": 244, "page_range": [244, 245, 246], "highlight": ["portions of non-residential properties which shall not be proposed as locations\nfor buildings, structures, <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "<em>parking</em> and loading areas, sidewalks or similar\nPage IX-30\n\nNEW PAGE 246\nimprovements, shall be landscaped", "In zones which do not require a minimum front yard (<em>DC</em>, CBD and PR), a front\nlandscape area may not be", "<em>Single</em>-<em>family</em> dwellings shall not be required to provide a buffer."], "score": 13.606919, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Designed Commercial\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"DC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"DC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"DC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single family residence\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single family\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"single-family\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [52, 53, 54, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 244, 245, 246, 247]}
