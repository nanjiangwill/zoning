The foregoing sentence shall not, however,\nprohibit any parcel or parcels smaller than said minimum acreage being added to, and\nqualifying for R-D District designation, with a parcel possessing such minimum acreage. The\ntotal size of any R-D District, beyond the minimum required acreage, shall be determined at\nthe discretion of the Zoning Board on an individual basis. All R-D Designed Residential\n9-1\n\nNEW PAGE 198\nAugust 31, 2021\ndistrict sites are to be comprehensively planned and developed.

(81-032; 203-04; 220-13)\nd. Maximum Building Area and Height Requirements. The maximum Building Area and\nheight requirements in the R-D Designed Residential District shall be the same as those in the\nzone in which the land was located prior to its conversion to an R-D Designed Residential\nDistrict, except that if such land is contiguous to a more restricted zone for more than twenty-\nfive percent (25%) of the total distance of its boundary lines, the requirements in such more\nrestricted zone shall be adhered to.\ne.
