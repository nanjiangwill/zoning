The boundaries of the \"Gateway Conservation\nZone\" encompass all areas adjacent to the Connecticut River as shown on the Zoning Map of\nthe Town of Old Saybrook.

Any\nuse, activity, building, structure or improvement, including those allowed by a floating zone\neligible to be established and approved in the underlying District, is bound by the prevailing\nstandards of the Gateway Conservation District.\n58.2 RIPARIAN BUFFER AREA\nWithin the Gateway Conservation Zone, the Commission establishes a riparian buffer area\nof one hundred feet (100') measured in a horizontal plane, from any point of the Coastal\nJurisdiction Line (CJL) of the Connecticut River, its tributaries or its associated wetlands or\nto the most landward extent of the tidal wetlands boundary. The most landward setback of\nthese distances is utilized to determine the riparian buffer area.\nWithin the riparian buffer area, the Commission prohibits removal, cutting or destruction\nof trees, shrubs or other native, non-invasive vegetation, except in conjunction with a non-\ncommercial tree-cutting plan; the destruction of wildlife or its habitat; the application of\npesticides or herbicides; or any other activity or use that is or has the potential for being\ndetrimental to drainage, flood control, water quality, erosion control, soil conservation,\nwildlife or the land and water areas in their natural condition.\nBefore commencement of site work on any property in the Gateway Conservation Zone that\ncontains or is adjacent to a riparian buffer area, the property owner arranges for a licensed\nLand Surveyor to locate the boundaries of the riparian buffer area with oak stakes, labeled\n\"Riparian buffer area\" with waterproof ink and tied with red flags at each change of boundary\ndirection and at every one hundred foot (100') interval on straight-aways.

If part of the riparian buffer area\nis developed, then the Commission considers the remainder as undeveloped.\nIn the developed areas, property owners must maintain trees or shrubs immediately adjacent\nto the water to avoid erosion and to enhance the scenic quality of the river scene.

Buildings in most\nneighborhoods in Old Saybrook are relatively small, built\nat a human scale and relative to one another functionally,\nwhether commercial, residential, or mixed-use. While\nthese existing relationships identify the town, there are\nmethods to maintain and strengthen the Town 's unique and\nhistoric identity as infill and redevelopment occurs. New,\nlarge-format uses especially require forethought in layout\nand design - in context with existing surroundings and for\nlong-term adaptability to future changes in use.\n68.1 NEIGHBORHOOD PATTERN\nAny new development or any redevelopment, excluding any\nsingle-family residential use on a lot, will not only reinforce\nthe desirable pattern of the existing neighborhood but will\nalso complement and enhance through the following guiding\nprinciples:\n68.1.1 Guiding Principles\nA. Implementation of town plans. Old Saybrook\nplans for use of the town's land in corresponding\nstrategies - the first being long-range planning\nvia implementation of the Plan of Conservation\n& Development and its supplements (Sidewalk\nPlan, Coastal Management Plan, Open Space\nStewardship Plan, etc.), which is \"proactive\" to\nmunicipal needs, and the second being current\nreview for consistency with Town plans\nplanning via regulation of property owners'\nsite-specific initiatives, which is \"reactive\" to market\nforces. Integrated master planning funnels top-level,\nconsensus-based goals, supported by a series of policies\nthat reflect time-tested preferences in practice, into a\nspecific set of action items - municipal improvements,\nprograms, standards - which are then implemented by\nmeasurable or verifiable criteria for decision-making.\nZONING REGULATIONS\n"}, {"page": "278", "text": "NEIGHBORHOOD PATTERN & BUILDING DESIGN\nTherefore, in any development, it is incumbent upon both the\nTown and the applicant to honor years of hard work by elected\nand appointed leaders to effectively articulate \"Old Saybrook\"\nas a place in an effort to comprehensively protect the integrity\nof its built and natural environments.\nB. Sustainable development. Old Saybrook maintains a\nframework of smart growth principles inherent to its overall\ncomprehensive plan of zoning. Such opportunity for sustainable\nview of Lynde and Saybrook Points\ndevelopment protects and enhances the overall health, natural\nenvironment, and quality of life of the community. Therefore, in\nany development, both the neighborhood pattern and building\ndesign should result in efficient use, reuse and recycling of\nresources, including energy, water and construction materials.\nC. Compact development. Old Saybrook has diverse density\nof development much of which is compact due to the natural\nresources surrounding many cottages or small houses on\nsmaller building lots, planned residential developments, open\nspace subdivisions, as well as apartments that are accessory\nto existing single-family homes. Compact development results\nin more efficient use of land, reduced dependency on vehicles\nneighbors to The Back River\nfor travel, and lower costs of providing public infrastructure\nand services. Therefore, in any development, similar density\nof development should conserve natural resources and\nincorporate a variety of building forms including multifamily\nbuildings, and mixed-use development.\nD. Multiple modes of transportation. Old Saybrook is one of\nseveral \"hubs\" of transportation along the shoreline. Multiple\nmodes of transportation provide an interconnected network of\ncirculation systems that facilitate walking, bicycling and driving.\nTherefore, in any development,\nstreets should be designed to establish\na satisfactory level of service for\nvehicular travel, and promote the\nSaybrook Junction and Estuary Transit District\nsafe and efficient use of alternative\ntransportation modes.\nE.

Old Saybrook is most dynamic at those\nfocal points where dwelling units exist above, adjacent to\nor within walking distance of commercial uses, such as\nshops or offices.
