Site design BMPs are techniques and facilities\nthat can be used to reduce the quantity of runoff, and to treat runoff in order to reduce the level of\npollutants. Preferred site design techniques include minimizing impervious areas and retaining\nnative vegetation. Site design BMPs include roof downspout infiltration systems, drywells and the\nutilization of pervious surfaces where appropriate. Preferably, runoff storage and treatment\nmeasures shall be spread throughout the site rather than being placed at a single stormwater\ncollection point (end-of-pipe structure).\nLow Impact Development (LID). A site design strategy intended to maintain or replicate pre-\ndevelopment hydrology through the use of small-scale controls integrated throughout the site to\nmanage runoff as close to its source as possible. This involves strategic placement of lot-level\ncontrols to reduce runoff volume and pollutant loads through infiltration, evapotranspiration, and\nreuse of stormwater runoff. Small-scale LID practices include, but are not limited to, the use of\nvegetated swales, buffers, and filter strips, bioretention facilities and rain gardens, dry wells, sub-\nsurface chambers, and infiltration trenches, rainwater harvesting, vegetated roof covers (green\nroofs), and pervious surfaces. The main feature that distinguishes these practices from conven-\ntional structural stormwater controls is scale.

"text": "11. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS\n11.1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSE\nA.\nSTATUTORY AUTHORIZATION\nThe Legislature of the State of Connecticut has delegated in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7-\n148(c)(7)(A), and in Title 8, Chapter 124, Section 8-2 of the General Statutes the responsibility for\nlocal governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare of its citizenry. In response to the delegation of this trust, the Planning and\nZoning Commission of the Town of Ridgefield amended and updated its regulation for\nmanagement of development in floodplain areas, in accordance with the requirements of the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State of Connecticut, to secure the\nsafety of its residents from floods.\nB.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. The flood hazard areas of the Town of Ridgefield are subject to periodic flood inundation\nwhich can result in the loss of life and property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the\ndisruption of commerce and governmental services, the necessity for extraordinary public\nexpenditures for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base, all of which\nadversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains\ncausing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas\nby uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-\nproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of\nthe floodplains can adversely affect the community.\n3. The Planning and Zoning Commission first regulated development in areas designated as\n\"Flood Safety Zones\" under zoning regulations adopted effective July 12, 1968, for flood\nareas shown on maps prepared by the State of Connecticut Water Resources Commission.\nThe zoning regulations were amended in 1983 to incorporate reference to Flood Insurance\nRate Maps (FIRMs) dated September 30, 1982 and a Flood Insurance Study dated March\n30, 1982 (prepared by FEMA). The Town of Ridgefield has voluntarily participated in the\nNational Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) since September 30, 1982, and adopted \"Flood\nDamage Prevention Regulations\" effective on July 2, 1982, to meet the strictest FEMA\n(federal) requirements at that time. This Section, adopted by the Commission effective on\nApril 30, 2010, amends and updates all previous flood plain management regulations.\n4. The NFIP is founded on mutual agreements between the federal government and individual\nparticipating communities. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and\nresponsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP, and the community's role is of\nparamount importance. Property owners are able to receive federally subsidized flood\ninsurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations\nrequired for participation in the NFIP.\nC.\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development in Special Flood Hazard\nAreas (SFHAs), to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public\nand private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\n1. Protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;\n11 - 1\n"}, {"page": "234", "text": "2. Minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;\n3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;\n5. Minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas mains,\nelectric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the floodplain;\n6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nhazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage, and future flood blight areas;\n7.\nInsure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;\n8. Prevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts\nbetween property owners;\n9. Ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions;\nand\n10. Discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the\nactivity, use, or structure outside of the floodplain.\nD.\nOBJECTIVES\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes objectives, methods and provisions\nthat:\n1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or\nerosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or\nvelocities;\n2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers\nthat are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood\ndamage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert\nflood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n11.2 DEFINITIONS\nUnless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this regulation shall have the same\nmeaning as they have in common usage and to give this regulation its most reasonable\napplication.
