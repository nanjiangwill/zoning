With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation\nwill be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be\ndistributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new\npages and deleting the obsolete pages.\nKeeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As\nrevised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments\ninserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such\namendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all\ndeleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\nAcknowledgments\nThis publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice-President, and Jodi Hunt, Editor,\nof the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.
