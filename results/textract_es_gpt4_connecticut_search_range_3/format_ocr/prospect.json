If\nthere is no contiguous land to prevent the existence of a nonconformity, then\nbuildings and structures which are nonconforming or are on nonconforming lots\nmay be erected, altered, enlarged, maintained, replaced or rebuilt in accordance\nwith sections 2.4.2.1 through 2.4.2.3 below. Such erection, alteration,\nenlargement, maintenance, replacement or rebuilding may be carried out as a\nmatter of right and does not require a variance, although the requirements of\nZoning Permits apply equally to such activities as they would if such activities\nwere proposed for a conforming lot or structure.\n34\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "2.4.2.1 Nonconformity of Yards, Minimum Floor Area and Height\nAny building or structure in which a conforming use is conducted and which has\nbeen made nonconforming as to front, side or rear yard dimensions, height or\nminimum floor area by virtue of these Regulations or the amendments thereto\nmay be enlarged, altered, maintained, replaced or rebuilt notwithstanding any\nsuch nonconformity, provided that such action shall not increase the degree of\nsaid nonconformity, that said building shall comply with all the other provisions\nof these Regulations for the zone in which it lies, and, where yards are\ninvolved, that the lot on which the building or structure is located has not been\nreduced in size since the adoption of zoning regulations so as to cause or\nincrease the nonconformity due to the regulations applicable at the time of the\nreduction.\n2.4.2.2 Nonconformity as to Lot Area, Width, Minimum Buildable Area and\nMinimum Square\nNonconformity of any improved or unimproved lot with the provisions of these\nRegulations concerning minimum lot area, minimum frontage, minimum\nbuildable area in residential zones or minimum square in the Commerce Park\n(CP) zone shall not prevent the erection, enlargement, alteration, maintenance,\nreplacement or rebuilding on such lot of a building or structure which as so\nerected, enlarged, altered, maintained, replaced or rebuilt shall comply with all\nof the other provisions of these Regulations for the zone in which it lies,\nprovided that the nonconformity was not self-created, i.e. that the\nnonconformity did not result from a sale or transfer of contiguous land which\nmade the lot nonconforming (or increased the nonconformity) as to area,\nfrontage, minimum buildable area or minimum square requirements in effect on\nthe date that the sale or transfer was made.\n2.4.2.3 Nonconformity of Approved Subdivision Lot\nNonconformity of any lot as to minimum lot area, minimum width at the front lot\nline, minimum buildable area or minimum square contained in a subdivision\napproved by the Prospect Planning and Zoning Commission prior to February\n23, 1977, shall not prevent the erection, enlargement, alteration, maintenance,\nreplacement or rebuilding on such lot of a building or structure which, as so\nerected, enlarged, altered, maintained, replaced or rebuilt shall comply with all\nof the other provisions of these Regulations for the zone in which it lies. (This\nsection shall apply even when the same owner owns or controls an adjoining lot\nin 'such subdivision.)\n2.4.3 Change in Use\nNo lot on which a nonconforming use has been conducted shall be used for any\nother use that does not conform to the requirements of these Regulations unless\nsuch new use could be considered more conforming to these Regulations than\nthe nonconforming use already existing.\n35\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "2.4.4 Expansion of Nonconforming Structure\nNo nonconforming structure shall be expanded above the level at which such\nstructure existed on the date on which it became nonconforming by virtue of\nthese Regulations.

If the owner of said premises desires to resume said presumptively\nabandoned nonconforming use, he may apply to the Planning & Zoning\nCommission which shall conduct a hearing and determine whether or not said\nnonconforming use was abandoned. The burden of proof shall be upon the\napplicant to show that the use was not in fact abandoned.\nSection 2.5 Wetlands\nWhenever a zoning or Special Permit is sought for use of land designated as inland\nwetlands, approval of the activity by the Prospect Inland Wetlands Commission shall be\nrequired prior to or concurrently with the granting of the zoning or Special Permit\nrequested. Where action on such a zoning or Special Permit is required by a certain\ndate and approval by the Prospect Inland Wetlands Commission has not been obtained\nby that date, failure to have such approval shall be grounds for denial of the zoning or\nSpecial Permit.\n36\n"}, {"page": "38", "text": "ARTICLE 3\nDISTRICT REGULATIONS\nSection 3.1 Uses By District\nThe uses listed in the following schedule are permitted or prohibited in the various\ndistricts in accordance with the following designations or procedures.
