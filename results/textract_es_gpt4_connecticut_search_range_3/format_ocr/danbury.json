Sites should be chosen which can be developed\nin a manner compatible with adjacent residential development.\n(b) Sites should be adjacent to collector or arterial streets and highways, with consideration given to the\nimpact of such development on traffic safety and congestion on abutting and nearby roads and the\nfeasibility of undertaking improvements as may be necessary to limit such impacts to acceptable\nlevels.\n(c) Sites should be limited to those which are or will be served by public sewer and water service and\nwhere adequate capacity will be available for the uses allowed in the proposed zone.\n(d) Development of slopes in excess of 15 percent should be avoided.\n(e) Sites which contain a preponderance of wetlands and sites which lie within public water supply\nwatersheds should be avoided.\n10-23\n"}, {"page": "243", "text": "(3) Highway Commercial Districts.\n(a) Consideration should be given to the ability to buffer commercial development from adjacent\nresidential areas and to avoid the necessity of routing vehicular traffic to the site through\nneighborhoods.\n(b) Sites should be adjacent to collector or arterial streets and highways, with consideration given to the\nimpact of such development on traffic safety and congestion on abutting and nearby roads and the\nfeasibility of undertaking improvements as may be necessary to limit such impacts to acceptable\nlevels.\n(c) Sites should be limited to those which are or will be served by public sewer and water service and\nwhere adequate capacity will be available for the uses allowed in the proposed zone.\n(d) Development of slopes in excess of 15 percent should be avoided.\n(e) Sites which contain a preponderance of wetlands and sites which lie within public water supply\nwatersheds should be avoided.\n(4) Central Business District.\n(a) The CBD should remain compact to facilitate pedestrian access and to encourage the clustering of\nretail and commercial activity to reinforce their mutual support.\n(b) Convenient access to adequate parking and transit service should be available.\n(5) Industrial Districts.\n(a) Consideration should be given to the ability to buffer industrial development from adjacent\nresidential areas and to avoid the necessity of routing vehicular access to the site through\nneighborhoods.\n(b)\nSites should be conveniently accessible to arterial streets and highways and transit routes, with\nconsideration given to the impact of such development on traffic safety and congestion on abutting\nand nearby roads and the feasibility of undertaking improvements as may be necessary to limit such\nimpacts to acceptable levels.\n(c)\nSites should be limited to those which are or will be served by public sewer and water service and\nwhere adequate capacity will be available for the uses allowed in the proposed zone.\n(d) Development of slopes in excess of 15 percent should be avoided.\n(e) Sites which contain a preponderance of wetlands and sites which lie within public water supply\nwatersheds should be avoided.\n(f) Consideration should be given to the impact, if any, on adjacent property from smoke, noise, odor,\nand vibration which may reasonably be expected to emanate from a proposed industrial use.\n10.1.4.

The chief zoning official\nof a municipality shall report, in writing, any zoning changes adopted by the municipality\nregarding cannabis establishments pursuant to this subsection to the Secretary of the Office of\nPolicy and Management and to the department not later than fourteen days after the adoption of\nsuch changes.\nSection 148(c) of RERACA provides:\n(c) Unless otherwise provided for by a municipality through its zoning regulations or ordinances, a\ncannabis establishment shall be zoned as if for any other similar use, other than a cannabis\nestablishment, would be zoned.\nSection 148(e) of RERACA provides that until June 30, 2024, no municipality shall grant zoning approval\nfor more retailers or multi-cultivators than a number that would allow for one retailer and one micro-\ncultivator for every twenty-five thousand residents of such municipality, as determined by the most recent\ndecennial census.\nIn order for the Zoning Commission to properly evaluate RERACA and to consider the adoption of\namendments to the Zoning Regulations of the City of Danbury for local control of these uses, with a goal of\nmaintaining and protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the community, a\nmoratorium on the acceptance of any application, amendment, petition or permit for or relating to the uses\nor establishments described above is proposed.\nThe complexity of RERACA and the controls adopted therein to carefully regulate these uses at the state\nlevel supports the premise that such uses also should be carefully controlled at the local level.
