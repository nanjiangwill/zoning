Commercial buildings nearest the center of town which front on\nMain Street have moderately-sized plate glass windows. Where structures exist further back from\nthe street, many have front lawns with mature plantings; porches are common. Narrow\ndriveways often exist within side setbacks and, for the most part, garages are located to the rear.\nProperties in the VCD are served by public water and sewer. The regulations are designed to\nenhance this district as a commercial and residential area in which pedestrian traffic is\nencouraged and facilitated.\n4.9\nGENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (GCD). The primary purpose of this district is to permit the\nlogical development of land for general commercial uses designed to meet the daily needs of\nDeep River residents and to assure the suitable development of such businesses in order to\nprotect the surrounding environment. Development in the GCD District should strive to be\nconsistent with and enhance existing character, scale and development patterns. Development\nshould be planned to protect the public health and to avoid degradation of groundwater\nresources while at the same time minimize the need for structural solutions for sewerage\ntreatment and future sewer expansion.\n4.10\nVILLAGE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (VID). This district is intended to provide for continuation of\nindustrial activity on land within the village area, in order to maintain the existing village\ncharacter. Existing industrial buildings are to be preserved wherever possible, and new industrial\ndevelopment shall be compatible in size and appearance with neighboring developments and\nuses. Development in the VID District should strive to be consistent with and enhance existing\ncharacter, scale and development patterns.

The purpose of this District is to provide for\ndevelopment of commercial and industrial facilities which are compatible with the rural character\nof the surrounding area. Appropriate facilities in character with the area will include low building\nsilhouettes, with careful attention to landscaping and buffer areas. This is an appropriate location\nfor uses requiring significant outside storage areas and staging yards, provided such activity is\nwell-screened. All development must conform to strict water pollution control and aquifer\nprotection standards to avoid contamination of nearby ground and surface water resources.\nDevelopment in the CIPD District should strive to be consistent with and enhance existing\ncharacter, scale and development patterns.

This section establishes those standards and criteria that shall be\napplied in addition to those required elsewhere in these Regulations, and shall not in any way be\nconstrued to permit the expansion of any non-conforming use.\nThe Deep River Planning and Zoning Commission, in an effort to clarify the intent of Sections 7A\nand 7B of the Zoning Regulations, finds that the Special Standards attached to specific zoning\ndistricts and specific uses are an integral component of the regulations and are intended to further\nrestrict those districts and uses as deemed appropriate by the Commission. As such, they are not\nsubject to variance by the Zoning Board of Appeals as noted in Section 16.4 of the Deep River\nZoning Regulations and Section 8-6 of the Connecticut General Statutes.\nThese standards are in addition to any use-specific standards contained in Section 7B of these\nRegulations.

Building setbacks from the street, side setbacks from adjacent buildings, and\norientation of the axis of buildings shall be consistent with and recognize the rhythm, spacing and\norientation of other adjacent buildings. The primary visual focus of the site shall be the front yard\narea and front building fa\u00e7ade. Where possible, off-street parking shall be located in side and rear\nyards only, and shared parking areas may be established for adjacent lots. Each site shall be\ndesigned to encourage pedestrian use along the street fronting the site, and non-residential uses\nshall be designed to facilitate pedestrian movement within each site.\n(2)\nBuilding Form and Materials.

Substantial alterations include any modification to a structure which changes\nthe outer envelope of a structure as seen from a public street or right-of-way. This would include the\nremoval or demolition of all or part of an existing structure. In addition, a substantial alteration can\nbe any modification to a structure or its fa\u00e7ade that is determined to be such that the proposed\nmodification could render the structure incompatible with its surroundings from a design sense.\n(4) New Construction.

These Regulations are intended to insure that new development or\nredevelopment of land or modification of buildings within the Districts is consistent and compatible with\nexisting streetscape character and consistent with the following:\n(1) Maintain the existing village scale by discouraging buildings which are noticeably larger than, or out\nof character with, the residential scale buildings which predominate the streetscape;\n(2) Preserve the historic and significant structures within the Districts;\n46\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "(3) Promote the Districts as attractive commercial/residential areas which encourage pedestrian activity\nand movement.\n(4) Promote and retain a mix of commercial and residential uses in the Districts.\n(5) Buffer areas surrounding the Districts from commercial activities that might cause diminution of\nvalues or quality of residential life.\n(6) Encourage non-repetitive structure and designs.\n7A.5.4 VILLAGE DISTRICTS OVERVIEW.\nWithin the area of the three Village Districts, many of the buildings - especially on Main Street - at one\ntime included both commercial and residential uses. Many today still do. Two-story, residentially-scaled\nstructures predominate and open porches are common. Front yard setbacks vary, but most are minimal\nwith close access to pedestrian traffic, and walkways and crosswalks encourage pedestrian activity.\nMature trees, especially on the side streets off Main Street, provide shade to the landscape. Structures\nare predominantly wood clapboard siding with brick chimneys and shingled peaked roofs. Windows are\nprimarily double-hung with separate panes or lights and large plate glass windows without mullions are\nrare. Shutters are a common element and there are facades without these features.\nIn the Village Commercial District (VCD), homes date from late 1700's to the present. Small (10,000 sq.\nft) narrow lots and structures with little or no side setbacks exist. Within close proximity to Elm and\nRiver Streets in the center of town, structures are \"built to\" the sidewalk. As one moves away from that\ncentral intersection, structures are located further and further back from the street and have more and\nmore space between structures. Commercial buildings nearest the center of town which front on Main\nStreet have moderately-sized plate glass windows. Where structures exist further back from the street,\nmany have front lawns with mature plantings; porches are common. Narrow driveways often exist within\nside setbacks and, for the most part, garages are located to the rear. Properties in the VCD are served by\npublic water and sewer.\nIn the Village Residential District (VRD), numerous period structures exist and should be preserved by\nallowing limited mixed uses. Lot sizes are similar to those in the Village Commercial District that are\nlocated away from the village's primary intersection at Main Street and Elm/River Street. Clapboard-style\nsiding and shutters, brick chimneys, porches and shingled peaked roofs prevail. Window styles vary from\n2-over-2 to 16-over-16 double-hung sash. Front lawns are limited but where existing have mature\nplantings and large shade trees. Properties are served by public water and sewer.\nThe Village Mixed-Use District (VMUD), being a transition district between the Village Commercial and\nVillage Residential Districts, contains elements of both and serves to buffer the residential areas from\nthe commercial.\n7A.5.5 BOUNDARIES. The boundaries of the Village Commercial (VCD), Village Mixed-Use (VMUD) and\nVillage Residential (VRD) Districts are hereby established to be those shown on a map entitled\n\"Village Districts of the Town of Deep River, Connecticut\", dated November 1, 2011, as may be\namended.\n7A.5.6 APPLICABILITY.\nA.

A use existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations will be maintained in\nconformance with these parking standards to the extent that it conforms at the time of adoption\nof this section. If any existing use of land, buildings, or other structure is changed to a use\nrequiring additional off-street parking and loading under these Regulations, additional required\nspaced are to be provided for the new use. An existing use which does not conform to the\nstandards of this section may not be changed to a use which would require additional off-street\nparking and loading spaces to conform, unless those additional spaces are provided. An extension\nor enlargement of a non-conforming building or use will require compliance with this section.\n11.2 NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES.\nIt is the intent of these regulations that all structures and land uses be provided with a sufficient\namount of off-street motor vehicle parking, while allowing for some flexibility of site design to\naccommodate the unique characteristics of individual properties. These regulations and parking\nguidelines are designed to minimize impervious surfaces and to prevent construction of large\nblacktopped parking lots recognizing that in doing so customers and employees may not always\nbe able to park directly in front of or adjacent to every place of business.\n11.2.1 The Commission may require the submission of a parking demand analysis as part of any\napplication.\n11.2.2\nThe Commission shall consider the nature of the development, its location or other unique\nfeatures relative to the category of use, not relative to the individual occupant.\n11.2.3 The Commission may approve parking lots with more spaces than the allowed maximum provided\nall of the spaces above the maximum number are composed of a pervious surface, and where\nadequate stormwater management is provided as specified in these Regulations. The Commission\nmay also approve parking lots with impervious parking spaces above the allowed maximum where\nthe use of pervious spaces would not be environmentally sound and where a stormwater\nmanagement plan is included with the application and implemented, employing, at a minimum,\nthe stormwater management measures specified in these Regulations.\n102\n"}, {"page": "103", "text": "103\nCELL (1, 1): \n11.2.4 SCHEDULE OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS\nRequirements are based on Gross Floor Area (GFA)\nunless otherwise noted.

The soil\nsurvey provides information on the location and characteristics of various kinds of soils\nwithin the county. Areas of similar soils are delineated on aerial photographs. The soils\nand their associated landscapes are described in the text.\nThe survey report also contains interpretations or ratings of the soils for various land\nuses. The interpretations are based on the soil properties that affect the intended use.\nThe interpretations are dynamic. They must be periodically revised to reflect improved\nsoils data, new technology, and the needs of the soil survey report users.\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this document is to update and expand the interpretations for septic tank\nabsorption fields in the Middlesex County soil survey report. These updated\ninterpretations are in the form of soil potentials. Soil potentials are interpretive ratings\nthat stress the suitability of use rather than the avoidance of problems for a septic\npurpose.\nThe interpretations in this report deal only with a soils potential for septic tank absorption\nfields and does not address the use of soils for other purposes.\nThe information presented here will be useful to groups or individuals involved with\nurban development such as local officials, builders, engineers, realtors, home buyers, and\nother decision makers. The soil potential ratings may be used to predict the kinds and\nseriousness of problems that may be encountered when installing a septic tank absorption\nfield as well as possible ways these problems can be overcome.\nThese soil potential ratings were developed for planning purposes and are not intended as\nrecommendations for soil use. They help the users determine the relative suitability of\nsoils for the septic tank absorption fields. The special requirements identified to\novercome soil problems are a guide to planning and are not to be applied at a specific\nlocation without on-site investigation for design and installation.\nSOIL POTENTIAL RATINGS\nSoil potential ratings are classed that indicate the relative quality of a soil for a particular\nuse compared to other soils in a given area. Because comparisons are made only among\nsoils in Middlesex County, ratings of a given soil in a in another county may differ.\nThe rating criteria were developed by a committee of local sanitarians, engineers and\ninstallers. The soils information was provided by Soil Conservation Service soil\nscientists.\n164\n"}, {"page": "165", "text": "The soil potential ratings and associated cost factors are defined as follows:\nVery high potential. These soils have the best combination of characteristics for septic\ntank absorption fields. An engineer's design is not required. The cost factor is lx.\nHigh potential. The soils have limitations which can be easily overcome using standard\ninstallation practices. An engineer's design is required in most cases. The cost factor\nranges from I .5x to 2.Ox.\nMedium potential. These soils have significant limitations that are generally overcome\nusing commonly applied designs. The cost factors range from 2.Ox to 2.5x.\nLow potential. These soils have limitations which require extensive design and site\npreparation to overcome. These soils are commonly used for septic tank absorption fields\nin this area. The cost factor ranges from 2.5x to 3.5x.\nVery low potential. These soils have severe limitations which require extensive design\nand site preparation to overcome. These soils are rarely used for septic tank absorption\nfields in this area. The cost factor ranges from 4.25x to 6.Ox.\nExtremely low potential. These soils have severe limitations which are extremely\ndifficult to overcome. A permit for absorption field installation cannot be issued unless\nthe naturally occurring soils meet the minimal requirements outlines in the state health\ncode. It is unlikely that these soils can be improved sufficiently to meet state health code\nregulations.\nNot rated. Areas labeled \"NOT RATED\" have characteristics that show extreme\nvariability from one location to another. The work needed to overcome adverse soil\nproperties cannot be estimated without on-site investigation.\nSOIL POTENTIAL RATINGS BY MAP UNIT\nThe Soil Survey Report of Middlesex County, Connecticut, identifies and displays the\ndominant soils in the county. This data is on maps having a photographic background.\nThe symbols on the maps identify map units. Each map unit symbol represents a unique\ncombination of soils. Areas with the same symbol have the same composition.\nThe soil survey report does not replace on-site investigation. The report identifies the\nprobability of finding a particular soil or combination of soils.\nThe maps in the soil survey report are at a scale of 1:15,840. At this scale, areas\nof contrasting soils smaller than 2.5 acres in size are generally not delineated.\n165\n"}, {"page": "166", "text": "Maps enlarged from the soil survey report do not provide more detailed soils\ninformation. More detailed information can only be obtained through on-site\ninvestigations. These investigations may significantly refine the data shown in\nthe published soil survey.\nTable I assigns a potential rating to each map unit. The list of map units are in\nalphabetical order. The potential rating is based on the ease of ~istalling a septic tank\nabsorption field in the dominant soil(s) of the map unit.\nThe majority of the map units are composed of one dominant soil or of several soils with\nsimilar characteristics. A single potential rating is listed for these map units. Other map\nunits are composed of two kinds of contracting soils. In these cases, an overall potential\nrating is listed for the map unit, followed by ratings for the individual soil components\nthat make up that map unit. The Soil Survey of Middlesex County, Connecticut, should\nbe consulted for additional information concerning map unit composition.\nThe limiting soil charactenstics for each map unit are identified in the column labeled\nCONCERNS. The special design or construction practices that may be required on a site\nare listed in the column labeled CORRECTIVE MEASURES. The term corrective\nmeasures is defined on Page A-5.\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS are practices and site specific land evaluations that\nmay be needed before selecting a leach field site. These additional considerations do not\nalleviate soil problems. Instead, they may be needed to identify and determine the extent\nof limiting soil or landscape features, allow for the installation of a system, or determine\nthe most practical solution for a soil problem.\nTable 1 also identifies the state regulations which may be applicable if particular soil\nfeatures are present on the site.

All road locations, including alternate routes where advisable, will be\nplanned prior to harvesting operations.\nOutstanding considerations are:\n1. Location so as to minimize construction or use impact on the land.\n2. Grades in excess of ten percent (10%), or zero percent (0%) gradients will be\navoided except for short distances.\n3. For each road, landing or skid trail, drainage control systems or stabilization\nshall be provided and maintained to control water flow.\n4. Unless otherwise stipulated, all roads, main skid trails, landings and sawmill\nsites will be stabilized. Temporary culverts will be removed, water bars\ninstalled where necessary, ruts filled or graded out and gutters cleaned.\n5.

Slash:\n(a) No slash will be left within twenty five (25) feet of any automobile\nroad, established recreation trail, pond, lake or stream.\n(b) Within the remaining width or a border strip, all slash will be chipped\nor lopped and scattered so that it does not exceed four (4) feet in\nheight.\n(c) On all other harvest areas, slash, severely bent, or broken trees shall be\ndropped and/or lopped to a height not to exceed six (6) feet.\nIV.\nHARVEST METHODS\nBecause of the wide variation in forest types, stand size classes, stocking levels\nand timber volumes which in exist in Connecticut woodlands, there are a variety of\nmethods that can be used either singly or in combination in harvesting and reforestation\nto meet the stated purpose. These methods include clear-cutting with natural\nreproduction; direct seeding or planting: seed tree cutting; selection curring, including\ndiameter limit harvesting, shelterwood cutting, and such other methods as shall be\nconsistent with good forestry practice.\nAlthough even-age management is an accepted silvicultural practice, particularly\nwith hardwood species, it use should be practiced judiciously. A clear-cut area presents a\nsevere visual impact to those unfamiliar with this harvest method. Therefore, clear-\ncutting will have the following restrictions:\n1. Maximum of five (5) acres in size.\n2. Irregular in shape - avoid linear cutting bounds.\n3. Soften edges by partial cutting within 50 - 100 feet of clear-cut boundaries.\n4. Screen clear-cut areas with border strips along roads, trails or other areas of\nheavy public use.\n5. Leave ridge tops uncut - these areas are the most visible.\n177\n"}, {"page": "178", "text": "6. In most cases, even-aged management may be accomplished through\nshelterwood cuttings rather than clear-cutting.\nV.\nWILDLIFE CONSIDERATIONS\nVirtually any cutting in forested areas will provide wildlife benefits. Emphasis\nwill be placed on creating the maximum edge effect, and maintaining as much browse\nand cover as possible, consistent with over-all management goals.\nVL\nREGENERATION\nHarvest procedures, properly applied and executed, should provide for adequate\ntree reproduction. However, there will be instances where regeneration may be deficient\nor undesirable tree species. In these cases, steps should be taken to provide the desired\nstocking.\nVII.\nFIRE CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS\nAccess roads and fire lanes will be left clear of slash when a cutting job is\ncomplete. Designated roads will be graded so as to be passable by fire suppression\nequipment.\nWhere access road construction is included in a harvest operation, considerations\nshould be given to construction of loading docks and fire water-holes at strategic\nlocations.\n178\n"}], "town": "deep-river"}
