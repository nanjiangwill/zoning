To provide cost-efficient alternative work space that will provide an incentive for\nentrepreneurs, business owners, artists, artisans, and other individuals to continue to\nwork in Stafford and contribute to the revitalization of older commercial buildings\nand sites;\n3. To promote the preservation and reuse of commercial or industrial buildings that\ncontribute to the historic character of the community;\n4.

Applicability\n1. Work/live occupancies are only allowed in existing buildings that are proven to be\ninadequate for other practical commercial, or business uses. Such proof may be\nestablished by lack of ability to sell or rent for other commercial or business uses.\n2. Work/live occupancies are a floating district that may be allowed, at the discretion of\nthe commission, in any zoning district. In determining the applicability of any\nproposal for a work/live occupancy, the commission will consider the purposes,\nstandards, and requirements as described in this section 5.6(A). The commission will\nalso consider the impact of such proposal to surrounding property values and the\neffect on public health, safety, and welfare.\nC. Definitions\n1.

The Village Overlay District is to be interpreted as a design framework aimed\nat protecting, maintaining, and enhancing the character of the designated village centers.\nTherefore, the regulatory provisions of the Village Overlay District shall not be\ninterpreted as rigid regulatory requirements that must be met, but as a framework and set\nof recommendations to elevate standards for design and quality of investment, while\nprotecting, maintaining, and enhancing the character of Stafford's unique villages.\nTherefore, the design standards set forth in the Village District Overlay District establish\nan expectation for greater attention to design and high-quality design that will be\nconsidered by the Commission when reviewing applications that require site plan\n(Section 8.3) and/or special use permit (Section 8.11) approval.
