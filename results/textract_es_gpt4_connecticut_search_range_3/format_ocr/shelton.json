The purpose and intent of this\nSECTION is to accommodate the need for Cell Sites in a manner that protects the\nmunicipality, minimizes conflict with adjacent uses and the surrounding area, and to\nassure the health and safety of the public. The City of Shelton and the Commission\nrecognizes the quasi-public nature of cellular communications systems and finds that these\nregulations are consistent with the 1996 Act and are necessary to protect the ecological,\nscenic, historical and recreational values of the community and to ensure that visual and\noperational effects will not disturb the integrity of residential neighborhoods or contribute\nto degradation of the surrounding area. More specifically, the purposes are:\na. to accommodate the need for cellular communications antennae while regulating their\nlocation and number;\nb. to minimize adverse visual effects of cellular communications antennae and antenna or\ncell site towers through proper design, siting and vegetative screening;\nC.\nto avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna or cell site towers and\nfalling ice through their proper siting and engineering;\nd. to encourage the joint use of any new antenna or cell site tower; and to reduce the\nnumber of antenna or cell site towers needed in the future.\n48.2 Site Selection Policies: In the location of new cell sites, consideration must be given\nto locations in the following order of preference, with due consideration of\nmunicipally owner property as appropriate:\na.\nAs co-located facilities on existing towers, tanks, water towers and existing buildings\nand similar structures in all districts, with preference given to non-residential districts;\nb. In those locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings or other\nstructures provide the greatest amount of screening;\nC.\nOn new towers on bare ground in non-residential districts with visual mitigation\nwherever possible;\nd. On governmental, institutional or other structures in residential districts;\ne. On new towers with maximum visual mitigation in residential districts.\n48.3\nApplication Process: An Application for a Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be\nfiled for all cell sites and antennas. The Application shall include a map showing the\nextent of planned coverage within the City of Shelton, approved locations of the\napplicant's other cell sites in the municipality and the location and service area of the\nproposed cell site.\nIV-45\n"}, {"page": "161", "text": "Accessory buildings and structures needed to house equipment in support of a co-located\ncell site will require an Application for Site Plan Approval for those facilities.

The\napplicant must explain the selection process, pursuant to the policies set forth\nabove and document why a Co-Located Cell Site is not possible. Documentation\nwill be assessed with regard to technological unfeasibility, availability of a suitable\nsite, structural feasibility or other proof supported by documentation. Evidence\nmust be included that the owners of all potential locations have been contacted and\nasked for permission to install the antennas on those structures and each was\ndenied for other than economic reasons. This would include water towers, smoke\nstacks, high buildings, antenna or towers of other cellular communications\ncompanies, other communications towers (fire, police, etc.) and other tall\nstructures. Absence of a good faith effort to mount the antennae on an existing\nstructure shall be sufficient grounds for denial of the Application by the Planning\nand Zoning Commission.\n48.4 Monitoring of Emissions: While the FCC has the sole authority to determine what\nstandards wireless facilities must meet to ensure that their radio frequency emissions do\nnot harm humans or the environment, the Commission may require facilities to be\nmonitored to determine compliance with FCC standards. Upon commencement of\noperation of the wireless service or at any subsequent time, the Commission may require\nthe owner of said facilities to pay for a qualified, independent consultant, hired by the\nCity, to conduct testing and monitoring of EMF radiation emitted from said site. Said\nmonitoring shall conform to uniformly accepted practices and the results shall be reported\nto the Commission, the City Engineer and The Valley Health District. If such monitoring\nshould reveal non-compliance with FCC standards, the facility owner shall be given 15\ndays from the date of official notice to reduce emissions to a level of compliance with FCC\nstandards. Failure to attain compliance shall be reported to the appropriate office of the\nFCC and shall be deemed a zoning violation and subject to the penalties and fines\napplicable to such violations. Such penalties and fines shall be payable to the City of\nShelton by the owner of the wireless facility until compliance is achieved.\n48.5 Co-Located Cell Site Constraints: Any antenna that is mounted or attached to an\nexisting communications tower, water tower, governmental or institutional building or\nother high building or structure is permitted in all Districts, subject to the following\nmaximum height provisions:\na.\nOmni directional or whip antennas shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height or seven\n(7) inches in diameter and shall be of a material or color that matches the exterior of the\nbuilding or structure.\nIV-46\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "b.\nDirectional or panel antennas shall not exceed five (5) feet in height or two (2) feet in\nwidth and shall be of a material or color which matches the exterior of the building or\nstructure.\nC.

Notwithstanding the above, in any residence district the Commission may\npermit an increase of said height to 120 feet for the following reasons: a) in order to\nenhance the potential for co-located cell sites; and/or b) in instances where the\nIV-47\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "proposed tower is located within 200 feet of an existing tower of greater height,\nprovided the increased height does not exceed the height of said existing tower.\n48.6.6 Setbacks: All antenna towers shall be setback from any property line not\nless than the minimum setback required by the district in which it is located or 30\npercent of the antenna height or 40 feet, whichever is the greatest.\n48.6.7 Joint Use Accommodation: In order to minimize the number of cell site\ntowers in the future, all proposed support tower structures are required to\naccommodate additional users, including other wireless communication\ncompanies and local police, fire, ambulance and other non-private emergency\nservices.
