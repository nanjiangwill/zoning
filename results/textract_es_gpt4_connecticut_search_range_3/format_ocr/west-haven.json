An Active Adult\nResidential Community will allow for flexible development of detached or semi-detached\nsingle-family dwellings in the various Residential and Mixed-Use Districts of the City (units\nmay only be attached by a garage and not be connected to any living space within the\nunit). Such a development shall consider the protection of surrounding properties and shall\nprovide for open space and preservation of natural and historic features.\n13.2\nObjectives. An AARC may receive favorable consideration where a proposed\ndevelopment complies with standards for approval of a Special Permit (Section 85) and\nwhere the following conditions are present and the following objectives are achieved:\nThis statement of objectives shall not be subject to variance or exception by any City\nagency.\n13.3\nApplicability.

An Active Adult Residential Community consists of a community\nwhich includes single-family dwelling units with a generally smaller bedroom mix than\ntraditional residential developments. For an AARC, each unit shall be a minimum of 1,000\nsquare feet and possess a maximum of two bedrooms plus one utility (guest study, etc.)\nroom. Accessory uses such as parking lots, garages, and recreational and community uses\nare also permitted, to the extent they are designed and intended to serve the permitted\noccupants of the AARC and are consistent with and appropriate to the needs and\ninterests of those occupants.\n13.5.\nApproval Process. All AARC developments shall require approval of a Special\nPermit and a Site Plan Review by the Planning and Zoning Commission, pursuant to\nSection 75 and 85 of the Zoning Regulations.

It is hereby recognized that the\nCity of West Haven at the time of the adoption of these regulations is substantially\ndeveloped. However, it is equally recognized that the future health of the City requires\ncontinued expansion of its industrial base. These regulations are designed to encourage\nmodernization and development of the City's industrial potential while protecting the\npublic health, safety and general welfare. It is recognized that while these goals are\nsometimes contradictory, cohesive industrial development can meet the community\nneeds and concerns now and in the future.\n25.2\nINTENT\nIt is the further intent of these regulations:\nTo separate and segregate industrial uses from residential and commercial uses,\nand\nto encourage industrial development which is free from the danger of fire, toxic\nand noxious matter, explosions and other hazards, and\nto prevent as much as possible development that will cause offensive, noise,\nvibration, smoke, dust and particulate matter odor, and\nto provide sufficient accessory use facilities to prevent traffic congestion and\nsafety hazards, and\nto locate industrial uses in such areas where provision can be made to protect\nadjoining non-industrial districts through natural or constructed buffers.\n25.3 USE REGULATIONS\n25.3.1\nInterpretation.

The regulations governing non-conforming and\nnon-complying uses set forth in this Article are therefore adopted in order to provide\na gradual remedying of existing undesirable conditions resulting from such incompat-\nible use of property which is detrimental to the achievement of the purposes of these\nregulations. When such uses are generally permitted to continue, these regulations\nare designed to restrict further investment in such uses which would make them\nmore permanent establishments in inappropriate locations.\nIn the case of buildings, structures and/or lots not complying with the applicable\narea and bulk requirements of the regulations, the regulations governing same set\nforth in this Article are adopted to permit the appropriate use of such buildings, but\nprevent the creation of additional non-compliances, increases in the degree of\nexisting noncompliance or expansions which would be detrimental to the safety and\nwelfare of the surrounding neighborhood.\nThese regulations are thus designed to preserve the character of the Districts\nestablished in these regulations in the light of their particular suitability to specified\nuses, and thus to promote and protect public health, safety and general welfare.\n81.2 DEFINITIONS\nEach of the following definitions shall apply to situations which will arise from time to\ntime in the interpretations of these regulations with respect to non-conforming uses\nand non-complying lots or structures.

For the purpose of this Article, any such damage or\ndestruction which occurs over an extended period of time (but within two years\nfrom first occurrence) shall be deemed to be a single event.\nDISCONTINUANCE: The intentional or unintentional cessation of a nonconforming\nuse of the property on a daily basis.\nINONCONFORMING USES, LOTS OR STRUCTURES\nPAGE 81-1\n"}, {"page": "233", "text": "WEST HAVEN, CONNECTICUT ZONING\nREGULATION\n12/31/2019\nENLARGEMENTS OR EXTENSIONS: An increase in the building or structure size or the\nPAGE 81-2\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nincrease in lot coverage.\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nEXPANSION OF USE: 1) The change of a non-conforming use to a use determined to\nbe less-conforming, 2) The addition of another non-conforming use to an existing\nnon-conforming use, or 3) The increase in the intensity of an existing\nnonconforming use (including additional dwellings).\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nINCIDENTAL REPAIRS OR ALTERATIONS: The replacement, upgrading or renovation\nof existing building characteristics or systems, provided that such work does not\ncreate any additional units, rooms, or a greater degree of lot coverage.\nMERGER OF LOTS: The combined use, including use by accessory uses, of one or\nmore recognized lots.\nCELL (4, 1): \n81.3\nCELL (4, 2): \nNON-CONFORMING USES\nCELL (5, 1): \n81.3.1\nCELL (5, 2): \nIntent.
