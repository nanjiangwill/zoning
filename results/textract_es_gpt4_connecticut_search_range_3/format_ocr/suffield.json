AFFORDABLE HOUSING\nThe Commission may grant a special permit after public hearing to allow affordable housing as\ndefined by CGS.\n1. Purpose.\nHigher density zoning may be permitted on a limited basis to provide a greater variety of\nhousing choices. As an incentive to encourage development of affordable housing units, the\nCommission, upon petition and after public hearing, may grant a change of zone for a parcel\nof land, provided that fifty percent (50%) of the additional housing units allowed, shall be\naffordable. In calculating the number of units, provision for open space land (twenty\npercent) will not be deducted nor will a fee be collected in lieu of open space if twenty-five\npercent (25%) or more of the project units are offered as affordable housing. To protect the\npublic health and welfare it is necessary to apply a number of measures to a property in\nquestion in order to be assured that such property can accommodate the desired density.\nTherefore, the following procedure is employed for consideration of such change of zone.\n2. Procedure.\na. An applicant may petition for a change of zone from R-45 to R-25, or R-25 to R-15,\nR-11, or PDA as provided in these regulations and in accordance with the following\nstandards:\n(1) A parcel shall be a minimum of ten (10) developable acres.\nSection V: Special Regulations\nPage 6\n"}, {"page": "82", "text": "Suffield Zoning Regulations\nJuly 12, 2004\n(2) The land proposed for use shall be of such character that it can accommodate\nhigher density use.\n(3) Public water supply shall be available to service the property in question.\n(4) Public sewers shall be available to service the property in question.\n(5) The existing streets in the area shall be adequate for proper circulation and\nincreased traffic generated by more intensive development.\n(6) Existing drainage facilities must be adequate to accommodate an\nintensification of land use.\n(7) Soils must be of such type to accommodate an intensification of land use.\nb. A PDA development may be allowed an additional density bonus of forty (40)\npercent, provided that fifty (50) percent of the additional units are offered\nas\naffordable housing.\nC. A sketch plan shall be submitted to illustrate the number of housing units possible on\na property under its present zoning classification.\nd. A preliminary plan, based on the proposed zoning classification, shall accompany the\napplication. It shall provide adequate information to show that the standards can be\nmet and that design proposals employed will make development compatible with the\nsurrounding area. In addition, said plan will be used in conjunction with Subsection\nC. above to provide a \"bonus\" figure for use in calculating the number of affordable\nhousing units required to qualify under this regulation.\ne. In order to absorb the impact on the town's infrastructure and its ability to provide\nservices, consideration for zone changes will be limited to a total of fifty (50) bonus\nunits (25 affordable) per year.\nf. The commission may consider relaxation of the fifteen (15) percent limitation for\nmulti-family housing as part of the town's housing stock when twenty-five (25)\npercent or more of the proposed units in a project are affordable.\ng. A contract certifying the above shall be drawn by the developer, approved by the\ntown attorney and entered into between the developer and the Town of Suffield.

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION REGULATIONS\n1. Statement of Purpose.\nRecent advances in wireless communications technology have resulted in a new generation of\ntelecommunication services. These new services transmit electromagnetic waves of such a\nfrequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations. These antennas may be\nlocated on buildings, water towers, and other similar structures but will also frequently be\nlocated on new or enlarged towers. This requires that the Town of Suffield regulate wireless\ncommunication system facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio\ntransmission towers which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances.\nA number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the\nFederal Communications Commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the\nnear future. These firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the Town of Suffield and\nthese efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers.\nThe intent of this proposed regulation is to provide for the establishment and or expansion of\nwireless telecommunication services within the Town of Suffield while protecting\nneighborhoods and minimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless\ntelecommunications facilities through careful design, sitting, and screening. More specifically,\nthis regulation has been developed in order to:\na.\nMaximize use of existing and approved towers and other structures to accommodate new\nantennas and transmitters in order to reduce the number of communication towers needed\nto serve the community;\nb. Encourage providers to co-locate their facilities on a single tower;\nC. Site facilities below visually prominent ridge lines;\nd. Minimize the location of facilities in visually sensitive areas;\nSection V: Special Regulations\nPage 38\n"}, {"page": "114", "text": "Suffield Zoning Regulations\nJuly 12, 2004\ne. Encourage creative design measures to camouflage facilities;\nf. Protect historic and residential areas from potential adverse impacts of communication\ntowers; and,\ng. Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering\nand careful sitting of tower structures.\n2. Definitions.\nFor the purpose of applying the provisions of this section the terms below shall be defined as\nfollows:\nAntenna means a device used to receive or transmit electromagnetic waves. Examples\ninclude, but are not limited to, whip antennas, panel antennas, and dish antennas.\nCo-location means locating wireless communication facilities from more than one provider\non a single site.\nWireless telecommunication services means licensed wireless telecommunication services\nincluding, but not necessarily limited to, cellular, personal communication services (PCS),\nspecialized mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio (ESMR), paging,\nand similar services that are marketed to the general public.\nWireless telecommunication site means a facility operated by a licensed wireless telecommun-\nication service provider which consists of the equipment and structures involved in receiving\nor transmitting electromagnetic waves associated with wireless telecommunication services.\nHeight of tower means the vertical distance measured in feet from the average existing level\nof the ground surrounding the tower and within ten feet thereof to the topmost point of the\ntower including any antenna or other appurtenances. The existing elevation shall mean the\nactual or approved elevations of the property at the time of application.\nTower means a structure that is intended to support equipment used to receive and/or transmit\nelectromagnetic waves. Design examples of towers include: (a) self-supporting lattice, (b)\nguyed, and (c) monopole.\n3. Location Preferences.\nThe locations for sitting the equipment involved in receiving or transmitting electromagnetic\nwaves associated with wireless telecommunication services are listed in Paragraph 1 through 6\nbelow, in order of preference.\na. On existing structures such as buildings, water towers, and utility poles.\nb. On existing or approved towers.\nSection V: Special Regulations\nPage 39\n"}, {"page": "115", "text": "Suffield Zoning Regulations\nJuly 12, 2004\nC.
