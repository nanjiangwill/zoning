Purpose.\nA site plan is required for certain uses in order to determine the conformity of a proposed\nactivity with these regulations. The site plan shall be prepared with due consideration\nfor the purpose and intent of these regulations, including protection of public health,\nsafety, comfort and convenience, coordination with and improvement of vehicular and\npedestrian access, provision of adequate drainage and utilities, appropriate lighting\nand landscaping, protection of natural resources, conservation of the natural terrain,\nprovision for vegetation on the site to the maximum extent practical, and maintenance of\narchitectural harmony with the surrounding area. Article 11 establishes procedural and\ninformational requirements for site plans.\n\u00a7 315-11.2. Requirements for site plan.\nWhen a site plan is required by these regulations, no zoning permit shall be issued by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) until a site plan meeting all applicable requirements\nof this article has been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, or by its\nZEO, if SO delegated. Generally, the responsibility for site plan review and approval\nis delegated to the ZEO, unless the ZEO requests the Commission review and act on\na specific application. The Commission may also direct the ZEO to forward the site\nplan to the Commission for its action. In addition, an applicant may request that the\nCommission serve as the reviewing authority for a specific application, which request\nthe Commission may grant at its discretion. In all cases, the final decision as to who is\nthe reviewing authority shall be made by the Commission.\nA.\nUnless otherwise specified in these regulations, a site plan is required for all\nproposed uses or changes of use, except the following:\n(1) A family dwelling unit, except as subject to special permit review under\nArticle 14, Conservation District, or where the proposed use is within 100 feet\nof tidal wetlands, coastal bluffs and escarpments. Applications for family\ndwellings must include the information required in \u00a7 315-10.3A. In addition,\na site plan may be required by the Commission or its representative (ZEO)\nwhen topography, soils, existing development, mixed uses or other factors\nmake it infeasible to properly determine conformance with the Zoning\nRegulations without a site plan.\n(2)\nWithin all districts, when an existing permitted use located within a structure\nis changed to another permitted use located within the same structure,\nprovided that the ZEO determines that the new use will not result in either the\nalteration of the exterior of the structure or an intensification of the use of the\nstructure. Intensification shall be defined as additional residential units,\nadditional employment, additional clients or customers, additional floor space\nfor sales or services, or additional required parking than existed prior to the\nchange of use. A plot plan and statement of use are required for the change of\nuse.\n(3) Any use for which the Commission/ZEO approves a waiver of site plan\n315:47\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "\u00a7 315-11.2\nLYME CODE\n\u00a7 315-11.4\nrequirements under \u00a7 315-11.2B.\nB.\nWaiver of site plan requirements. In addition to uses and activities specifically\nexempted elsewhere in these regulations, the ZEO may waive requirements for a\nsite plan if the ZEO determines that a proposed activity will not affect existing\ntraffic circulation, nor result in an increase in the need for parking, nor shall there\nbe any significant exterior change to a building or site, nor shall such new activity\nhave an impact on surrounding properties and the neighborhood substantially\ndifferent from the existing use from which the change is requested.

In order to avoid unnecessary delay\nand expense for an applicant whose proposed activity is minor in nature and limited\nin its impact on the surrounding area, the ZEO may exempt any application from\nspecific information requirements as set forth in this article. Such exemption may\nbe approved if the ZEO finds that such information would not aid in determining\nthe application's compliance with these regulations.\n\u00a7 315-11.3. Optional informal discussion of site plan with Commission.\nAny applicant for a use requiring site plan approval may request the placement of such a\nproposal on the agenda of a regular or special meeting of the Commission for the purpose\nof presenting preliminary plans or concepts, and for receiving preliminary comments,\nobservations and questions, and identifying areas of concern. Neither the applicant nor\nthe Commission shall be bound by statements made in such informal discussions, their\npurpose being only to minimize delay, expense and inconvenience to the applicant, the\npublic, and the Commission upon further receipt, if any, of a formal submission of the\nsite plan. At this informal discussion, the applicant may request a full or partial waiver\nof site plan requirements under \u00a7 315-11.2B and C. Following informal discussion, the\nCommission may suggest that the proposal or certain aspects thereof be referred to\nother municipal, state or federal agencies for review and comment or may suggest that\nadditional information is or will be required prior to action on a formal application for\nsite plan approval.\n\u00a7 315-11.4.

Careful consideration should be given to the planning and\nlocation of main haul or skid roads. All road locations, including alternate routes\nwhere advisable, will be planned prior to harvesting operations. Logging shall be\ntimed to occur during the dry part of the year, or when the ground is frozen. If\nunusual rainfall occurs after the start of logging, all operations shall cease for such\nperiod of time as is necessary for the ground to dry out. The use of log forwarders\nis encouraged as opposed to skidders. Forwarders are in general less damaging to\nthe environment and remaining trees along the logging trails. Outstanding\nconsiderations are as follows:\n(1) Location SO as to minimize construction or use impact on the land.\n(2)\nGrades in excess of 10% (steep slopes) or 0% (flat) gradients will be avoided\nexcept for short distances.\n(3) For each road, landing or skid trail, drainage control systems or stabilization\nshall be provided and maintained to control water flow.\n(4) Unless otherwise stipulated, all roads, main skid trails, landings and sawmill\nsites will be stabilized. Temporary culverts will be removed, water bars\ninstalled where necessary, ruts filled or graded out and gutters cleaned.\n(5) Where required for erosion control or where desirable from a wildlife\nstandpoint, major skid roads, landings and/or sawmill sites will be limed,\nfertilized and seeded with an appropriate mixture of native grass and legumes.\nC.\nAesthetic considerations.\n(1) Border strips.\n(a) Within approximately 100 feet of any automobile road, recreation trail or\nother recreation area on public land, or boundary line in proximity to any\ndwelling, harvesting of trees will be partial cuttings. Not more than 50%\nof the merchantable volume should be removed except in salvage\noperations, to open up scenic vistas, or in forestry demonstration areas.

Purpose and intent.\nA.\nThe purpose of the Eightmile Watershed Overlay District is to protect and enhance\nthe functions and values of the riparian and wetlands features of the Eightmile River\nWatershed, as identified in the Eightmile River Wild and Scenic River Management\nStudy, completed in December 2005. These features are a key component of the\nlargely intact watersheds and natural character of Lyme. In order to preserve a fully\nfunctioning aquatic system in the Eightmile River Watershed and to prevent\ndamage to the critical buffer area around its water bodies, the Eightmile Watershed\nOverlay District is hereby established.\nB.\nWithin the Eightmile Watershed Overlay District, it is intended that there shall be a\ncontinuous buffer consisting of a predominately forested condition that is native to\nthe region and appropriate to the environment in which it is to be planted or\nretained. Protection of a vegetated buffer around watercourses is crucial for public\nhealth, safety, and welfare because the buffer regulates water flow, preserves\ndiversity and abundance of wildlife species and habitat, protects water quality, and\nmaintains important cultural and historical features of the Town.\nC.\nSpecifically, the required buffer functions to regulate water flow by promoting\nwater infiltration and groundwater recharge and by reducing streambed scour. The\nbuffer preserves wildlife by providing a unique habitat such as course woody debris\nthat supports a diverse species assemblage and provides an effective travel corridor\nfor terrestrial wildlife. The buffer filters and moderates stream flow and keeps\ntemperatures low, improving habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms. The\nbuffer protects water quality by reducing sedimentation and by filtering out\npesticides, heavy metals, and biocontaminants. The buffer removes excess nutrients\nthat lead to eutrophication, including nitrogen and phosphorus. It prevents erosion\nthrough bank stabilization by vegetation. Further the buffer provides a screen that\nprotects privacy of riverfront landowners and enhances landscape diversity\nresulting in improved aesthetics.\n\u00a7 315-19.2. Boundaries.\nThe Eightmile Watershed Overlay District, here and after referred to as the \"district,\"\napplies to the Eightmile River and all perennial streams in the Eightmile River watershed\nand the area landward and horizontal from the stream edge of those streams defined\nby the official Eightmile Watershed Overlay District Map,17 for a distance of 50 feet\nfor smaller headwater streams and 100 feet for larger streams as marked on said map.\nA stream edge is defined as the ordinary high-water mark, typically identified by\nvegetation or soil types that are distinct from the upland area. The district area does\nnot encompass wetlands or vernal pools, or Hamburg Cove as defined by the Eightmile\nRiver main stem from the Connecticut River to the south edge of the Joshuatown Road\nbridge. The foregoing shall not be deemed to exclude Falls Brook or other mapped\nstreams that enter Hamburg Cove south of the Joshuatown Road Bridge.\n17.

Within the district, wherever possible, not less than 90% of\nthe total surface area shall be covered with live vegetation. Diversity of vegetation\nand forest stages is encouraged, including a mix of trees, shrubs and herbaceous\nvegetation not having invasive characteristics (as defined by the most recent version\nof the Connecticut Invasive Plant List, as authorized by Connecticut Public Act\n03-136). The list can be obtained from the Land Use Office. A variety of plant types\nis more effective at capturing a wide range of pollutants than a single vegetation\ntype.
