While these are\nonly guidelines and do not carry the authority of regulation --- they are very important. Scotland\nstrongly desires development within this area that will enhance the community's historic strengths\nand grow the town economically.\nWe urge persons to review this document and then discuss their ideas for development with the\nCommission. These preliminary discussions will better ensure that your application will be in line\nwith our regulations and the character of the community.\nVillage District\nThe Scotland Village District represents a unique and historically significant place in the Town. The\nVillage District includes the section of Huntington Road (State Route 14) between the Huntington\nHomestead Museum and approximately 500 feet east of the post office (State Routes 14 and 97). The\nsite also includes two local roads; all of Center Street and Brook Road from the intersection with Route\n14 to the Scotland Elementary School.\nThe objective of these design guidelines is to provide citizens, landowners, business owners and\ndevelopers with clear expectations for development and redevelopment guiding principles. Overall,\ndevelopment with the Scotland Village District should:\nStrengthen the character of the District as the focal point of the community and as a\ndestination for shopping, services, and government;\nEncourage development that is distinctive and appropriate\nAssure that future construction, alterations, or additions maintain a relationship to the historic\ndevelopment of the Town through\nappropriate design\nThe architecture and site design of\na project should subsequently\ncontribute to the established\ndesign character of the District.\nThese Design Guidelines apply to all\nproposed development within the Village\nDistrict that is subject to the Town's\nZoning Regulations and do not exempt\napplicants from obtaining all required\npermits and complying with all applicable\nNOT\nORIGINAL\nbuilding codes, laws, and regulations in\n98\n"}, {"page": "104", "text": "Scotland, Connecticut\nZoning Regulations\nforce.\nOverall Architectural Design\n99\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nThe architectural style (compatible and complementary to the rural character of Scotland),\nheight, roofline, materials and proportions of such buildings should be noted when new\nbuildings are designed.
