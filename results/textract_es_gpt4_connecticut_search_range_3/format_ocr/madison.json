The law also requires that the CT Department of Consumer Protection draft\nregulations pertaining to the use and sale of cannabis and to begin accepting applications for\nlicenses. The law further provides for Municipalities to prohibit or enact reasonable\nrestrictions on cannabis establishments. However, if standards are not established, such uses\nwill be deemed a permitted use in zoning districts where similar retail and commercial\nestablishments are allowed.\nThe potential regulation of recreational cannabis creates a multitude of legal, regulatory and\nsafety issues that must be carefully considered. The establishment of a temporary\nmoratorium on the use of land and structures in the Town of Madison for cannabis\nestablishments as defined in PA 21-1 will allow sufficient time for the Town to consider the\nvarious components of this new industry, develop regulations which appropriately address\nthese establishments and coordinate with other Town agencies.\nSection 2: Definition of Terms:\nFor the purpose of this section, the terms referred to herein shall be defined and used as\noutlined in PA 21-1.\nCannabis Establishment: a non-profit, person(s) or business entity otherwise engaged in\nan activity which would be defined as a producer, dispensary facility, cultivator, micro-\ncultivator, retailer, hybrid retailer, food and beverage manufacturer, product manufacturer,\nproduct packager, transporter and, delivery service by PA-21-1 (SB 1201).\nSection 3: Temporary Moratorium:\nFor the reasons set for above, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Zoning\nRegulations to the contrary, the Planning & Zoning Commission hereby adopts a temporary\nmoratorium related to the acceptance, review and/or approval of applications seeking to\nestablish the use of land and/or structures for a Cannabis Establishment and other uses\nrelated to recreational marijuana. This moratorium shall be in effect nine (9) months from\nthe date of adoptions or until such time as the Commission adopts Zoning Regulations that\nregulate the establishments and activities described herein, whichever occurs earlier. While\nthis moratorium is in effect, the Commission will undertake a planning process to evaluate\nthe potential impact of allowing these establishments and consider any draft regulatory\nlanguage provided by the CT Department of Consumer Protection with the ultimate goal of\nadopting a new Zoning Regulation which addresses these uses in a manner that is suitable\nto the Town of Madison.\n(Approved October 21, 2021, Effective November 5, 2021)\n2.21\nBillboards.

The proposal\nshall not require the Town to improve or upgrade existing roads or intersections;\ne) The quality of the historical and natural resources within the proposed zone and the effect\nthe proposal will have on such resources and the uniqueness of animal and plant\ncommunities.

The Planning and Zoning Commission recognizes there are highly visible undeveloped or\nunderdeveloped lots as well as adaptive reuse opportunities in the Town of Madison which may be subject\nto future development. In order to ensure that future development will both enhance the neighborhoods\nadjacent to these sites and advance the goals and strategies of the 2013 Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment and its successor, the Commission hereby creates a Planned Development District (\"PDD\")\nwhich will provide a legislative framework for development on these properties.\n32.2\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE:\n32.2.1. Planned Development Districts (PDD) are intended to provide an attractive alternative to the\nsubdivision of land, to diversify Madison's overall housing portfolio, to encourage open space and\neconomic development by allowing residential, commercial or a mixture of uses in a comprehensively\nplanned setting. The PDD requires sensitivity in design in order to achieve a development that will be\ncomplementary to adjacent land uses while advancing Madison's planning objectives. The provisions of\nthis Section are designed to permit modification of the strict application of the standards and provisions of\nthese Regulations to accomplish the purposes set forth below. Factors to be considered by the Commission\nin approving a Map Amendment to Planned Development District shall include:\n(a) That the location, uses and layout of the proposed PDD are in conformance with the intent\nof, and the goals and objectives contained in, the Plan of Conservation and Development.\n(b) Harmony and compatibility of the PDD with surrounding neighborhoods and land uses,\nincluding the incorporation of adequate buffers to protect abutting property values,\nminimization of traffic impacts on residential streets, to the extent practical, the establishment\nof traffic patterns which direct commercial traffic to major thoroughfares and away from\nresidential areas and provide for adequate on-site parking, prevention of glare and noise from\nnon-residential areas of the development negatively impacting adjoining residential properties\nand protection of groundwater resources where adjoining properties use onsite wells for potable\nwater supplies.\n(c) Protection of natural and historic resources including, but not limited to, inland and tidal\nwetlands and watercourses, coastal resources, groundwater resources, flood plains, ledge\noutcroppings, steep slopes, wildlife habitats, historic sites and landscapes, archaeological\nand/or scenic vistas.\ni. Particular care must be made to limit the visibility of development from scenic and rural\nroads.\nii. Efforts must be made to properly document key cultural, scenic, historical, archaeological\nand natural resources as part of the application process.\niii. Preservation of a minimum of 15 percent of the site that is devoted to residential use as\nopen space.\n32.3.\nESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICT:\n32.3.1. The Commission shall establish the PDD by approving a Master Plan in accordance with Section\n29 of the Regulations and this Section, which, while not intended to be a substitute for detailed\ndocumentation associated with a subsequent site plan approval, shall provide sufficient information\nrequired by Section 29 to determine whether the proposed development is in conformance with Section\n32.2.1 and the Madison Plan of Conservation and Development (\"POCD\"). Such adoption shall constitute\na zoning map amendment, subject to a public hearing in accordance with Section 17 of these Regulations.\nOnce enacted, the PDD will supersede all pre-existing zoning on the specific property and any development\non the rezoned property will be subject to the specific PDD requirements set forth herein.\n152\nTown of Madison, Connecticut\n"}, {"page": "157", "text": "32.3.2.
