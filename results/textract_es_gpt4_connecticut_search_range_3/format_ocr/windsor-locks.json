The AIOZ\ndesignation may waive and modify the underlying existing regulations to encourage a variety of uses, lot dimensions and\ncoverages which best promote development at the interface of the airport corridor.\nA. Applications for designation as an AIOZ will be accepted for the following locations: (1) that area fronting on the\neasterly side of Old County Rd within 2500 feet of its intersection with Route 20; (2)that area on the westerly side of\nSouth Center Street and the northerly side of Route 20 currently zoned B-1, and (3) that area fronting on the Easterly\nside of Route 75, within 2500 feet of its intersection with Route 20.\nB. General Concepts -- In considering the appropriateness of the AIOZ, the Commission shall consider the following:\na. That the potential exists for the zone to accommodate a wide variety of land uses including business,\noffice/business, hotel/motel, conference center, restaurant and residential. That there be minimal restrictions\non the location of these uses within the zone provided that compatibility with an adjacent development (within\nthe zone) or existing land use in an abutting zone, can be satisfactorily demonstrated.\nb.\nThat all development exhibits a high standard of quality in construction detail materials and appearance. That\ndevelopment reflects accepted professional standards of design and is consistent with the applicable state and\nlocal standards, codes and regulations.\nc.\nThat site planning is an essential criterion of the AIOZ. Sites developed in the AIOZ are intended to be carefully\nplanned, both within the sites own boundaries and in relation to surrounding properties.\nd.\nThat sites within the AIOZ be developed in a manner to encourage the reduction of the number of driveway\ncuts onto arterial streets in order to mitigate the deterioration of traffic flow generally caused by driveways on\narterial streets. Shared driveways (or provisions for future shared driveways), interior service drives, and\nrelated techniques shall be encouraged.\ne.\nThat all development be sensitive to environmentally regulated areas within the AIOZ. That maximum effort\nis made to retain and integrate significant natural features into the development proposal wherever possible.\nC. Permitted Uses -- The following uses are deemed appropriate and permitted in the AIOZ but not at every or any\nlocation therein or without restrictions or conditions being imposed by reason of special problems of use, and the\nCommission shall have the discretion to decide whether the mixing of uses is appropriate and should be required or\nmaintained:\na.\nMultiple single family and multi-family dwellings, which shall be subject to the requirements of the MFSD\nzone. b.\nBusiness offices, professional offices, and financial institutions\nc.\nHotels and Motels\nd.\nBanquet and catering facilities, and conference centers\ne.\nFull service restaurants\nf.\nRetail stores, retail service or personal service shops\ng.

The provisions of this regulation have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or\nrestriction on the content of or reasonable access to any communicative materials including sexually oriented\nmaterials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this regulation to restrict or deny access by adults to\nsexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributor and\nexhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this\nregulation, to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.\n2.\nBased on evidence of the secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports, studies and\nother pertinent materials made available to the Planning and Zoning Commission, and on findings,\ninterpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases a list of which is appended hereto\nmarked Exhibit A; and based upon reports, studies and other pertinent materials concerning secondary effects\noccurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, a list of reports, studies and other pertinent materials is\nappended hereto and marked Exhibits\nB and C;\nThe Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Windsor Locks, Connecticut has found:\n1.\nSexually oriented businesses are a permitted use necessitating Planning and Zoning Commission review and\nrequiring special supervision from the town's public safety agencies in order to protect and preserve\nthe\nhealth, safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishments, as well as the health, safety and welfare of\nthe town's citizens.\n2.\nSexually oriented businesses are a category of commercial uses, associated with a wide variety of adverse\nsecondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, lewdness, public\nindecency, unsanitary conditions, potential spread of disease, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking,\nnegative impacts on surrounding properties, blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation; and\n3.\nEach of the forgoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the Town has a substantial\ngovernment interest in preventing, or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary\neffects, which is the town's rationale for the provisions of this regulation, exists independent of any\ncomparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the\nTown's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of\neither current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the Town. The Town finds that the\ncases and documentation relied on in the provisions of this regulation, are reasonably believed to be relevant\nto said secondary effects.\n4.\nStatistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States indicate that\nlarge numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such sexually oriented businesses, especially those which\nprovide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for the private viewing of so-called sexually oriented\nmotion pictures and/or videotapes and/or live entertainment; and are considered sexually oriented cabarets\nwhich feature among other activities live performers characterized by exposure of specified anatomical areas.\n5.\nSuch closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to\nsexually oriented cabarets, have been used by patrons, clients or customers of such sexually oriented\nbusinesses for the purpose of engaging in certain sexual acts.\n6.\nMale and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to provide sex for hire\nto the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such booths, cubicles and rooms.\n7.\nDoors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of such booths,\ncubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use\nencourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms to engage in sexual acts with other patrons\nPage\n73\n"}, {"page": "74", "text": "Zoning Regulations\nTown of Windsor Locks, Connecticut\nand with prostitutes thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which\n8.\n9.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \ncause blood, semen and urine to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and\nrooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come into\ncontact with such deposits.\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nThe reasonable and uniform regulation and supervision of such sexually oriented businesses tends to\ndiscourage such sexual acts and prostitution, and thereby promotes the health, safety and welfare of the\npatrons, clients and customers of such establishments.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nThe continued unregulated operation of sexually oriented businesses, including, without limitation, those\nspecifically cited herein, is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens\nof Windsor Locks.\nCELL (4, 1): \n10.\nCELL (4, 2): \nThe Constitution and laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the Town powers, especially police power, to\nenact reasonable legislation and measure to regulate and supervise sexually oriented businesses as hereinafter\ndefined in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.\nCELL (5, 1): \n11.\nCELL (5, 2): \nIt is not the intent of the Planning and Zoning Commission, in enacting this regulation, to deny to any person\nrights to speech protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions.\nCELL (6, 1): \n12.

Utilities or service equipment located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE\nin the space, will subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates.\nvii.\nA residential building with a structurally attached garage having the floor slab below the BFE is considered\nan enclosed area below the BFE and must meet the standards of Sections F. 3. C i-vi. A garage attached to a\nresidential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for\nthe automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in both directions. Flood openings or vents are required in the\nexterior walls of the garage or in the garage doors. The human intervention necessary to open garage doors\nwhen flooding occurs is not an acceptable means of meeting the openings requirements. In addition to the\nautomatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below BFE must be constructed with flood resistant\nmaterials. Garages attached to non-residential structures must also meet the aforementioned requirements or\nbe dry flood-proofed as per the requirements of Section F. 3. b.\nd.\nSince the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,\npotential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:\nEncroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development shall\nbe prohibited unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer\nis provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00) increase in flood levels\nduring the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences located in the floodway must be aligned with\nthe flow and be of open design. When utilizing data other than that provided by the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency, a regulatory floodway must be adopted which is designed to carry the waters of\nthe base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any\npoint.\nG. Variance Procedure\nRequests for variances from the requirements of this Section shall be heard and decided by the Zoning Board of\nAppeals.\n1.\nVariances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood\ndischarge would result.\n2.\nConsiderations for Granting of Variances\nPage 119\n"}, {"page": "120", "text": "In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all\nrelevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this regulation and the items listed below as a\nthough k. Upon consideration of these factors and the purposes of Section 221 of these regulations the Zoning\nBoard of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further\nthe purposes of this regulation.\na. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;\nb. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;\nC.\nThe susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage\non the individual owner;\nd. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;\ne. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;\nf. The availability of alternative locations, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the\nproposed use;\ng. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;\nh. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for\nthat area;\ni.\nThe safety access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;\nj.\nThe expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the\neffects of wave action, if applicable, expected at this site; and\nk. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and\nrepair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and\nbridges.\n3. Criteria for Variances\na. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,\nconsidering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that\nthe variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and result in the loss of historic\ndesignation of the building. b. Variances may only be issued upon\ni. a showing of good and sufficient cause,\nii. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional\nhardship, and\niii. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional\nthreats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or\nvictimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or regulations.\nOnly hardships, which are based on unusual physical characteristics of the property in question,\ncharacteristics, which are not shared by adjacent parcels, shall qualify to meet subsection 2 above.\nClaims of hardship based on the structure, on economic or on personal circumstances are not sufficient\ncauses for the granting of a variance under this regulation.\nC.\nAny applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between\nthe base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of\nflood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor\nelevation up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage.\nd.\nThe Zoning Enforcement Officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances\nto the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.\n"}, {"page": "121", "text": "Appendix B to the Zoning Regulations\nSee attached diagrams.\nPage I 121\n"}, {"page": "122", "text": "A\nA\nB\nC\nB\nC\nD\nR=5'\nE\nD\n60'\nR=5' , MIN.\nR=5' MIN.\nR=10' MIN.\nR=10' MIN\n90\u00b0 PARKING\n60\u00b0 PARKING\nA\nB\n45\nR=5' MIN.\nR=10' MIN.\n45\u00b0 PARKING\nOff Street Parking Spaces\nRefer to Section 705 C\nZoning Regulations\nAppendix B\nTown of Windsor Locks\nSketch 1\n"}, {"page": "123", "text": "1\" BIT, CONCRETE CLASS II\n1 1/2\" BIT.
