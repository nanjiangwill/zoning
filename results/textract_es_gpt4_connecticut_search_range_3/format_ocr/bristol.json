NON-CONFORMING LOTS, NON-CONFORMING USES, NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES AND NON-\nCONFORMING SITE FEATURES\n1. Purpose -Within the zoning districts established by these Regulations or by amendments that may later be\nadopted, there exist lots, uses, structures and site features which were lawful at the time these Regulations\nwere adopted or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the provisions of\nthese Regulations or future amendments. Such lots, uses, structures and site features are declared by these\nRegulations to be non-conforming. It is the intent of these Regulations to permit these non-conformities to\ncontinue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of these Regulations\nthat non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended if such a change would increase the\nnon-conformity, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same\ndistrict.\na. Non-conforming uses are declared by these Regulations to be incompatible with permitted uses in the\ndistricts involved. After the effective date of adoption or amendment of these Regulations, a non-\nconforming use or a non-conforming structure shall not be extended or enlarged by the attachment to a\nbuilding or land of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other\nuses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.\nb. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in these Regulations shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,\nconstruction, or designated use of any structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to\nthe effective date of adoption or amendment of these Regulations and upon which actual construction has\nbeen carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction\nmaterials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or\nremoval of an existing structure has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or\ndemolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on\ndiligently.\n2. Non-Conforming Lots - In any zone, a principal building and customary accessory buildings or structures\nmay be erected on a lot which exists as of the effective date of adoption or amendment of these Regulations,\nnotwithstanding requirements imposed by other provisions of these Regulations. This provision shall apply\neven though such lot fails to meet the lot area and/or lot width requirements of the district in which such lot is\nlocated, provided that the yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to lot area and/or lot\nwidth shall conform to the requirements of the district in which such lot is located.\n3. Non-Conforming Uses - Where a lawful use of a structure and/or land exists as of the effective date of\nadoption or amendment of these Regulations which is no longer permitted under the provisions of these\n18\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "Regulations as adopted or amended, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,\nsubject to the following provisions:\na. Such non-conforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater floor area\nor area of land than was occupied by the use as of the effective date of adoption or amendment of these\nRegulations.\nb. Such non-conforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the land other than that\noccupied by the use as of the effective date of adoption or amendment of these Regulations.\nC. Any existing structure devoted in whole or in part to such non-conforming use shall not be enlarged,\nextended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered in a manner which increases the non-\nconformity of the use, or except to change the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which\nit is located.\nd. Such non-conforming use may be extended throughout any part of an existing structure that was\nmanifestly arranged or designed for such use as of the effective date of adoption or amendment of these\nRegulations, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the structure.\ne. If such non-conforming use or existing structure devoted in whole or in part thereto is damaged or\ndestroyed by any means, it may be repaired or replaced to an extent which does not increase the non-\nconforming use. Such repair or replacement shall commence within six months after the damage or\ndestruction occurs and shall be completed within 18 months after commencement. If such repair or\nreplacement is not accomplished within such time periods, the non-conforming use shall not thereafter be\nresumed.\nf.\nIf such non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to the\nrequirements of the district in which it is located, and the non-conforming use shall not thereafter be\nresumed.\ng. Such non-conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming use with the approval of the Zoning\nEnforcement Officer. In approving such a change, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall find that the\nproposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-conforming\nuse.\n4. Non-Conforming Structures - Where a lawful structure exists as of the effective date of adoption or\namendment of these Regulations which could not be built under the provisions of these Regulations as\nadopted or amended by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or\nother requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise\nlawful, subject to the following provisions:\na. Such non-conforming structure shall not be enlarged or altered in a manner which increases the non-\nconformity but may be altered to decrease the non-conformity.\nb.\nIf such non-conforming structure is damaged or destroyed by any means, it may be repaired or replaced to\nan extent which does not increase the non-conformity. Such repair or replacement shall commence within\nsix months after the damage or destruction occurs and shall be completed within 18 months after\ncommencement. If such repair or replacement is not accomplished within such time periods, the structure\nshall be reconstructed in conformity with the requirements of the district in which it is located.\nC. Such non-conforming structure shall not be moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever in a\nmanner which increases the non-conformity but may be moved to decrease the non-conformity.\n5. Non-Conforming Site Features - Where a lawful site feature, including but not limited to parking, loading or\nlandscaping, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these Regulations which does not\ncomply with the provisions of these Regulations as enacted or amended by reason of restrictions as to its\n19 -\n"}, {"page": "38", "text": "location on the lot or other requirements applicable thereto, such feature may be continued so long as it\nremains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provision:\na.
