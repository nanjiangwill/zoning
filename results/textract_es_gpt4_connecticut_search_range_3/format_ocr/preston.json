It is the intent of these Regulations to preserve the unique village areas, enhance their\nsense of place, and promote a thriving attractive environment for small scale businesses that are\nappropriate for the village areas. Development of these villages with mixed residential and limited\nbusiness uses with detailed design review will add an incentive for investments in measures to protect\nthe historic qualities of the village including its historic buildings.\nThe Regulations have been enacted pursuant to Section 8-2j of the CGS to allow for creative and\ncomplementary development techniques. As an addendum to these regulations, the Commission has\nprepared separate guidelines that will include property ratings for each village property (this prioritizes\na property for its significance archictecturally and physically), and general design techniques for the\nspecific village. These guidelines are to reflect the unique character of the specific village (for\nexample, \"Preston City Village Design Guidelines\" will reflect the design techniques that complement\nthe character of Preston City Village), and shall be used to aid the intent of the regulations and the\nspecific objective for the specific village.\nFor the purpose of this section, a historic building is as listed on the \"National Register of Historic\nPlaces Registration Form\" as a contributing building for either the Preston City Village Historic District\nor the Poquetanuck Village Historic District.\n12.2 Village Districts (listed)\na) Preston City Village District. Preston City, part of which is a National Register Historic\nDistrict, is an exceptionally well preserved entity containing a high concentration of\ncontributing historic buildings and sites dating from the late seventeenth to the twentieth\ncenturies. This truly authentic New England village has a distinct character that reflects the\nrural atmosphere of the Town. Historically, Preston City has functioned as an agricultural,\nsocial and business center. The district is located within the watershed area for Amos Lake, a\nprominent and significant natural and recreational resource. In order to protect this significant\nresource and its watershed, development within this district is subject to Section 13 of these\nRegulations.\nb) Poquetanuck Village District. Poquetanuck Village is listed on the National Register of\nHistoric Places. Similar to Preston City, Poquetanuck Village has traditionally housed a mixture\nof land uses at a higher density. The village, settled in the 17th century, was the site of early\nsettlement with coastal trading, lumber production, iron making, and shipbuilding, as the major\nindustries. The village generally encompasses a winding portion of Route 2A that extends from\nthe bridge over Halls Brook to the intersection with Route 117 with 2 intersecting roads,\nBrickyard Road and Cider Mill Road. The village is bordered by the sensitive natural and\narchaeological resources of Poquetanuck Cove. In order to protect the significant Cove\nresources and its watershed, development within this district is subject to Section 13 of these\nRegulations.\n12.2.1 Objective: Preston City Village and Poquetanuck Village from their inception to the present,\ncontain both residential and non-residential uses.\n54\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "They are recognized as special places and assets of the Town as evidenced by its inclusion in the\nNational Register of Historic Places as Historic Districts. For these reasons, Preston City Village\nDistrict and Poquetanuck Village District were created.\nThe objective is to improve upon the village character by creating more cohesive and defined villages\nthat reflect the small town rural atmosphere, complements the Preston City and Poquetanuck Village\nNational Register Historic Districts, promotes social and economic vitality, and enhances sense of\ncommunity and place thereby resulting in an improved quality of life for the residents and taxpayers of\nthe Town of Preston.\nPromoting development of Preston City and Poquetanuck Village with mixed uses is part of the\napproach to meet this objective. How property is used within the districts will depend upon the specific\ncharacteristics of the property as noted in the Property Rating Description. Business uses shall be\ndeveloped when such development adds to the overall village character. It is not the intent to allow\nbusiness development \"as of right\", nor is it the intent to create conventional or strip commercial\ndevelopment. Business development is permitted when a conversion or new construction is developed\nin a manner that visually meets the intent and objectives of these Regulations. In addition, it is critical\nthat new construction for single-family homes also comply with the criteria as outlined in the\nRegulations.

There is a need to provide an alternative and creative method to diversify\nhousing opportunities within the Town of Preston in order to encourage affordable housing\nopportunities within the municipality with the goal of achieving the affordable housing threshold\nof ten percent (10%) of the total housing units in the Town of Preston. The Planning and Zoning\nCommission desires to encourage affordable housing with the Town of Preston in a manner that\nwill achieve the following objectives:\nThe AHD will be a Floating Zone governed by a Master Plan prepared in accordance with these\nRegulations. The Master Plan will be subject to review and approval by the Commission as a\nzone change, subject to a public hearing and all other applicable terms and conditions of these\nRegulations. It is recognized that the Master Plan may require fluidity in order to accommodate\nmarket changes that may dictate the need for changes in the design of the affordable housing\nproject during the course of completion of development of the project. In the event that there is\nany substantial and material change proposed for the Master Plan as determined by the\nCommission, the change will be subject to the same procedural requirements for a zone change\nas required by the original zone change application adopting the AHD. Once enacted, the AHD\nwill supersede all pre-existing zoning, and any development on the zoned property will be\nsubject to the specific AHD requirements set forth herein.\n14.2\nApplicability: An Affordable Housing District (AHD) may be permitted in any residential\ndistrict within the Town of Preston, and must contain a minimum of ten (10) developable acres\n61\nCELL (1, 1): \na) to allow, on a long term basis, for the development of diverse housing types, including\nb) to encourage the construction of housing that is both affordable as defined by Connecticut\nCELL (1, 2): \na) to allow, on a long term basis, for the development of diverse housing types, including\naffordable housing to help address identified housing needs within the Town of Preston,\nb) to encourage the construction of housing that is both affordable as defined by Connecticut\nGeneral Statute Section 8-30g et.
