The\nresulting traffic congestion is severe, and is most serious in the commercial districts during\nthe summer months and weekends when on-street parking is most prevalent. Although little\nvacant land remains in the Borough, it is necessary that new commercial and residential\ndevelopment at least provide off-street parking and loading areas required for that use, and\npreferably some surplus to relieve existing off-street parking shortages. In addition, such\nparking areas should be designed so as to be safe for both vehicles and pedestrians,\nattractive, and usable by the widest possible number of uses.\n20\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "2.8.2.

PLANNED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (PI)\n6.3.1. Statement of Purpose\nThe Planning and Zoning Commission of the Borough of Stonington recognizes the historical\nimportance of industrial uses within the Borough and supports the continuation of such uses\nwhere it is practical to do so. At the same time, the Commission wishes to prevent the extension\nof industrial development to other areas of the Borough, due primarily to the traffic congestion\nthat would result from the impact of scattered industrial development on the fragile traffic\ncirculation system and narrow roads within the Borough.\nIn keeping with the Goals and Objectives of the Plan of Conservation and Development, most\nspecifically those dealing with \"Economic Development\", the Commission encourages the\ncreative reuse of any industrial properties which have, or may have become vacant or obsolete,\nwhile emphasizing the preservation and enhancement of the historic architectural character of\nexisting industrial areas. It is further recognized that any development in industrial areas must\nbe compatible with adjacent uses, and that industrial sites must be made as attractive, quiet and\notherwise unobtrusive as their nature allows.\n6.3.2 Permitted Uses and Use Categories\n6.3.2.1.

Purpose\nEach use for which a site plan is required has a potentially significant impact upon the unique\ncharacter of the Borough. The Commission recognizes that many uses of land may be\nrendered acceptable or unacceptable for particular locations by numerous factors, including\nappearance and arrangement of structures, compatibility with adjoining uses, capacity of\nadjoining streets, availability of parking, and other considerations enumerated in the\nRegulations. It is intended that the site plan for each use be prepared with due consideration for\nthe purpose and intent of these Regulations; coordination with and improvement of vehicular\nand pedestrian access, drainage and utilities, lighting and landscaping, natural resources,\nhistoric buildings, and other features that support the neighborhood; and protection of the public\nhealth, safety, welfare, property values, and the environment.\n9.2. Requirement for Site Plan\nNo property shall be used, or uses altered in space, time or intensity, nor buildings or structures\nerected, altered or enlarged, except those uses and activities exempted elsewhere in these\nRegulations, and as described below, until a site plan meeting all applicable requirements of\nSection 9 herein has been approved by the Commission.\nSite plan approval from the Commission is not required if: the proposed uses, alterations or\nconstruction will not result in an increase in the need for parking, there is no significant exterior\nchange to the building or site visible from the frontage road or the waters surrounding\nStonington Borough (including Stonington Harbor, Little Narragansett Bay and Fisher's Island\nSound), there is no increase in the gross floor area of a non-conforming building or structure,\nany increase in the gross floor area of a conforming building or structure is itself conforming,\nand any change of use is to another permitted principal use allowed in that district. A Zoning\nCompliance Permit may be required to be obtained from the Zoning Official as per Section 11.2.\nSite plan approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission is required for construction of all\nnew residential, commercial and industrial buildings.\n9.2.1. Exceptions to Site Plan Requirements\nCertain uses and activities are specifically exempted elsewhere in these\nRegulations, from the requirements of obtaining site plan approval under Article 9.\nIn addition, site plan approval shall not be required if the Commission determines\nthat a proposed activity will not result in an increase in the need for parking, nor\nshall it entail any significant exterior change to the building or site, nor shall such\nnew activity have any impact different from the existing use from which the change\nis requested. This exception, however, shall not apply to coastal site plans.\n9.2.2. Partial Exemption of Site Plan Requirements\nIn order to avoid unnecessary delay and expense for the applicant whose proposed activity\nis minor in nature and in its impact on the unique character of the Borough, the Commission\nmay, by resolution, at its discretion, exempt any application from specifically designated\nportions of the requirement for contents of a site plan as set forth in Section 9.5.

Purpose\nIt is recognized that there are certain uses which, because of their nature, cannot be distinctly\nclassified or regulated so as to be uniformly permitted in a particular zoning district, without\ncareful consideration in each case of the impact of such uses upon neighboring uses and the\nsurrounding area, and without careful evaluation of the public need for such uses in the\nparticular locations proposed. Such uses, therefore, shall be treated individually through the\nuse of Special Permits. Special Permits shall be used to evaluate other uses or development as\nindicated elsewhere in these Regulations.\n10.2. Application for Special Permits\nEach application for the approval of a Special Permit shall be filed with the Zoning Official on a\nform provided by the Commission at least five calendar days prior to the Commission's next\nregularly scheduled meeting and shall be accompanied by a fee as specified in Section 11.4 of\nthese Regulations. The Commission shall not take action on any Special Permit application\nuntil after a public hearing has been held in accordance with the requirements of Section 8-3c of\nthe Connecticut General Statutes.\nEach Special Permit application shall include a site plan prepared in accordance with the\nrequirements of Section 9 of these Regulations. Informal discussion of the site plan is\nespecially encouraged for Special Permit applications (see Section 9.3). The Commission may\ntake action simultaneously on both the Special Permit application and the site plan prepared for\nthe subject property; however, approval of the Special Permit application shall not constitute\napproval of the site plan for the subject site unless specifically stated by the Commission.\n10.3. Notification of Adjacent Property Owners\nEach application for a Special Permit shall include a list, prepared by the applicant, of the\nnames and addresses of the owners of all land included within the application and of all\nproperties 150 feet or less distant therefrom, all as shown on the most recent records on file in\nthe Town of Stonington Tax Assessor's Office. The application shall mail notification of said\npending application to at least one owner of each such property not more than twenty days, and\nnot less than ten days before the date set for the public hearing, by transmitting the text of the\npublic hearing notice as provided by the Commission. Evidence of such mailing, in the form of\nUnited States Post Office Certificates of Mailing, shall be submitted to the Zoning Official along\nwith said list of property owners, not less than five calendar days prior to the hearing date.\nFailure to comply with the procedures required herein shall be deemed a valid basis for denial of\na Special Permit application.
