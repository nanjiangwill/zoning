The zoning board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties:\na. Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order,\nrequirement or decision made by the official charged with the enforcement of these\nregulations.\nb. Variances. To determine and vary the application of these regulations in harmony with their\ngeneral purpose and intent, and with due consideration for conserving the public health,\nsafety, convenience, welfare and property values solely with respect to a parcel of land where\nowing to conditions especially affecting such parcel but not generally affecting the district in\nwhich it is situated, a literal enforcement of such regulations would result in exceptional\ndifficulty or unusual hardship SO that substantial justice will be done and public safety and\nwelfare secured.\nNo variance shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals unless it finds the following:\ni.\nThe variance would be in harmony with the purposes of these regulations, as set forth\nin section 1.2 of these regulations;\nii.\nThe literal enforcement of these regulations would result in unusual hardship, as the\nsame has been defined by the courts of the state of Connecticut and as summarized:\niii.\nThe hardship recognized by the law is that of the property, due to its unique shape,\ntopography, or other inherent condition; the personal hardship of the owner, such as\nage or family condition, is not a legal hardship which would support the granting of a\nvariance; except to the extent required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\niv.\nThe hardship must not be merely financial, such as that the owner would make more\nmoney or lose less money if the variance were granted, as financial hardship is\npersonal, and not inherent in the property itself.\nV.\nThe hardship must be unique to the property, in the sense that it is a characteristic\nwhich is not exhibited by other properties in the area or in the district, and which\nmakes it appropriate for special treatment. Merely being too small or too narrow is\nnot a legal hardship unless it restricts the property from being put to a reasonable use\npermitted in the subject district.\nvi.\nThe hardship must not be created by the owner or his/her predecessor in title, such as\nby dividing a parcel to create lots which cannot support the desired use; or creating a\ntopographic condition by excavation, fill, or other measures which render the property\nunusable for its highest use without a variance; or by building a structure which, for\nwhatever reason, violates a current zoning regulation.\n154\n"}, {"page": "158", "text": "Winchester Zoning Regulations\nAPPENDIX B - ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS\nvii.\nIn accordance with Connecticut case law, the board is prohibited from varying any\ncondition or requirement set forth in these regulations for a special exception use,\nsuch uses being permitted in the subject district only when all conditions or\nrequirements contained here are satisfied.\nviii.\nThe burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the requirements for a variance\nhave been met.\nix.\nVariances are to be granted sparingly, and only to the minimum extent necessary to\nallow property to be used for the least intense use which is permitted in the subject\ndistrict.\nC.\nUse Variance.
