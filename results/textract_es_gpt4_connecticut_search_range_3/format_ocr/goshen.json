The GOS shall be determined by the use of standard Erlang B\nCalculations.

In the\ncase of cellular communications in a rural area like Goshen, this would be a signal strength of at least -90dBm, as\nlong as the signal regains its strength to greater than -90dBm further away from the Base Station.
