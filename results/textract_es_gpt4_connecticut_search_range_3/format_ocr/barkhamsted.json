Landscape Standards and Requirements\nA. Purpose\n(1). The purpose of this section is to establish landscape standards compatible with the rural character\nof the Town, to retain natural vegetation for scenic and water quality purposes and to enhance the\nappearance of public areas, such as parking lots.\n(2). Properly placed and designed landscape areas help to visually separate different categories of land\nuses and minimize the conflict between adjoining uses of land. Site development factors, such as noise,\nglare of lights, signs, incompatible buildings, parking and loading areas, accessways and circulation areas\ncan be mitigated by landscape buffers. Landscape areas provide visually attractive separating spaces that\nreduce these adverse impacts.\nB. Standards and Requirements. For all uses other than permitted residential uses, the portion of a lot\ncovered by buildings, other structures, outside storage or paved areas shall be suitably landscaped with\ntrees, shrubs, lawns or other landscape materials. Areas not disturbed by filling, grading, excavation or\nother construction activity, shall be wherever possible left as natural terrain.\nC. Landscape Plan Required.\n(1). The Commission may require submission of a Landscape Plan as part of any\nSpecial Exception application.\n(2). It shall require a landscape Plan as part of the Site Plan application for\ndevelopment of a lot located in non-residential zones and for a Special Exception\napplication involving a non-residential use located on a lot in residential\nzone.\n(3).

The purpose of these regulations is to provide specific standards in regard to lighting, in\norder to maximize the effectiveness of site lighting, to enhance public safety and welfare, to avoid\nunnecessary upward illumination and illumination of adjacent properties and to reduce glare. All business,\nresidential and community roadways, sidewalks and Town property luminaries should be planned and\ninstalled with the idea of being a \"good neighbor\" by keeping unnecessary direct light from shining onto\nabutting properties or roadways, both public and private.\n12/08/2015\n46\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "Except as herein provided, these regulations shall apply to any outdoor lighting fixture installed, modified\nor refurbished within the Town of Barkhamsted. This regulation applies to all sites located in non-\nresidential zones and special exception uses in residential zones.\nB. Definitions:\nDirect Light. Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through\nthe refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.\nDirect Light Source. The lamp or bulb that produces the actual light.\nFull Cut-Off Type Fixture. A luminaire or light fixture that, by design of the housing, does not allow\nany light dispersion or direct glare to shine above a 90 degree horizontal plane from the base, or the\npurpose of the design is defeated, and disability glare will result.\nFully Shielded Lights. Fully shielded luminaire light fixtures allow you to control the glare in any\ndirection.\nGlare. Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a\nviewer's ability\nto see, and in extreme cases, causing momentary blindness.\nHeight of Luminaries. The height of luminaries shall be the vertical distance from the ground directly\nbelow the centerline of the luminary to the lowest direct light-emitting part of the luminaire.\nIndirect Lighting. Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.\nIsodiagram. An isodiagram is a graphical representation of point of equal illuminance drawn as single\nline circular patterns or computer generated spot reading in a grid pattern on a site plan. Lighting\ndesigners and manufactures generate these diagrams to show the level and evenness of a lighting design\nand to show how light fixtures will perform on a given site.\nLamp. The light source component of luminaries that produce the actual light.\nLight Pollution. Stray or reflected light that is emitted into the atmosphere, beyond the 90 degree\nhorizontal plane. Dust, water, vapor and other pollutants reflect this light causing an unwanted sky-glow.\nLight Trespas. Light from an artificial light source that is intruding into an area where it is not wanted or\ndoes not belong.\nLumen. A unit of luminous flux. One foot-candle is one lumen per square foot. For the purposes of this\nregulation, the lumen-output values shall be the INTIAL lumen output ratings of a lamp.\nLuminaire. A complete lighting system and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture.\nOutdoor Lighting. The night time illumination of an outside area or object by any man made\ndevicelocated outdoors that produces light by any means.\nRatio. Uniformity ratio, describing the average level of illumination in relation to the lowest level of\nillumination for a given area.\nExample: U.ratio = 4:1 for the given area, the lowest level of illumination (1) should be no less than 1/4\nor 4 times less than the average (4) level of illumination.\nUplighting. Any light source that distributes illumination above a 90 degree horizontal plane.\nC. Lighting Plan. Outside lighting for non-residential and multi-family uses will be subject to a site plan\nreview, unless waived in writing by the Commission and shall be accompanied by a lighting plan\nshowing:\n(1) The location, height and type of any outdoor lighting luminaries, including building mounted.\n(2). The luminaire manufacturer's specification data, including lumen output and photometric data\nshowing cutoff angles, the type of lamp (metal halide, compact fluorescent, high pressure sodium).\n(3).

All exterior lights and illuminated signs shall be designed, located, installed and directed in such a\nmanner as to prevent objectionable light trespass at (and glare across) the property lines and disability\nglare at any location on or off the property. The \"maintained horizontal illuminance recommendations\" set\nby the Illumination Engineer Society of North America (IES) shall be observed. (See Appendix A and B)\n(2). All lighting for parking and pedestrian areas will be full cut-off type fixtures. Floodlighting is\nprohibited.\n(3). Lighting for display, building and aesthetics must be shielded to prevent direct glare and/or light\ntrespass and must also be, as much as physically possible, contained to the target area. All building\nlighting for security or aesthetics will be full cut off or a fully shielded/recessed type, not allowing any\nupward distribution of light.\n(4). Adjacent to residential property and in all residential zones, no direct light source will be visible at the\nproperty line at ground level or above.\n(5). Employ soft, transitional light levels, which are consistent from area to area. Minimize contrast\nbetween light sources, lit areas and dark surroundings.\n(6). All non-essential lighting, except signs, will be required to be turned off after business hours, leaving\nonly the necessary lighting for site security - motion or infrared sensor lighting is encouraged.\n(7). Ornamental lighting designed to highlight flagpoles, sculptures or landscape feature should be\ntargeted directly at the object and should note extend 10% beyond the perimeter of the object.\n(8). The height of luminaries, except streetlight in public right-of-ways, shall be the minimum height\nnecessary to provide adequate illumination, but shall not exceed a height of 24 feet, including the base.\n(9).
