Nevertheless, Connecticut towns have\nbeen advised by the CSC to maintain their tower regulations as advisory to the CSC process, which\nis conducted in partnership with municipalities according to state statute. In 2007, the\nConnecticut State legislature passed Public Act #07-222 that requires the CSC to officially take a\nTown's regulations, including for cell towers as well as Plans of Conservation & Development, into\nconsideration in tower siting. Because Warren has no final jurisdiction over the siting of free-\nstanding telecommunications towers at this time, those aspects that pertain to free-standing\ntowers in SECTION 26 are to be considered advisory to the CSC. SECTION 26 was updated in 2011\nto be consistent with federal and state laws. Although the Town of Warren can comment on the\nacceptability of any free-standing telecommunications tower facility that comes before the CSC, it\nis understood that the provisions in SECTION 26 are advisory only and are legally unenforceable at\nthis time in the State of Connecticut. It is also understood that no application fees for free-\nstanding towers under CSC review are payable directly to the Town of Warren. The Town may, at\nits discretion and sole expense, hire independent consultants, including, but not limited to, RF\nengineers, to review any application that comes before the CSC. In the event that jurisdiction over\nthe placement of free-standing telecommunications towers returns to Connecticut municipalities,\nin whole or in part, SECTION 26 will be reviewed for technical accuracy and legal consistency;\napplication fees will be reassessed; consultant fees will be payable by the applicant directly to the\ntown; and SECTION 26 will be returned to full Warren Planning and Zoning Commission Special\nException Permit regulatory status in a timely manner.\n26.2\nTransmission Equipment Mounted On, Or In, Pre-Existing Buildings:\nConnecticut municipalities maintain full control over the placement, construction, and\nmodification of telecommunications transmitting antennas, accessory buildings/equipment and\nantenna arrays placed on, or in, pre-existing buildings. SECTION 26 - SPECIAL PERMIT FOR\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES AND TOWERS contains review guidelines for such applications\nand shall therefore be used by the Commission to review all such applications in accordance with\nstate and federal law, under Special Use Permit, subject to the exclusions noted below, and for\nany other aspect in which the Town of Warren maintains jurisdiction over telecommunications\nfacilities now and/or in the future. For transmission equipment applications mounted on, or in,\npre-existing buildings, Commission review shall include, but is not limited to, the following\nprovisions in SECTION 26:\nCompliance with the Town's Plan of Conservation and Development;\nPreservation of historic buildings;\nProtection of wetlands and environmentally sensitive areas;\nSetback requirements from dwellings and property lines;\nAntenna height when mounted outside on pre-existing structures;\nHiring of independent consultants at the applicant's expense;\nRequirements for structural integrity,\nDeterminations for adequate coverage and adequate capacity;\nMonitoring for radio frequency (RF) compliance with Federal Communications\nCommission (FCC) emissions standards;\nBonding, fees, and whatever else the Commission deems necessary to review an\napplication contained in SECTION 31 Special Exception Permit regulations.\n56\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "26.3\nExclusions, Exemptions, and Disallowances:\nNo antennas or transmission equipment shall be mounted on, or in, preexisting structures less\nthan 50 feet in height as measured at ground level.

This Facility may be sited on\none or more Towers or structure(s) owned and permitted by another owner or entity.\nPERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDER - An entity, licensed by the FCC to provide Personal\nWireless Services to individuals or institutions.\nRADIAL PLOTS - Radial plots are the result of drawing equally-spaced lines (radials) from the point\nof an antenna, calculating the expected signal and indicating this graphically on a map. The\nrelative signal strength may be indicated by varying the size or color at each point being studied\nalong the radial; a threshold plot uses a mark to indicate whether that point is strong enough to\nprovide adequate coverage -- i.e. the points meeting the threshold of adequate coverage.
