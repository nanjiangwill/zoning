Increased development without proper consideration of\nstormwater impacts is a significant source of pollution to surface and ground water.\nThese water resources are valuable natural, economic, recreational, cultural, and\naesthetic resources, and their protection and preservation is in the public interest and\nessential to the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the Town. It is therefore the\npurpose of this section to protect and preserve the resources within the Town of Sterling\nby managing storm water flows in accordance with the Connecticut Department of\nEnvironmental Protection \"Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual\" (CSQM) as\namended. The provisions of these Regulations are pursuant to Connecticut State Statutes\nand shall apply to all development occurring within the Town. The provisions of this\nsection of these Regulations shall be the minimum requirements for stormwater\nmanagement plans in the Town of Sterling, and the enactment of this Regulation shall not\npreclude the application of applicable town, state and/or federal regulations to the\nfacilities regulated thereby.\n109.2 Applicability. A Stormwater Management Plan is required for any development requiring\na Site Plan or for a Subdivision/Re-subdivision that involves the disruption, clearing or\nremoval of ground cover or soil material, or the creation of impervious surfaces in an area\ngreater than one (1) acre, or one half (.5) acre if located in the Seasonal Use or Aquifer\nProtection Overlay Area. The stormwater management plan is to be designed to be\nconsistent with the CSQM as amended. The Commission shall use the standards and\ncriteria for decision outlined in the CSQM as amended when reviewing the Stormwater\nManagement Plan.\n109.3 Design Criteria.\nA. Sedimentation. The system shall remove eighty (80) percent of the annual solid\npollutant loading. This can be met by providing manufacturers data sheets, or\ncalculations verifying the adequacy of a site designed system. CSQM guidelines may\nAPPENDIX C\n9 Page\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "Appendix\nC\nSITE PLAN REQUIREMENTS\nbe used in such calculations, or the Engineer may use other methodologies with\nprior approval of the Town Engineer.\nB. Stormwater Flow. Provide individual watershed stormwater flows across the site\nboundary (property line) equal to or less than the pre-existing condition. In other\nwords, flows may not be increased within any watershed after development. This\nshall be provided for the 2, 10, 25 and 100-year rainfall events. The plan must also\ninclude pre-development and post-development flow calculations.\nC. Stormwater Volume. For each of the design rainfall events (above), the volume of\nstormwater leaving the site shall be equal to or less than the volume of stormwater\nleaving the site in its pre-existing condition.\nIn granting the plan approval, the Commission may make modifications or impose\nsuch conditions that may be deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the\nCSQM, as amended.\n1. Terms and Conditions. The Stormwater Management Plan shall also provide a\nrelease for each applicant/developer and/or owner and each of their respective\nrepresentatives, heirs, successors and assigns, shall hold the Town of Sterling\nand its officials, employees, representatives, agents, boards, agencies and\ncommissions and each of their respective representatives, heirs, successors and\nassigns, harmless and indemnify them from and against any claims, damages,\nlosses, costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) from any personal injury\n(including death) and property damage resulting from any act or omission of\nsaid applicant/developer and/or owner in the design, construction, inspection,\nmaintenance and operation of stormwater management facilities approved\npursuant to this section of these Regulations, and from any acts or omissions,\nincluding without limitation, negligent acts or omissions of said Town, and/or its\nofficials, employees, representatives, agents, boards, agencies and commissions\nand each of their respective representatives, heirs, successors and assigns in the\napproval and inspection of said facilities or the performance of any activities\npursuant to these Regulation.\n2. Any release pursuant hereto shall apply to the owners and/or lessees of the\nproperty in question and shall run with the land.\n110\nEROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL (SE&SC) PLAN.
