It is intended to insure that the design and\nlayout of the site and the proposed use(s) will constitute suitable and appropriate development in character with the\nneighborhood and will not result in a decrease in property values or a detriment to the present and potential use of the area\nin which it is to be located. Special Permit procedures are also intended to assure that proposed buildings, structures and\nuses will provide for the maintenance of air, surface water and groundwater quality and will not be detrimental to existing\nsources of potable water or other natural or historic resources.\nArticle 5C, Section 2 When Required\nA Special Permit must be issued by the Commission before any person may establish or change any land use, or use,\nerect, construct, move, enlarge, or alter any building or structure, in whole or in part, if the use, structure or building\nresulting from such activity is listed as a Special Permitted Use under Article 4 of these regulations for the zone in which\nit would be located.

Where vegetative cover does not exist or has been\nremoved, new plantings may be required. Finished site contours shall depart only minimally from the character\nof the natural site and the surrounding properties.\n2. Relation of Buildings to Environment: The proposed project or development shall be related harmoniously to the\nterrain and to the use, scale and siting of existing buildings in the vicinity of the site.

All surface water\ndrained from roofs, streets, parking lots and other impervious areas shall be disposed of in a safe and efficient\nmanner that will not create problems of water runoff or erosion on the site or on neighboring sites or pollution of\nsurface water or groundwater. Insofar as possible, natural drainage courses and swales shall be properly\nstabilized and drainage-impounding-areas shall be utilized to dispose of water on the site through natural\npercolation to a degree equivalent to that prior to development.
