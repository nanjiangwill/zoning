The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including\nmaintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and\nwater systems, and streets and bridges.\n8. Variances shall only be used upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary\nto afford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a\ndetermination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic\ncharacter and design of the building and result in the loss of historic designation of the\n58\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "building. Variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A properly\nissued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics SO unusual\nthat complying with the regulation would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or\nthe surrounding landowners. Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not\nbe shared by adjacent parcels. For example, economic or financial hardship is not sufficient\ncause for a variance, nor are inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps,\npersonal preferences or disapproval of one's neighbors.\n9. Variances shall only be used upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a\ndetermination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and (iii)\na determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,\nadditional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, damage the\nrights or property values of other persons in the area, cause fraud on or victimization of the\npublic, or conflict with existing local laws, ordinances or regulations. Only hardships that\nare based on unusual or unique physical characteristics of the property in question,\ncharacteristics that are not shared by adjacent parcels, shall qualify to meet subsection (ii)\nabove. Claims of hardship based on the structure, on economic gain or loss, or on personal\nor self-created circumstances are not sufficient cause for the granting of a variance.\n10. No variance may be issued within a regulatory floodway that will result in any increase in the\n100-year flood levels. A variance may be issued for new construction, substantial\nimprovements and other development necessary for the conduct of a \"functionally dependent\nuse\" provided that there is good and sufficient cause for providing relief; and the variance\ndoes not cause a rise in the 100-year flood level within a regulatory floodway. The structure\nand other development must be protected by methods that minimize flood damages.\n11. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure\nwill be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation\nand the elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the\nincreased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation.\nP. ENFORCEMENT. - The following provisions shall govern with regard to the enforcement of\nthis regulation.\n1. Each Zoning Permit shall authorize, as a condition of approval, the Town Planner or\ndesignated agents to make regular inspections of the subject property.

The\nCommission may require the installation of flags, balloons, or other on-site markers to allow\nevaluation of visual impacts as seen from various vantage points.\n2. That the viability of the area as a wildlife resource (habitat, breeding ground, foraging area,\nmigratory pathway, etc.) is protected. Steps to protect these areas may include, but not be\nlimited to, restricting the size of lawn areas or other clearings; restricting clear cutting to\ncertain seasons of the year or to certain areas, patterns, methods of removal, or other\nrestrictions which may be necessary to minimize the impact on wildlife and wildlife habitats.\nThe Commission may require an analysis of the potential impacts of the proposed activity on\nwildlife to be prepared by an Environmental Specialist or Biologist.\n3.\nThat the groundwater quality and recharge potential of the area is preserved. The\nCommission may require an analysis of the possible impacts of the proposed activity on\ngroundwater quality and recharge. In order to minimize such impacts, the Commission may\nrequire, but not be limited to, restrictions on the size or location of septic systems; the use of\nbiofilters, detention ponds, retention ponds, and other methods of storm water management\nwhich protect surface and subsurface waters; and the regulation of the storage, handling or\nusage of hazardous materials or waste, including, but not limited to, fertilizers, pesticides and\nherbicides.\n4. That areas of archaeological and historic importance have been identified, and adequate steps\nhave been taken to preserve and/or record these areas.\n5. That the stability of the ridgeline is protected and that erosion potential is kept to a minimum\nby minimizing changes to the existing topography, preserving existing vegetation, requiring\nthe revegetation of disturbed areas, and requiring the installation and maintenance of\nsedimentation and erosion control structures as needed. Steps to protect the ridges stability\nmay include, but not be limited to, requiring retaining walls or other methods to minimize the\ncutting and filling of slopes; requiring reforestation or landscaping of quarries upon reaching\nfinished grade, or of other areas disturbed by development or clear cutting; and requiring that\ndriveways, roads, and other improvements requiring grading shall be approximately parallel\nto existing contours.\n6. In reviewing any application for development or earth changes involving a lot of record and\nwithin 75 feet of the Traprock Ridgeline the Commission may allow less than full\ncompliance with the restrictions set forth in this regulation on activities set within said 75\nfoot area where full application of such restrictions would have the effect of precluding\ndevelopment of a principal building on such lot consistent with the size of typical homes in\nthe neighborhood. In addition, in reviewing an application for an accessory structure or use\non a lot of record and within said 75-foot setback area, the Commission may approve such\nstructure or use provided the Commission determines that such application complies with\nSection G 1-5.\nAs a result of applying these criteria, the Commission may alter the proposal in terms of height,\nsize, design, and location and may control the extent and location of any tree clearing and/or\nearth change (grading, etc.).

MIDPOINT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT GUIDELINES\nThe MDD is intended to accommodate appropriately scaled development, to create a design that\nstrengthens the connection between the proposed development, the Farmington Canal Heritage\nTrail and the riverfront area by allowing public access via carefully designed trail systems that\npay respect to the sensitive environmental characteristics of the river and surrounding environs.\nIn addition, this regulation promotes the adaptive re-use of vacant and/or underutilized buildings\nwithin the MDD.\nThe following criteria shall be considered when evaluating a master plan for application of a\nMDD zone to a qualified site:\n1. Plan of Conservation and Development - Consistency and compatibility with the Town's\nPOCD and special area studies contained therein. The only parcels eligible for inclusion in\nthe MDD zone are those specifically identified in the POCD.\n2. Mixed Use - Creative and proactive planning shall integrate complimentary mixed uses and\ncreate a \"sense of place\" where people can live, work, shop and play, thereby reducing\ndependency on the automobile.\n3.

Preservation of the natural Wild and Scenic River corridor by careful placement of\nimprovements into the natural landscape.\nb. Sections 22a-28 through 22a-45d of the Connecticut General Statues and the Inland\nWetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Farmington, as both may be\namended.\nC.\nPromotion of innovative landscaping plans to insure invasive plant species are replaced\nwith indigenous species and require the use of such indigenous species to soften the\nappearance of any development that may be visible from the Farmington River.\nd. The Flood Protection Zone and Flood Perimeter Overlay Zone requirements of the Town\nof Farmington Zoning Regulations, as both may be amended, including adherence to the\nmapping, engineering, and elevation standards found within the Flood Insurance Study,\nvolumes 1-7, and the Federal Insurance Rate Maps both prepared by the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency, as may be amended.\ne. The Aquifer Protection Act of 2006 and the Aquifer Protection Regulations of the Town\nof Farmington, as both may be amended.\nf. Vegetation and Wildlife.

Steps shall be taken including\nappropriate measures to protect endangered and/or species of special concern (flora\nand fauna) and a plan provided to implement mitigation measures as recommended\nby the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\n4. Stormwater. No stormwater shall be discharged directly into the Farmington River or its\ntributaries. The utilization of low impact design (LID) techniques to promote permeability\nand improve water quality is required. Such practices may include a combination of swales, a\nseries of smaller retention areas, raingardens, and subsurface infiltration drainage systems SO\nthat underground infiltration will provide for the treatment of the stormwater, recharge the\naquifer, and will minimize additional removal of the natural landscape. Wherever feasible,\npipe-free solutions shall be designed into the overall stormwater management plan. Such\nefforts are meant to mitigate non-point source pollution, maintain in-stream temperatures and\nwater quality, mimic the natural rate of rainwater infiltration, increase time of on-site\nstormwater concentration, and to provide nutrient uptake. Any such LID measures will be\ndesigned to minimize loss of the natural landscape.\n5. Dynamic and Creative Development. Dynamic and creative layout and use mix that\nrecognizes the history of the site and its buildings, encourages a visual and physical\nconnection to the Farmington River while respecting the Federal Wild and Scenic\ndesignation and at the same time adding value to the area and to the Town of Farmington\noverall by connecting the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail to the site and to other sidewalks\nand pedestrian systems.\nC. APPLICABILITY OF MASTER PLAN/SPECIAL PERMIT\nThe MDD zone may be applied only to those parcels identified within Chapter 9 of the POCD. A\ndecision to apply the MDD zone is a change in zoning for the application site.

NON-COMMERCIAL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS\nA. PURPOSE. The Town of Farmington recognizes that non-commercial wind energy systems may be\nbeneficial to its residents and businesses by providing an alternative source of clean energy. However the\nunregulated design and placement of these systems may result in incompatible land uses, a threat to\nproperty values and the health, safety and welfare of Town residents.\nB. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of applying the provisions of this section the terms below shall be\ndefined as follows:\nMETEOROLOGICAL TOWER - a facility consisting of a tower and related wind\nmeasuring devices, which is used solely to measure winds preliminary to construction of a\nnon-commercial wind energy conversion system.\nNON-COMMERCIAL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM - a facility\nconsisting of some or all of the following: a tower, wind turbine generator with blades, guy\nwires and anchors, and associated control conversion electronic equipment to convert wind\nmovement into electricity, and that is incidental and subordinate to another use on the same\nparcel. A facility shall be considered a non-commercial wind energy conversion system only\nif it supplies electrical power solely for on-site use. However, when a parcel on which a non-\ncommercial wind energy conversion system is installed also receives electrical power\nsupplied by a utility company, any excess electrical power generated by the non-commercial\nwind energy conversion system, and not then needed for on-site use, may be used by the\nutility company in exchange for a reduction in the cost of electrical power supplied by that\ncompany to the parcel for on-site use. No net revenue to the owners shall be produced by\nsuch excess electrical power generation.\nC.\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS. All non-commercial wind energy\nconversion systems shall conform to the following design and locational standards and may\nbe installed in any zoning district following receipt of a special permit.
