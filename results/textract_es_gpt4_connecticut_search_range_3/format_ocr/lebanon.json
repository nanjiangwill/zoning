Introduction\nThe appropriate design of buildings, structures and landscape around Lebanon Green and other areas is\nvalued by its residents. The Design Review Standards have been developed to guide proposed\ndevelopment in the Village Green District (VGD), Village Business District (VBD), and Agricultural Tourist\nVillage (AgTV) Zones and to help ensure that the unique qualities of the landscape are preserved and\nenhanced to everyone's benefit. The Design Review Standards shall serve as the criteria for the review\nand approval of projects for which design review is applicable. The Design Review Standards are intended\nto provide flexibility in the design approaches that may be adopted for each project to achieve the same\noverall public purpose.\nB. Applicability\nDesign review shall be required for all new structures, exterior modifications and changes in use and\nbuildings that require a building permit as determined by the Commission. It is also required for all\nadditions or exterior restoration projects that will change the appearance of a structure, require a building\npermit, and are visible from public vantage points from a public way or civic place such as the Green or\nTown buildings intended for public activities. Design review shall not be required for maintenance, repair\nor replacement projects that do not alter the existing appearance or for interior improvement projects.\nC. Process\n1. Pre-Application. Applicants for building permits within the VGD, VBD, and AgTV Zones should\nconfer with town staff regarding potential applicability of Design Review Standards to their projects\nand associated requirements.\n2. Application. The application for design review shall include site and floor plans, elevations and\nother information to support the discussions with the Design Review Board and be the basis for\napproval.\n3. Review Process. Applicants will meet with the Design Review Board (DRB) to discuss the\nproposed design. The DRB will issue its findings and recommendations, if any, as a report to the\nPlanning and Zoning Commission.\n4. Additional Review. The applicant may request the opportunity to provide further information or\nalternation to their application prior to the completion of the DRB report, including an extension of\ntime under CGS if necessary to submit additional information to the DRB.\n5. Approval Process. The DRB recommendation will be considered as part of the overall project\napplication for final decision by the Commission and read into the record.\n6. Criteria for Recommendations and Decisions. Both the DRB and the Planning and Zoning\nCommission shall use the Design Review Standards, which are composed of Design Principles\nand Standards, as the entire basis for their findings. The Design Principles articulate overall goals\nfor the design character within the VGD, VBD, and AgTV Zones. The Design Standards describe\npotential approaches to achieving those principles.\n90\n"}, {"page": "92", "text": "Lebanon Zoning Regulations\nAmended through 11/5/2018\nD. Design Principles\n1. Valued Historic Character. Designs should respect the history of the Green which includes\nhistoric buildings and highly valued places. To the greatest extent practical, buildings that have\nbeen designated as contributing to the national Lebanon Green Historic District should be\nrestored to reflect their original architecture. Alterations or renovations to other buildings should\nsimilarly be based on the original styles and architecture. New buildings or major additions may\nreflect or interpret the historic styles in the area but need not attempt to become exact\nreproductions or replicas.\n2.\nBalance of Rural Village Center. Designs for any component of VGD, VBD, and AgTV Zones\nshould appear to be in balance with, rather than predominate over, its neighbors. This is a rural\nvillage center with well-balanced uses and activities that include active farming, traditional\nbuildings, fences, stone walls and open space associated with housing, civic uses and clusters of\nbusinesses. Nothing should be so large and predominant as to overwhelm its neighbors.\n3.\nValue of Varied Landscape. The varied landscape quality should be retained and not\ncompromised by large-scale changes that shift the perception of the district as a whole. The\nGreen is a relatively open and varied landscape of fields and lawns, simple paths and clustered\ntrees punctuated by special gardens and features that are neither repetitive nor uniform from one\nparcel or place to the next.\n4.\nContext and Diversity of Building Types and Styles. The architecture of the district has emerged\nover hundreds of years and represents a sequence of building types and styles linked to the eras\nin which they were created. This pattern should continue into the future. See Subsection F. for\nmore on \"Context\".\n5. Non-automobile Environment. The location and design of parking areas should limit the visual\nimpact of the automobile. Parking is a practical need, but the more dominant character of the\nlandscape and an emphasis on pedestrian connections and access should be the dominant\nimage, rather than large areas of paving or asphalt.\nE. Design Standards\n1. Site Layout and Organization\na) Create landscaped space between the street and the buildings that serves as a foreground.\nb)\nWhere there are multiple uses or building components on a site create a hierarchy of buildings\nrather than repeating the same size and orientation of buildings. The hierarchy should include\ndifferent sizes and shapes that distinguish between the primary building and separate\nsecondary components.\nc) Locate significant accessory or companion buildings to the side or rear of the main structure\nor building on the site. Principle buildings should not be substantially concealed by secondary\nor accessory buildings directly in front of them.\nd) Provide significant facades facing the street. Buildings within the district traditionally face a\nstreet with a significant fa\u00e7ade, often including an entrance. Even if the entrance is from the\nside or rear, the facades from the street should have prominent \"fronts.\"\n91\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "Lebanon Zoning Regulations\nAmended through 11/5/2018\n92\nCELL (1, 1): \ne) Locate parking in secondary rather than prominent locations.

Spacing buildings\nCELL (3, 2): \ng) Provide landscape space between buildings that are on different parcels.

Site and Landscape Design\na) Use fence and walls for practical purposes. In an agricultural and village landscape, walls and\nfences serve practical purposes such as separating parcels and enclosing special places and\nuses, or separating pedestrian areas from vehicle areas. They should not be employed\nprimarily as site decoration. Fences erected between the building setback line and the street\nline should not be more than four (4) feet in height and should not be more than one-half (1/2)\nsolid, and stone walls should not be more than three (3) feet in height.\nb) Vary the landscape. Except for agricultural plantings, the planted landscape should be varied\nand avoid repetitive patterns or symmetry unless it is appropriate to the architectural tradition\nof the buildings on the site. Native plantings should be used.\nc) Screen mechanical equipment and dumpsters. Except for equipment directly associated with\nagricultural operations, all dumpsters, ground or concrete pad-mounted mechanical\nequipment should be concealed from public view using evergreen plant materials\ncomplementary to the landscaping or architectural detailing complementary to the building.\n4. Signage Design\na) Limit size and number of signs. The overall size and number of signs should be limited to\nclearly and visibly convey the name of the establishment, institution or use and the character\nof the goods or services being offered from street approaches rather than expanding to\nbecome repetitive advertising.\nb)\nLocate signage to complement the architecture and site design. The signage should be\nintegrated into the overall site design and should be complementary in colors and materials\nwith the buildings and landscape.\nc) Avoid blocking views to historic buildings or features. Signs should not significantly interfere\nwith clear and desirable views of historic buildings or features.\nF. Context\nThe design of new construction, substantial rehabilitations, exterior modifications or changes in use\nshould take into account its \"context\". The context includes the characteristics of the site, any existing\nbuildings and the relationship to neighboring areas. For many buildings and sites around Lebanon Green,\nthe context includes an architectural heritage. Although there are many historical components within the\narea, they represent very different styles as they were created in different periods. In keeping with this\ndiversity, the design guidelines are not intended to be employed to restrict design to a particular period or\nstyle. Rather, the design should take on a character and style that is appropriate to the site, existing\nbuildings and overall zoning district.\nAs part of the design and pre-application process, applicants should identify the style of any buildings that\nthey anticipate renovating or expanding, including important architectural characteristics. They should\nalso take photos of adjacent or nearby prominent buildings and consider whether or not the architectural\nstyle or other characteristics should be a direct influence on their project. This information will be helpful\nin creating a basis for both the design approach and subsequent discussions with the Design Review\nBoard.\nThe following are the variety of styles and architectural characteristics that help compose the VGD and\nVBD Zones. New construction, renovation or substantial improvement to property should be in line with\nthe following styles.\n93\n"}, {"page": "95", "text": "Lebanon Zoning Regulations\nAmended through 11/5/2018\nPostmedieval English 1600-1700, occasionally until ca 1740.\nPostmedieval houses are generally wood framed with a\ncentral chimney and steeply pitched roof. Earlier examples\nare often asymmetrical; later houses may be symmetrical.\nThe original small, diamond-paned windows were almost\nalways replaced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Original doors\nwere typically batten doors, which are simple wooden doors\nconstructed of vertical boards.\nGeorgian 1700-1780, occasionally until ca. 1830.\nThe typical Georgian house in this area is symmetrical in\nform, often 5 bays wide with a central entrance and clap-\nboard siding. The roof is pitched but not as steep as post-\nmedieval houses. Windows are double-hung. They usually\nhave 9 or 12 lights in each sash and thicker muntins - strips\nof wood or metal separating panes of glass - than in later\nperiods. Doors are paneled, often flanked with pilasters, which\nare columns built into or applied to the wall. Windows such\nas transom lights or fanlights are often above the door, and\nsometimes a low-pitched triangle gable known as a pediment\nembellishes doors. There are often ornamental brackets\nknown as modillion course (dentil molding) at the cornice.\nFederal 1780-1830, occasionally until ca. 1840.\nThe Federal house form is similar to Georgian: symmetrical\nand usually 5 bays wide with a central entrance, with a lower\nroof pitch. Double-hung windows are typically 6-over-6 sash,\nwith larger glass panes and more delicate muntins. Doors\nare paneled, often with elaborate, delicately-detailed\nsurrounds (e.g. pediments, fanlights, pilasters and sidelights).\nThere is often a modillion course (dentil molding) or other\ndecoration at cornice. It is also known as the Adam style.\nGreek Revival 1820-1860\nMany Greek Revival houses have a front gabled roof and a\nlower side wing. Roof pitches are generally shallow. Doors\nare paneled and often surrounded by transom lights and\nsidelights with a delicate framework and set into an elaborate\nentablature. Porch columns may be Doric, Ionic, Corinthian\nor vernacular interpretations of classical orders. There are\noften pilasters at building corners and wide cornices at both\nmain roofs and porch roofs. Windows are double-hung, with\n6-over-6 sash.\n94\n"}, {"page": "96", "text": "Lebanon Zoning Regulations\nAmended through 11/5/2018\nQueen Anne 1880-1910\nQueen Anne buildings are characterized by variety in form\nand surface textures. They are usually but not always\nasymmetrical - sometimes with one full-width front gable but\noften with cross gables at the same or lower height. Turrets\n- which are small towers projecting from a building wall -\nand bay windows are common, along with first floor\nporches, patterned shingles and decorative trim. Door and\nwindow surrounds tend to be simpler; window glass is often\n1-over-1, sometimes with smaller panes on one or more\nsides. Often seen as well are 2-over-2 sash windows.\nDoors often have a large pane of glass set into the upper\nportion. The Queen Anne style is often called \"Victorian\".\nColonial Revival 1880-1955 and beyond.\nThis style is eclectic, mixing forms and details from several\nearlier styles, including Dutch Colonial, Georgian and\nFederal. Forms are typically but not always symmetrical.\nDoors often feature large entry-ways and are surrounded by\ncolumns or pilasters. Windows are often 6-over-1 or 6-over-\n6 (often paired). Roofs are usually side gable but\noccasionally gambrel, which is a roof design with a double\nslope on each side.\nVernacular Barns and Farm Buildings\nBarn and farm buildings are utilitarian in nature, usually\nlacking the stylistic details of domestic architecture. What\nthey lack in detail they often make up in graceful proportions\nand a simple graceful aesthetic. Older barns are generally\ntimber framed, often with vertical sheathing. \"English\" barns\nused throughout the 17th and 18th centuries have their main\nentrance on side gable walls and lower-pitched roofs.\nWindows were rare in barns of this type.\n20th Century Vernacular Barns\nBy around 1820 some New England farmers were adopting\n\"Yankee\" barns. They have a steeper roof, and the main\ndoor is located in the gable end. In the mid 19th century,\nclapboard siding became popular, along with a transition\nfrom large pairs of hinged doors to sliding doors. A variety of\nsingle and double hung windows were used throughout the\n19th century. In addition, 6-over-6 windows were common\nand sometimes salvaged during renovations of farm houses.\nBy 1890, 2-over-2 sash was sometimes seen. Balloon\nframing gradually began to replace post-and-beam\nconstruction beginning in the late 19th century. The use of\ngambrel roofs began in the late 19th century and continued\nthrough the 20th century.\n95\n"}], "town": "lebanon"}
