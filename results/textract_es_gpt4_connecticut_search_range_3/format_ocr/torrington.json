These regulations attempt to\nmanage those needs and balance them with the City's overall need to maintain its\ncharacter, ensure the safety of its citizens and create visual harmony within the\ncommunity.\nThe purpose of a sign is to provide information about various services and goods, as well\nas communicate messages that are fundamental to the welfare of the public (e.g. traffic\nsigns). Because of possible harmful impacts, signs must be regulated to:\n1. Prevent hazards to automobile and pedestrian traffic by regulating size, height,\nlocation and number of signs.\n2. Ensure clarity and legible content.\n3. Complement the overall character of the City of Torrington.\n4. Support both businesses and community by making services and goods easily\naccessible.\n5.15.2 Definitions:\nBanner - Any sign of lightweight fabric or similar flexible material that is securely mounted\nto a building or structure. Banners must be securely mounted and cannot be mounted by\nrope, string or other method of tie that would allow the banner to flap or come loose. A\nbanner shall count in the calculation of maximum sign total for a property whether used for\ntemporary purposes or not.\nBillboard - A very large board erected by the roadside or attached to a building, used for\ndisplaying advertisements.

It is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage\nwhere the signal is less than -95dbm, as long as the signal regains its strength to greater\nthan or equal to -95dbm further away from the base station. For the limited purpose of\ndetermining whether the use of a repeater is necessary or desirable, there shall be\ndeemed not to be adequate coverage within said holes. The outer boundary of the area\nof adequate coverage, however, is that location past which the signal does not regain\nstrength of greater than or equal to -95dbm.\nAdequate Capacity. - Capacity is considered to be \"adequate\" if the Grade of Service\n(GOS) is p.05 or better for median traffic levels offered during the typical busy hours, as\nassessed by direct measurement of wireless communication facility in question.
