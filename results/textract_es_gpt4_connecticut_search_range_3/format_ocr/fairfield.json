For the purpose of this definition \"substantial improvement\" is\nconsidered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other\nstructural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration\naffects the external dimensions of the structure. The term shall include the\ncumulative cost of any repairs, reconstruction or improvement for which less\nthan one year has transpired between issuance of a certificate of occupancy\nand the issuance of a subsequent permit. The term does not, however, include\neither (1) any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing\nstate or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been\npreviously identified by the local code enforcement official and which are\nthe minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of\na structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a\nState Inventory of Historic Places, provided that the alteration will not\npreclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.\n144\n"}, {"page": "154", "text": "j.j.
