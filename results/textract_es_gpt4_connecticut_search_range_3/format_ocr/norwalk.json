Purpose and intent.\n(1) The purpose of this regulation is to protect Norwalk's highest concentration of\nmarine industries by preserving and enhancing existing water-dependent land uses\nand encouraging development which is compatible with the area's role as an\nactive commercial harbor. The retention of existing boatyards, marinas and\nrecreational and commercial fishing enterprises is essential to ensure that existing\nnavigational channels are maintained and to preserve Norwalk's role as a seaport\ncommunity and a regional port facility. The proximity of active navigational\nchannels providing access to Long Island Sound render the property within this\ndistrict suitable for all types of water-dependent uses. Mixed use developments,\nsuch as complexes of offices, restaurants, shops, parks, promenades and\nresidences, which contribute to the preservation and enhancement of these water-\ndependent uses and which comply with established waterfront design guidelines\nare allowed by Special Permit.\n(2) In addition, the regulation seeks to encourage strong linkages between the\nwaterfront and the South Norwalk Business District. The provision of public\naccess along the water's edge and the development of complimentary uses and\nactivities on the waterfront will serve to integrate the area with the Washington\nStreet Historic District, the Maritime Center and adjacent residential\nneighborhoods. Within East Norwalk, the regulation seeks to promote the unified\ndevelopment of Cove Marina, SO called, in a manner compatible with the Marina,\nrestaurant and other existing uses as well as the recreational uses on adjacent\nparkland.
