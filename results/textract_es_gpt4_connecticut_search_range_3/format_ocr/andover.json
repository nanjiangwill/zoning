Policy\n1. The Town of Andover seeks to maintain the natural environment of its watercourses\nand water bodies, to control pollution caused by stormwater runoff, and to control\nflooding caused by development.\n2. The Town encourages innovative solutions and low impact development techniques.\nB. Principles\nThese Stormwater Management Standards are intended to incorporate the following\ngoals as reflected in the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, as amended:\n1. Preserve pre-development site hydrology (including runoff, infiltration, interception,\nevapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and stream base flow) to the extent\npossible.\n2. After construction has been completed and the site is permanently stabilized, reduce\nthe average annual total suspended solids loading in the post-development runoff\n"}, {"page": "45", "text": "by at least 80 percent of pre-treatment conditions. For high quality receiving waters\nand sites with the highest potential for significant pollutant loadings, reduce post-\ndevelopment pollutant loadings so that average annual post-development loadings\ndo not exceed pre-development loadings (i.e., no net increase).\n3. Preserve and protect wetlands, stream buffers, natural drainage systems, and other\nnatural features that provide water quality and quantity benefits.\n4. Manage runoff velocity and volume in a manner that maintains or improves the\nphysical and biological character of existing drainage systems and prevents increases\nin downstream flooding/stream bank erosion.\n5. Prevent pollutants from entering receiving waters and wetlands in amounts that\nexceed the systems' natural ability to assimilate the pollutants and provide the\ndesired functions.\n6. Seek multi-objective benefits (i.e., flood control, water quality, recreation, aesthetics,\nand habitat) from stormwater control measures.\nII.\nDefinitions\nAquifer\nA porous water-bearing formation of permeable rock, sand or gravel capable of yielding\neconomically significant quantities of groundwater.\nBest Management Practice (BMP)\nA BMP is a technique, process, activity, or structure used to reduce the pollutant content of\na storm water discharge. BMPs include simple nonstructural methods, such as good\nhousekeeping and preventive maintenance. BMPs may also include structural modifications,\nsuch as the installation of bioretention measures. BMPs are most effective when used in\ncombination with each other, and customized to meet the specific needs (drainage,\nmaterials, activities, etc.) of a given operation or site.\nBioretention\nA practice to manage and treat stormwater runoff by using a specially designed planting soil\nbed and planting materials to filter runoff stored in a shallow depression. The areas consist\nof a mix of elements each designed to perform different functions in the removal of\npollutants and attenuation of stormwater runoff.\nCatch Basin Inserts\n"}, {"page": "46", "text": "A structure, such as a tray, basket, or bag that typically contains a pollutant removal\nmedium (i.e. filter media) and a method for suspending the structure in the catch basin.\nThey are placed directly inside of existing catch basins where stormwater flows into the\ncatch basin and is treated as it passes through the structure.\nCatch Basin\nA structure placed below grade to conduct water from a street or other paved surface to the\nstorm sewer.\nCisterns\nContainers that store larger quantities of rooftop stormwater runoff and may be located\nabove or below ground. Cisterns can also be used on residential, commercial, and industrial\nsites. See also Rain Barrel.\nDisturbance\nAny clearing, grubbing, filling, grading, excavating, constructing, depositing, or removing\nmaterial that could leave the ground surface subject to the potential for accelerated erosion\nor an increase in the rate of runoff.\nDeep Sump Catch Basins\nStorm drain inlets that typically include a grate or curb inlet and a sump to capture trash,\ndebris and some sediment and oil and grease. Also known as an oil and grease catch basin.\nDry Detention Pond\nStormwater basin designed to capture, temporarily hold, and gradually release a volume of\nstormwater runoff to attenuate and delay stormwater runoff peaks. Dry detention ponds\nprovide water quantity control (peak flow control and stream channel protection) as\nopposed to water quality control. Also known as \"dry ponds\" or \"detention basins\".\nFilter Strip\nA strip or area of vegetation for removing sediment, organic material, nutrients and\nchemicals from runoff or wastewater. They are typically located downgradient of\nstormwater outfalls and level spreaders to reduce flow velocities and promote infiltration\nand filtration.\nGrass Drainage Channels\nTraditional vegetated open channels, typically trapezoidal, triangular, or parabolic in shape,\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "whose primary function is to provide non-erosive conveyance, typically up to the 10-year\nfrequency design flow. They provide limited pollutant removal through filtration by grass or\nother vegetation, sedimentation, biological activity in the grass/soil media, as well as limited\ninfiltration if underlying soils are pervious.\nGroundwater Recharge\nThe process by which water seeps into the ground, eventually replenishing groundwater\nacquirers and surface waters such as lakes, streams, and the oceans. This process helps\nmaintain water flow in streams and wetlands and preserves water table levels that support\ndrinking water supplies.\nGroundwater Recharge Volume (GRV)\nThe post-development design recharge volume (on a storm-event basis) required to\nminimize the loss of annual pre-development groundwater recharge. The GRV is determined\nas a function of annual pre-development recharge for site-specific soils or surficial materials,\naverage annual rainfall volume, and amount of impervious cover on a site. The post-\ndevelopment design recharge volume (on a storm-event basis) is required to be equivalent\nto the loss of annual pre-development groundwater recharge. The GRV is determined as a\nfunction of annual pre-development recharge for site-specific soils or surficial materials,\naverage annual rainfall volume, and amount of impervious cover on a site.\nHydrodynamic Separators\nA group of stormwater treatment technologies designed to remove large particle total\nsuspended solids and large oil droplets, consisting primarily of cylindrical-shaped devices\nthat are designed to fit in or adjacent to existing stormwater drainage systems. The most\ncommon mechanism used in these devices is vortex-enhanced sedimentation, where\nstormwater enters as tangential inlet flow into the side of the cylindrical structure. As the\nstormwater spirals through the chamber, the swirling motion causes the sediments to settle\nby gravity, removing them from the stormwater.\nImpervious Surface\nAn area of a lot which has been improved in such a way as to be impenetrable by surface\nwater. Such surfaces include, but are not limited to, roofs, paved areas (roads, driveways,\nparking lots, sidewalks, patios, etc.) and swimming pools.\nInfiltration Practices\nStormwater treatment practices designed to capture stormwater runoff and infiltrate it into\nthe ground over a period of days, including infiltration trenches and infiltration basins.\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "Low Impact Development (LID)\nLow impact development is a site design strategy intended to maintain or replicate\npredevelopment hydrology through the use of small-scale controls integrated throughout\nthe site to manage runoff as close to its source as possible.\nNonpoint Source Pollution\nPollution caused by diffuse sources that are not regulated as point sources and are normally\nassociated with precipitation and runoff from the land.\nNon-Routine Maintenance\nCorrective measures taken to repair or rehabilitate a Stormwater Facility to proper working\ncondition. Non-routine maintenance is performed as needed, typically in response to\nproblems detected during routine maintenance and inspections.\nOil/Particle Separators\nConsist of a subsurface structure with one or more chambers designed to remove trash and\ndebris and to promote sedimentation of coarse materials and separation of free oil (as\nopposed to emulsified or dissolved oil) from stormwater runoff. Oil/particle separators are\ntypically designed as off-line systems for pre-treatment of runoff from small impervious\nareas, and therefore provide minimal attenuation of flow. Also called oil/grit separators,\nwater quality inlets, and oil/water separators.\nPermeable Paving Materials\nMaterials that are alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces and that are designed to\nincrease infiltration and reduce stormwater runoff and pollutant loads. Alternative materials\ninclude modular concrete paving blocks, modular concrete or plastic lattice, cast-in-place\nconcrete grids, and soil enhancement technologies. Stone, gravel, and other low-tech\nmaterials can also be used as alternative for low traffic application such as driveways, haul\nroads, and access roads.\nPorous Pavement\nPorous pavement is similar to conventional asphalt or concrete but is formulated to have\nmore void space for greater water passage through the material.\nPretreatment\n"}, {"page": "49", "text": "Techniques used in stormwater management to provide storage and removal of coarse\nmaterials, floatables, or other pollutants before the primary treatment practice.\nPrimary Stormwater Treatment Practices\nStormwater treatment practices that are capable of providing high levels of water quality\ntreatment as stand-alone devices: can be grouped into five major categories - stormwater\nponds, stormwater wetlands, infiltration practices, filtering practices, and water quality\nswales.\nRain Barrels\nBarrels designed to retain small volumes of runoff for reuse for gardening and landscaping.\nThey are applicable to residential, commercial, and industrial sites and can be incorporated\ninto a site's landscaping plan. The size of the rain barrel is a function of rooftop surface area\nand the design storm to be stored. Rain barrels capture runoff that would otherwise be lost\nto storm drains, divert water to the landscape, and conserve tap water. For large rain\nbarrels, see \"Cistern.\"\nRain Garden\nFunctional landscape elements that combine plantings and a specially designed planting soil\nbed in depressions that allow water to pool for only a few days after a rainfall and then be\nfiltered by and slowly absorbed by the soil and plantings. Rain gardens improve water\nquality by reducing the sediment, nutrients, bacteria, and chemicals from flowing into water\nbodies.\nResponsible Party\nThe person or organization responsible for construction and/or maintenance of a\nstormwater facility.\nRoutine Maintenance\nMaintenance performed on a Stormwater Facility on a regular basis to maintain proper\noperation and aesthetics.\nSecondary Stormwater Treatment Practices\nStormwater treatment practices that may not be suitable as stand-alone treatment because\nthey are either not capable of meeting the water quality treatment performance criteria or\nhave not yet received the thorough evaluation needed to demonstrate the capabilities for\nmeeting the performance criteria.\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "Site Stormwater Management Plan\nA Plan in accordance with Section III below describing the potential water quality and\nquantity impacts associated with a development project both during and after construction.\nIt also identifies selected source controls and treatment practices to address those potential\nimpacts, the engineering design of the treatment practices, and maintenance requirements\nfor proper performance of the selected practices.\nStormwater\nWater consisting of precipitation runoff or snowmelt.\nStormwater Runoff\nAbove ground water flow resulting from precipitation or snow melts.\nStormwater Facility\nAny device, structure, system, or practice used to improve stormwater quality, promote\ninfiltration, provide peak flow control, or to provide peak runoff attenuation.\nStormwater Ponds\nVegetated ponds that retain a permanent pool of water and are constructed to provide both\ntreatment and attenuation of stormwater flows.\nStormwater Treatment Practices\nDevices constructed for primary treatment, pretreatment or secondary treatment of\nstormwater.\nStormwater Treatment Train\nStormwater treatment practices, as well as site planning techniques and source controls,\ncombined in series to enhance pollutant removal or achieve multiple stormwater objectives.\nStormwater Wetlands\nShallow, constructed pools that capture stormwater and allow for the growth of\ncharacteristic wetland vegetation.
