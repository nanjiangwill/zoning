Three site plans of the premises drawn to scale not smaller than one hundred (100) feet to the\ninch and certified by a licensed surveyor or civil engineer showing the existing shape and dimensions\nof\nthe lot, the location and size of all existing and proposed structures and land uses, existing and proposed\ntopography, the flood plain limits and elevations. Any other information requested by the Planning and\nZoning Commission or their appointed agents shall also be provided. The Planning & Zoning\nCommission or its agent shall record with all flood plain permits, the as-built elevation (in relation to\nmean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement), or dry flood proofing of any new or substantially\nimproved structures; and where required by these regulations, all engineering certifications shall be\nmaintained with the permit.\n2. No filling shall be permitted nor shall any building permit be issued until a required Site Plan is\napproved by the Planning and Zoning Commission and signed by the Chairman of said Commission.\n3. If a land owner has altered or is in the process of altering the contours of his property and the\ncontours do not agree with the information as supported by the maps specified in Section 8.12.A., and this\nalteration was accomplished, or is processed, before the approval of this amendment, the land owner shall\nbe required to file copies and receive Commission approval of a Certified Site Plan showing the new\ntopographic contours or proposed contours before continuing his excavating or filling operations.\nE. Manufactured (Mobile) Homes:\nAll existing, non-conforming manufactured (mobile) homes situated on a flood plain shall if replaced\nor substantially improved have:\n1. Stands or lots elevated on compacted fill or on pilings SO that the lowest floor of the mobile\nhome will be at least two (2) feet above the flood level; and\n2. Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler provided; and\n3. In the instance of elevation on pilings, lots large enough to permit steps, piling foundations\nplaced in stable soil no more than 10 feet apart, and reinforcement provided for piers more than six feet\nabove ground level;\n+4. Anchors required, to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement conforming to standards\nrecommended by a licensed engineer, or over-the-top to ground ties be provided at each of the four\ncorners of the manufactured (mobile) home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations\nand manufactured (mobile) homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per side. Frame ties\nshall be provided at each corner of the home with five additional ties per side at intermediate points, and\n53\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "manufactured (mobile) homes less than 50 feet long requiring four additional ties per side. All\ncomponents of the anchoring system shall be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds (lbs) and any\nadditions to the manufactured (mobile) home shall be similarly anchored, and approved by the building\ninspector.\n* Sec. 8.12 Effective 9 October 1981.\n+ Sec. 8.12 Changes in italics effective 8 April 1991.\n8.13 SITE LIGHTING [Revised effective 5/1/18]\nThe purpose of this section is to provide specific guidelines in regard to lighting, in order to maximize the\neffectiveness of site lighting, to enhance public safety and welfare, to avoid unnecessary upward\nillumination of adjacent properties, and to reduce glare. All business, residential and community\nroadways, sidewalks and town property luminaries should be planned and installed with the idea of being\na \"good neighbor\" by keeping unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting properties or roads,\nboth public and private.\nExcept as herein provided, these regulations shall apply to any outdoor lighting fixture installed,\nmodified, refurbished, repaired or serviced within the Town of Chaplin, CT. This regulation shall apply to\nall sites located in nonresidential zones and special permit uses in residential zones.\nA. DEFINITIONS:\nDIRECT LIGHT : Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or\nthrough the refractor or diffuser lens of a luminaire.\nFULL CUT-OFF TYPE FIXTURE : A luminaire or light fixture which, by design of the housing,\ndoes not allow any light dispersion or direct glare to shine above a 90 degree horizontal plane from the\nbase (or the purpose of the design is defeated, and disability glare will result).\nFULLY SHIELDED LIGHTS : Fully shielded luminaire light fixtures allow control of the glare in\nany direction.\nGLARE : Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to\nsee, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness.\nHEIGHT OF LUMINAIRES : The height of luminaires shall be the vertical distance from the\nground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the\nluminaire.\nINDIRECT LIGHTING Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.\nISOLUX DIAGRAM : An isolux diagram is a graphical representation of points of equal luminance\ndrawn as single line circular patterns or computer generated spot readings in a grid pattern on a site plan.\n54\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "Lighting designers and manufacturers generate these diagrams to show the level and evenness of a\nlighting design and to show how light fixtures will perform on a given site.\nLAMP : The light source component of luminaires that procedures the actual light.\nLIGHT POLLUTION : Stray or reflected light that is emitted into the atmosphere, beyond the 90-\ndegree horizontal plane. Dust, water, vapor and other pollutants reflect this light causing unwanted sky-\nglow.\nLUMEN : A unit of luminous flux. One-foot candle is one lumen per square foot. For the purpose of this\nregulation, the lumen-output values shall be the initial lumen output ratings of a lamp.\nLUMINAIRE : A complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture.\nOUTDOOR LIGHTING : The night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made\ndevice located outdoors that produces light by any means.\nRATIO : Uniformity ratio, describing the average level of illumination in relation to the lowest level of\nillumination for a given area. Example: U. ratio = 4:1 for the given area, the lowest level of illumination\n(1) should be no less than 1/4 or 4 times less than the average (4) level of illumination.\nUPLIGHTING : Any light source that distributes illumination above a 90 degree horizontal plane.\nB. LIGHTING PLAN\nOutside lighting for non-farm and non-residential/multifamily uses will be subject to a Site Plan review\nand shall be accompanied by a lighting plan showing:\n1. The location, height and type of any outdoor lighting luminaries, including building mounted\nluminaries;\n2. The luminaire manufacturer's specification data, including lumen output and photometric data showing\ncutoff angles;\n3. The Commission may require an isolux plan showing the intensity of illumination expressed in foot\ncandles at ground level;\nC. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. All exterior lights and illuminated signs shall be designed, located, installed and directed in such a\nmanner as to prevent objectionable light at (and glare across,) the property lines and disability glare at\nany\nlocation on or off the property. The maintained horizontal illuminance recommendations set by the\nIllumination Engineering Society of North America (IES) shall be observed.\n55\n"}, {"page": "61", "text": "2. All lighting for parking, public and park pedestrian areas will be full cut-off type fixtures.\n3. Uplighting is prohibited without a special permit. Unless a special permit has been obtained, externally\nlit signs, display, building and aesthetic lighting must be lit from the top and shine downward. The\nlighting must be shielded to prevent direct glare and/or light trespass. The lighting must also be, as much\nas physically possible, contained to the target area.\n4. All building lighting for security or aesthetics will be full cut-off or a fully shielded/recessed type, not\nallowing any upward distribution of light.\n5. [DELETED]\n6. Adjacent to residential property and in all residential zones, no direct light source will be visible at the\nproperty line at ground level or above.\n7. Gasoline Service Stations. Maintained illumination recommendations set by the Illuminating\nEngineering Society of North America will be observed and not exceeded. All area lighting will be full\ncut-off. Lighting under canopy will be recessed SO that the lens is recessed or flush with the bottom\nsurface, to reduce off-site glare for roadways.\n8. [DELETED]\n9. All non-essential lighting will be required to be turned off after business hours, leaving only the\nnecessary lighting for site security - motion or infrared sensor lighting is encouraged. (Non-essential can\napply to display, aesthetic, parking and sign lighting).\n10. The height of luminaries shall be the minimum height necessary to provide adequate illumination. In\ngeneral, luminaries shall not be allowed to exceed a height of 20 feet, however, the Commission may\napprove luminaries of greater height if it is shown that taller luminaries will reduce the total lighting\nrequired or make the lighting less obtrusive.\n11. Exemptions: Traditional seasonal lighting and temporary lighting used by Police and Fire\nDepartments or Emergency services are exempt from these regulations.\nD. SPECIAL PERMITS\nThe Commission may grant a Special Permit modifying the requirements of this Section, provided it\ndetermines that such modification is consistent with the purpose of these regulations.\nARTICLE IX - ADMINISTRATION\n9.1\nEnforcement Officer\nThe Commission shall have an enforcement officer designated by the Commission, and called the Zoning\nOfficer. Compensation of the Zoning Officer shall be determined by the Commission.\n56\n"}, {"page": "62", "text": "9.2\nOfficial Authority\nThe Commission, or person appointed by them, is designated as the official authority with full power to\nenforce these regulations as provided by law. All inspection duties in connection with the enforcement of\nthese regulations shall be performed by any member of the Commission or such person as may be\nappointed by said Commission.\n9.3\nApplication Procedure for a Zoning Permit:\nA. Requirements to Obtain a Permit:\nNo building or structure may be erected, altered or changed in use and no land use may be\ncommenced unless a permit has been granted by the Commission or its appointed agent. All applications\nfor any permit shall be submitted on forms furnished by the Commission and shall be accompanied by the\nfollowing:\n+1.\nA class B Zoning Location Survey plot plan in duplicate, drawn to scale of at least 1\" = 40'\nshowing dimensions, radii and angles of lot size, elevations and locations of driveway, building(s) and\naccessory building(s) built or to be built, the location of sanitary facilities and water supply, and any other\ninformation as required by the Commission and as may be necessary to determine and provide for the\nenforcement of these regulations. The Zoning Officer shall require a plot plan drawn by a Connecticut\nLicensed land surveyor or engineer if there appears that a boundary dispute may result. On large tracts of\nland only the lot boundaries most affected shall be shown as accurate. A 1\":40' scale, class A2 survey\nplot plan is required for any lot of less than two acres for new house construction. A class A2, 1:40 scale\nplot plan is also required when 3/4 of an acre or more of land is disturbed by construction of a house,\ndriveway, well, septic system, and accessory buildings. Zoning officer may waive certain requirements\nif it appears that setbacks are met on 2 or acres or more.\n2. Any revisions or change of information in the requirements of 9.3.A.1 requires written\npermission of the Commission or its appointed agent.\n3. Permits are granted for a period of one year and must be renewed if construction is not\ncompleted.\nB.
