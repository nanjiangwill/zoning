In order\nthat the future Planning Commission may be aware of the intent of the present Commission the following\npoints are made:\nb) The Zones, as presently recommended, reflect present land use, and are intended to reduce non-\nconforming uses to a minimum.\nc) The Zoning Map and Regulations should be reviewed and revised at regular intervals to reflect the\nchanging needs and the best interest of the Town of Middlefield. The Planning Commission is responsible\nto see that such changes are in conformity with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.\nd) The guiding factor in considering changes in zoning is the suitability of the land for the purpose intended,\nwith maximum consideration of material and aesthetic values of present land use and preservation of the\nnatural beauty of the Town of Middlefield.\nThose areas presently zoned as Agricultural may be available in the future for other uses.

However, the Town believes that the need to protect the integrity of its\nresidential areas is of paramount concern. A \"home occupation\" approval is the method used to allow and to\nregulate non-residential activity within the Town's residential districts.\nIn essence, the objective of a \"home occupation\" approval is to allow a limited commercial-type activity in a\nresidential area only to an extent that no neighbors or passersby will be aware, by outward appearance, of the\nactivity. In practice, a \"home occupation\" approval gives the permittee the legal right to use his/her residence or\naccessory structure for a business telephone, business mailing address and related activities, but not to the extent\nthat pedestrian and vehicular traffic are generated that is disruptive to the residential character of the\nneighborhood.\n4.9.2 Standards\na.\nThe occupation is carried on by the residents of the dwelling and with no more than three non-resident\nemployees.\nb. There shall be no external evidence of the operation of the home occupation so as to change the residential\ncharacter of the dwelling, except that one sign of not more than two square feet in area shall be permitted.\nC. The storage of goods, materials or products connected with a home occupation are prohibited outside of\nthe dwelling or accessory buildings.\nd. There shall be no entrance or exit way specifically provided in the dwelling for the conduct of the home\noccupation thereon.\ne.

No\nmore than five (5) parking spaces serving a self-storage facility located in Design Development District #1 shall be\nlocated in the required front yard.\n5.5.3 Site Access\nPoints of access to Route 66 shall be limited to one per property or one every 500 feet of frontage whichever is\ngreater. When two adjacent properties under separate ownership share a single access, each property may receive\na bonus to permit a 30% maximum building coverage and 75% lot coverage; but, in any event, the Commission\nmay require provisions for shared access for any site. Where possible, the use of interior drives parallel to Route\n66 to limit access points is encouraged.\nWhere topographic and other conditions permit, provisions shall be made for circulation driveway connections to\nadjoining lots of similar existing or potential use 1) when such driveway connection will facilitate fire protection\nservices, as approved by the First Selectmen and Town Fire Marshal, or their agents, and/or 2) when such\ndriveway will enable the public to travel between two existing or potential sites, open to the public generally,\nwithout need to travel upon a public street.\n* Developed lots of record as of the effective date of this amendment either non-conforming or approved under the\nPlanned Commercial Regulations shall follow dimensional requirements for Design District 2.\n5.5.4 Landscaping\nThe portions of the site not included within the lot coverage shall be landscaped with grass, trees, shrubs, and\nother appropriate plantings. To the greatest extent possible, landscaped areas shall contain indigenous vegetation\neither as a result of retaining existing vegetation or new plantings.\n5.5.5 Design Guidelines\nAs discussed in 5.5.1 Purpose, a criterion to be addressed in the Route 66 Design District is a design of structures\nwhich is sensitive to the architectural character of Middlefield. Therefore, in addition to the standards of Section\n15 and 16, preferred structural elements include:\nThe use of wood clapboard, brick, and other natural materials for the exterior of structures\nThe use of roof details such as dormers, roof pitches, etc.\nA scale of buildings which are comparable with other buildings on the site and encourage pedestrian\nmovement among the buildings\n57\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "Avoid long, unarticulated structures\nPreferred signage design:\nSigns should be proportioned to the scale of buildings and site\nUse natural materials (stone, brick, or wood)\nIntegrate landscaping with signage where appropriate\n5.5.6 Self-Storage Facilities\nA.

This listing of excluded activities is intended to be illustrative only and not\nexhaustive.\nB. Additional Criteria and Considerations\nIn addition to the site plan and special permit criteria provided in Sections 15 and 16 of these Regulations,\nall self-storage facilities shall meet the following additional criteria and be subject to the following\nconsiderations:\n1. A minimum of 15 percent of all units offered for rent shall be climate- controlled for temperature\nand humidity.\n2.\nA minimum of 50 percent of the floor area of all units offered for rent shall be\nlocated at least two hundred (200) feet back from the public highway line.\n3.\nAll land used as part of a self-storage facility shall front exclusively on a State highway and all\nvehicular access to a self-storage facility shall be exclusively to and from a State highway.\n4. A self-storage facility shall include an on-site office for customer support during established hours\nand the sale of items relating to moving and self-storage. The portion of any building where such\noffice is located shall present the external appearance of a two-story building.\n5. Patron access to a self-storage facility shall only be permitted between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and\n10:00 p.m.\n6. No self-storage facility unit may be interconnected with any other unit except via a common\nhallway or other common accessway.\n7. No water supply or drainage plumbing shall be installed or used in any self- storage unit, except\nas\nreasonably necessary to provide climate control in climate-controlled units.\n8. No more than five (5) delineated parking spaces shall be required at a self-\n9. storage facility. Temporary parking incidental to the loading and/or unloading of a storage unit\nmay take place in areas of driveway proximate to the storage unit being accessed. Access to a self-\nstorage facility may be controlled by an electronically controlled gate or another similar device.\nAny such gate or any associated controls shall be considered a fence or part of a fence.\n10. In order to maintain and promote diversity of uses in the Design Development Districts,\nthe Commission may consider the number of already- existing self-storage facilities in the\nDesign Development District in determining whether to approve an application for additional\nself-storage facilities. No self-storage facility shall be located or operated on a parcel of land less\nthan fifteen (15) acres.\n58\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "11.

Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community.\nMiddlefield, CT has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is\nfounded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community.\nLocal, state, and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives\nof the NFIP. The community's role is of paramount importance.
