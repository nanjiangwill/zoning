(9/15/86;\n9/28/2010)\n(A) Purposes.\nIn addition to the purposes stated in Sec. 6-102, the goal of the LBR zones is to protect and encourage\nneighborhood-oriented retail development. These zones provide central but limited concentration of\ncomplementary retail goods and personal services in convenient locations to meet the frequent recurring\nneeds of nearby residents.\nThe regulations are intended to provide a system of controls which are tailored to the needs of the\nneighborhoods and give priority to neighborhood-serving activities; to control the distribution and\nconcentration of uses so as to avoid a proliferation of ground-floor non-retail uses which may threaten\nthe balance and variety of activities and the viability of the areas' retail function; to discourage a significant\nreduction in the total number of available storefront businesses or a break in storefront continuity, within\na neighborhood commercial district. An additional goal is to encourage housing, where appropriate, so\nas to meet the diverse housing needs of the Town's residents as well as to provide a daytime market that\nsupports and strengthens the business community.\nLBR zones do not depend on areas substantially larger than the neighborhood districts they are\ndesigned to serve and they do not attract a significant part of their clientele from beyond the surrounding\nneighborhood. The scale, design, character and uses of commercial buildings in the zones are intended\nto be compatible with the scale, character and density of surrounding residential areas and to supply\ndesired goods and services, with particular emphasis on reserving an adequate amount of ground-floor\nstorefront space for retail businesses which display and stock goods for sale to consumers.\nThe LBR zone is divided into sub-categories. Most shopping areas can provide comparison goods\nand services on a generalized or specialized basis to a neighborhood market area and in general are\nmore dependent upon pedestrian traffic and storefront exposure. A few shopping areas have less\npotential for comparison goods and services, are less dependent on pedestrian traffic, and are designed\nto provide a limited variety of convenience retail and personal services to the nearby community.\n(B) Parking.\nNotwithstanding other provisions in these regulations, no above-grade parking structure shall be\npermitted. Subject to (C) below, underground parking may be permitted by Special Permit provided that\nparking spaces required for Use Group 8 uses are surface spaces on the same level as street-level\nbusinesses and are located to the rear of the structure, and provided that there is no access to\nunderground parking so as to break the continuity of storefront businesses, and no loss of municipal or\nprivate surface parking presently existing within the district. In considering approval of underground\nparking, the Commission shall consider the character of the area including existing uses, buildings and\nopen spaces; the relationship of the proposal in all its aspects including bulk and mass to the existing\ncharacter and purposes of the business district; the convenience to shoppers; and the impact on\ncontinuity of shopping patterns.\n(C) Height Limitations.\nNotwithstanding other provisions in these regulations, the height of any structure shall not exceed\nthirty-five feet as measured from the grade plane to the highest point of the building. Subject to Special\nPermit, the elements and structures regulated under Sec. 6-127 may be permitted to exceed the height\nestablished in this sub-section 6-103(C).

(3/21/2000)\n(A) Purposes.\nIn addition to the purposes stated in Sec. 6-102, the goal of the LB zone is to provide for greater\nvariety of retail, service, community and business needs. The zone supplies merchandise and services\nfor the nearby residential and business areas, and it serves local consumers from beyond the immediate\nneighborhood because of its central location and its greater flexibility and multiplicity of uses. The LB\nzone is less dependent upon pedestrian traffic and storefront exposure. While the zone serves both the\nsurrounding neighborhoods and the community at large, for the most part it does not seek to attract its\nclientele from beyond the Town. The scale and uses of structures are intended to be compatible with the\ncharacter and density of surrounding areas.\nThis is a multi-functional zone whose primary goals are to protect and encourage neighborhood and\nlocally-oriented retail and personal service development so as to meet the frequent recurring needs of\nnearby residents and businesses, to provide comparison goods and services, and to meet needs for a\nbroader variety of business and community services.\nThe LB zone is designed also to provide for diversity of housing opportunities.
