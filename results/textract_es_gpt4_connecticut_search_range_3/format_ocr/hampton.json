Purpose.\nWithin the zoning districts established by these Regulations or by amendments that may\nlater be adopted there exist lots, uses and structures which were lawful at the time\nthese\nRegulations were adopted or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated or\nrestricted under the provisions of these Regulations or future amendments. Such lots, uses\nand structures are declared by these Regulations to be nonconforming. It is the intent of\nthese Regulations that non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or\nextended if such a change would increase the non-conformity nor be used as grounds for\nadding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone. It is the burden of\nthe owner to provide sufficient documentation to demonstrate that such nonconforming\nuse/structure/lot predated zoning regulations which prohibit such use/structure/lot.\n1. Nonconforming uses are declared by these Regulations to be incompatible with\npermitted uses in the district involved. After the effective date of adoption or\namendment of these Regulations, a nonconforming use, a nonconforming\nstructure or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not\nbe extended or enlarged by the attachment to a building or land of additional signs\nintended to be seen from off the premises or by the addition of other uses of a\nnature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.\n2. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in these Regulations shall be deemed to require\na change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which\nactual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or\namendment of these Regulations and upon which actual building construction has\nbeen carried on diligently. \"Actual construction\" is hereby defined to include the\nplacing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a\npermanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing\nbuilding has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation\nor demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that\nwork shall be carried on diligently.\nB. Nonconforming lots\nIn any district, a principal building and customary accessory buildings may be erected on\na lawful lot existing as of the effective date of adoption or amendment of these\nRegulations. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the lot area\nand/or lot width requirements of the district in which such lot is located, provided that the\nyard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to lot area and/or lot width\nshall conform to the requirements of the district in which such lot is located.\nC. Nonconforming uses\nWhere a lawful use exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these\nRegulations, which use is no longer permitted under these Regulations as adopted or\nARTICLE 6\npage 1\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "ARTICLE 6\namended, such use may be continued SO long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to\nthe following provisions:\n1.

Such nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any portion of\nthe land other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or\namendment of these Regulations.\n3. If such nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, it shall thereafter\nconform to the requirements of the zone in which it is located, and the\nnonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed.\nD. Nonconforming structures\nWhere a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these\nRegulations which could not be built under the provisions of these Regulations as enacted\nor amended by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on\nthe lot or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued SO\nlong as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:\n1. Any nonconforming building or structure which does not contain a\nnonconforming use may have extensions, structural alterations or changes,\nprovided that no other zoning regulations are violated or that the nonconformity is\nnot increased in any manner.\n2. If such nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, act of\nGod or by public enemy, it may be repaired or replaced to an extent which does\nnot increase the nonconformity. Such repair or replacement shall commence\nwithin twelve (12) months after the damage or destruction occurs and shall be\ncompleted within twenty-four (24) months after commencement. If such repair or\nreplacement is not accomplished within such time periods, the structure shall be\nreconstructed in conformity with the requirements of the zone in which it is\nlocated.\n3. If such structure is moved for any reason for any distance whatsoever, it shall\nthereafter conform to the requirements of the zone in which it is located after it is\nmoved.\nE. Nonconforming uses of structures and land in combination\nWhere a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the\neffective date of adoption or amendment of these Regulations which is no longer\npermitted under the provisions of these Regulations as enacted or amended, such lawful\nuse may be continued SO long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following\nprovisions:\n1. Any existing structure devoted to such nonconforming use shall not be enlarged,\nextended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered in a manner\nwhich increases the nonconformity, except to change the use of the structure to a\nuse permitted in the zone in which it is located.\n2.

Dependent on the nature\nand location of the proposed development, minor land disturbing activities, proposed\naccessory structures and minor additions may be authorized through the issuance of\nZoning Permits, while major land disturbing activities, proposed primary structures and\nmajor additions shall necessitate special permit approval of the Commission. This\nregulation also formally recognizes the current Town's Flood Insurance Program, and\nFlood Insurance Rate Maps.\nFor the purpose of this regulation, all definitions shall be in accordance with those\ncontained in the current National Flood Insurance Program Rules and Regulations, which\nare available in the Hampton Town Hall.\nB. Procedure\nPrior to the commencement of any development in designated flood hazard zones A1\nthrough A15 and unnumbered A zones, an application with accompanying information\nshall be submitted to the Commission for its review. Application shall only be received\nat a regular meeting of the Commission or submitted to its agent. To promote expedient\nreview, applications should be filed in the Planning Office at least seven days prior to a\nregular meeting for analysis and placement on the agenda. Upon receipt of the\napplication, the Commission shall review the proposal and determine whether special\npermit approval or zoning permit authorization is appropriate. Prior to this\ndetermination, all proposals under this regulation shall be considered special permit\napplications.\nIf the proposal involves a minor land disturbing activity, accessory structure or minor\naddition which is clearly consistent, the Commission may authorize the Zoning\nEnforcement Officer to issue a Zoning Permit. All other proposed activities shall require\nspecial permit approval and a public hearing date shall be established. After conducting\nthe public hearing, the Commission shall complete its review and approve, approve with\nmodification, or disapprove the application.\nARTICLE 6\npage 15\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "ARTICLE 6\nAll statutory time requirements for special permit applications shall be followed.\nEnforcement shall be in accordance with the appropriate sections of the Connecticut\nGeneral Statutes and the Hampton Zoning Regulations.
