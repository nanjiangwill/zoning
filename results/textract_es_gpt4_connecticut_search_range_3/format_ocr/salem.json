This natural\nresource is essential to residential, business, governmental, and institutional interests\nalike. In Salem, all water is taken from wells dug or drilled into saturated earth strata or\ninto fractured bedrock. Such sources are generally referred to as groundwater.\nGroundwater percolates from the earth's surface into the underlying strata, and its quality\nis dependent on the extent to which it remains uncontaminated by elements added to it or\nmaterials through which it must pass. Consequently, groundwater quality is influenced\nprimarily by the use of the land at the surface. All of the liquid discharges from surface\nuse, such as the runoff from parking lots, the effluent from sewage disposal systems, and\naccidental chemical spills, enter the same geologic formations from which we derive our\ndrinking water. Since the flow of groundwater is measured in inches per day, by the time\ncontamination is discovered, it is usually too late for corrective action. Water quality in\nunderground sources can be protected only by exercising care in all activities that occur\nin the areas where the water and other liquids enter the ground. This is the reason for\ngroundwater protection regulations.\nIt is the purpose of these Regulations to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of\nthe residents of the Town of Salem by protecting the existing and potential groundwater\nsupplies within the Town of Salem from contamination due to discharges of hazardous\nmaterials.\nAuthority for promulgating these Regulations is found in Section 8-2 of the Connecticut\nGeneral Statutes, which states, in part: \"Zoning Regulations shall be made with\nreasonable consideration for the protection of existing and potential public surface and\nground drinking water supplies.\"\n25.2\nDEFINITION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS\nHazardous material means any substance or combination of substances which, because of\nquantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics, poses\na\nsignificant present or potential hazard to water supplies or to human health if disposed\ninto or on any land or water, including groundwater.

These features are a key component\nof the largely intact watersheds and natural character of Salem. In order to preserve a fully\nfunctioning aquatic system in the Eightmile River Watershed and to prevent damage to the\ncritical buffer area around its water bodies, the Riparian Corridor Overlay Zone is hereby\nestablished.

Protection of a vegetated buffer around watercourses is crucial for public\nhealth, safety, and welfare because the buffer regulates water flow, preserves diversity and\nabundance of wildlife species and habitat, protects water quality and maintains important cultural\nand historic features of the Town.
