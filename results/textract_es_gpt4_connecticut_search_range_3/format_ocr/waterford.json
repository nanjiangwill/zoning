Moreover, these\nsites offer prospects to foster sustainable and environmentally responsible development and provide\nprotection to adjoining neighborhoods in a manner consistent with policies, goals, and objectives\noutlined within the Plan of Conservation and Development (POCD), as amended. Accordingly, the\nCommission hereby creates the Planned Design District (PDD) to provide an alternative to the\ntraditional development of these properties under their existing zoning designation.\n19.1.2 The approval of a PDD constitutes a change in zone and will be a floating zone governed by a Master\nDesign Plan in accordance with these regulations. Any substantial or material change to an approved\nMaster Design Plan, as defined herein, shall be subject to the same review and public hearing\nprocedures as the original zone change. Once enacted, the PDD will supersede all pre-existing\nzoning, and any development on the rezoned property will be subject to the approved Master Design\nPlan and these PDD regulations.\n19.2\nESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICT\n19.2.1 The Commission shall establish the PDD by approving a Master Design Plan, which while not\nintended to be a substitute for detailed documentation associated with a site plan, provides sufficient\ninformation to determine whether the proposal is in conformance with the purpose of the PDD and\nis consistent with the POCD. Such adoption shall constitute a zoning map amendment in accordance\nwith Section 28 of these Regulations.\n19.2.2 Additions and Alterations. Any addition or alteration to the Master Design Plan must conform with\nthe purpose of the PDD and remain consistent with the POCD. Furthermore, any addition or\nalteration, which, in the discretion of the Commission, constitutes a substantial or material change,\nshall be subject to the same review and public hearing procedures as the original zone change. A\nsubstantial or material change shall include, but shall not be limited to, any revision, extension,\nenlargement, movement or other change in the proposed development of the site which results in\nincreasing the total amount of approved coverage by more than 25%, increasing the total approved\nheight of any building by more than 20%, reducing the approved relationship between the amount\nof building area and the amount of parking to be provided, reducing the total amount of approved\nlandscaped area by more than 10%, locating any building closer to an adjacent property or street\nline than that which is approved, or reducing the size of or changing in any way the location of any\napproved intersection or driveway connection with a public street.\n19.2.3\nDistrict Eligibility. To be eligible for the PDD designation a site must: (1) encompass one or more\ncontiguous parcels of land totaling four (4) acres or more in gross area; (2) have the ability to connect\nto a public water supply and municipal sanitary sewer; and (3) be located in a commercial,\nindustrial, or multi-family district or may include residentially zoned land that is adjacent to said\ncommercial, industrial, or multi-family district provided that the amount of residentially zoned land\ndoes not exceed 25% of the total area of the proposed PDD.\n19.2.4\nNumbering of Districts.

The objective of\ninformal staff meetings and preliminary staff review is not to evaluate detailed site plan applications. The\nintent is to allow town staff to assist an applicant in understanding town requirements for formal\napplications based upon a single proposed development program. To assist the applicant in making site\nplan and special permit applications the outcome of informal staff meetings and preliminary staff review\nwill attempt to address the following:\na) Review the zoning district(s) the subject property resides within\nb) Determine the appropriate type of land use classification\nc) Based upon land use, provide direction for the type of permit application(s) required\nd) Provide direction to applying appropriate sections of the regulations (i.e. bulk standards, parking,\nlandscaping, lot design, etc.)\ne) Review conceptual design of site layout, grading, stormwater management and building design to\nprovide general direction associated with applying applicable regulations to the proposed application\nIn addition, an applicant may request a pre-application review meeting with the Commission. The purpose\nof a pre-application is to introduce a plan or use and receive non-binding input from the Commission. This\nmay be beneficial for both the Commission and applicant, particularly for more complex or unique\ndevelopment scenarios.\nParticipation in any of the above and the level of review provided is at the discretion of the Commission or\nits Agent.\nAt anytime there is a discrepancy in interpreting the zoning regulations between the applicant and staff or\nCommission, the applicant has the right to request an interpretation of any part of these zoning regulations\nfrom the Zoning Board of Appeals.\n22a.2\nPRE-APPLICATION REVIEW FOR USE OF PROPERTY AND RIGHT TO FILE\nAPPLICATION\nAll Pre-application Review procedures are subject to the provisions of CGS Sec. 7-159b.\nThe applicant has the right to file a formal application at anytime.\n22a.3\nINFORMAL STAFF MEETING(S)\nInformal staff meeting(s), separate from a Commission Pre-application Review Meeting, can be requested.\nThe nature of the application will determine the extent of a particular town department's involvement. At\nminimum, this will include planning and zoning staff.\nInformal staff meetings may continue at the discretion of town staff.\n22a.4\nPRELIMINARY STAFF REVIEW\nIn addition to informal staff meeting(s) the applicant may request town staff to conduct one (1) preliminary\nreview of the application. Conducting the preliminary review and the content of its submission is at the\ndiscretion of the Commission's agent. This review shall occur prior to a Commission Pre-application\nMeeting, if applicable. Staff will review the submitted information and provide written comments to the\napplicant. Additional comments from staff during the formal application review should be anticipated.\nFor Preliminary Staff Review, submission of detailed plans and reports (i.e. grading and drainage plans,\nerosion and sedimentation control, traffic reports, drainage calculations, etc.) are discouraged.

Such uses, therefore, shall be treated individually\nthrough the use of Special Permits, as provided in Sections 3.17, 3.18, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 6A.5, 7.2, 7A.3, 8.2,\n8A.2, 9.2, 10.3, 11.2, 12.2, 13.2, 14.3, 15.2, 16.2, 17.2, 17A.2 and 19 of these regulations.

The\nCommission makes the following findings which supports the necessity to require these\nregulations:\n1.\nThe Town of Waterford's waterways and wetlands are valuable natural, recreational,\ncultural, aesthetic and economic resources.\n2.\nThe protection and preservation of these resources is in the public interest and is essential\nto the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of Waterford.\n3.\nTown waterways and the near-shore aquatic environment of Long Island Sound have\nbeen identified by the State of Connecticut as impaired water resources, not meeting\ndesignated uses due to water quality.\n4.\nStormwater is recognized as a leading source of non-point pollution to waterways.\n5.\nTo protect and preserve the surface waters and groundwater of Waterford from non-point\nsources of pollution, management of stormwater generated from site construction and\nproperty development is required to minimize increases in stormwater flows, suspended\nsolids, pathogens, toxic contaminants, heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, nutrients\nand floatable debris transported by stormwater to water resources.\nThe Town supports the incorporation of Low Impact Development (LID) strategies and structural\ndesigns into site plans and developments to address stormwater run-off and pollutant loading at its\nsource, to minimize potential adverse impacts to water quality, habitat and ecological integrity,\n"}, {"page": "205", "text": "and to preserve or enhance existing water quality of surface waters and wetlands.
