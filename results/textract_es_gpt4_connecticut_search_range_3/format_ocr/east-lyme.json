It has small and cohesive neighborhoods; a\nvibrant main street; extensive waterfront with marinas, beaches and a public walkway which\npromotes extensive pedestrian access along Niantic Bay. The village center has historically\nfunctioned as the social, civic and commercial center of the community.\nThese characteristics in themselves constitute a sense of place which contributes to the high\nquality of livability of the village. A physically and aesthetically enhanced village also\ntypically results in increased property values. These values ultimately reflect on the degree\nof a place's desirability.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of these Architectural Guidelines is to provide a framework for design that\ndraws inspiration from the traditions of Niantic and similarly situated New England\nSeacoast communities. They promote safe, functional and attractive development of the\nvillage district, enhance the public experience, and grow and protect the commercial\nproperty values by beautifying the communities' appearance. These design standards\nestablish guidelines for new or renovated commercial buildings that will preserve and\naugment the New England Character of the Niantic Village.\nArchitectural Design\nDesign: New buildings and renovations should be designed to fit the specific\ncharacteristics of their particular site. The architecture should be influenced\nby traditional New England building forms and town making patterns, the\nspecific needs of the intended users, the nature of the intended use and other\nsite specific factors. All buildings shall follow fundamental architectural\nprinciples of scale, massing and appropriate detail, and special attention will\nbe paid to the essential elements of building design. These elements include,\nbut are not limited to: foundations; windows, doors and shutters; porches,\nstoops, entries and railings; siding and trim; roofs and dormers; and\nappurtenances such as: chimneys, gutters and downspouts, columns, vents,\nexterior lighting and building identification.\n205\n"}, {"page": "206", "text": "The overall architectural character of any proposed building design should\nbe in harmony with the neighborhood in which such activity is taking place,\nor accomplish as a transition in character between areas of unlike character,\nprotects property values in the neighborhood and preserves and enhances the\nbeauty of the community, its integrity and architecture.\nHuman Scale\nBuildings and site elements should be designed to human scale.

Avoid large flat-\nroofed areas, or conceal them behind parapets or\nsections of sloped roof.\nVertically-aligned windows and entrances.\nWindows\nFenestration (arrangement of windows on the wall)\nshould be architecturally related to the style, materials,\ncolors, and details of the building. Windows and door\nopenings should be proportioned SO that verticals\ndominate horizontals. To the extent possible, upper-\nstory windows shall be vertically aligned with the\nlocation of windows and doors on the ground level,\nincluding storefront or display windows.\nUpper stories should incorporate window patterns\nand designs that are compatible with and\ncomplimentary to existing upper-story\nwindow patterns on the block.\nFirst-floor window and display design should create a\nfeeling of transparency on the ground floor of the\nbuilding. This contributes to a sense of safety and is\nwelcoming to pedestrians. The viewing zone of the first\nfloor fa\u00e7ade should be made up of approximately 75%\ntransparent non-reflective glass. Window displays are\nencouraged, but visibility into the building from the\nsidewalk should be maintained.\nWindow with muntins.\nWindow with shutters.\nWith the exception of retail storefronts, modestly\nscaled, vertically proportioned windows articulated\nwith muntins (dividers of panes of glass) are most\nappropriate to the local building vernacular.

As one of\nthe most important parts of the facade, the main\nentrance should be easily identifiable. Doors and\nGreek revival entrance.\nentryways should follow a traditional storefront\ndesign (usually recessed) and should be\ncompatible with the architectural style of the\nstructure. The entrances should also address the\nprimary street or pedestrian pathway.\nWhen rear parking is provided, the provision of\nVictorian era entrance.\nsecondary rear entrances and pleasing rear\nfacades is strongly encouraged. The design of the\nrear entrances and facades should be\nappropriately detailed to provide an attractive\nappearance, but should not be overly embellished\nto compete with the main storefront.\nWhere a new building is to be located on a\ncorner, each side visible from a street should be\nconsidered a primary storefront fa\u00e7ade and incorporate these fenestration patterns, unless\ndoing SO would unduly obtrude into a primarily\nresidential street.\ner building with attractive entrances and windows\nfacing both major streets.\nMaterials and Colors\nThe town strongly prefers authentic\nnatural materials such as wood, brick,\nand stone for the exterior of structures\nand landscape features.\nConstruct windows, storefronts\nand public doorways of wood\nwhere possible. Synthetic\nmaterials should be as close in\nappearance and detail to the\nnatural material it simulates.\n210\n"}, {"page": "211", "text": "All sides of the building should use materials\nconsistent with those on the front if visible\nfrom public streets or neighboring properties,\nand should be carefully designed with similar\ndetailing, comparable quality, and compatible\nmaterials.\nAwnings\nAwnings that are functional for shade and\nshelter are encouraged. These awnings should\nbe made of canvas or a canvas-like material\nshould fit the shape and scale of the window\nor door they are sheltering, and should be\ndesigned to be compatible with and\ncomplimentary to building signage and\ndesign. Awnings should break at the vertical\ndivisions of the structure (i.e., the break\nbetween the display windows and the\nentrance).\nThe color and pattern of lawnings affect the entire\nbuilding and therefore should be carefully chosen. A\nfacade with minimal architectural detailing can be\nenhanced with bright colors and patterns, while a more\nMain Street Tavern\ndecorated facade may be complemented with a plain,\nsubtle shade. The shape of awnings should be designed to\nfit the building's architecture and relate to other awnings\nSTREET\nthat exist along the street. Traditional retractable awning\nstyles are encouraged.\nOther Elements That Add to New England Heritage:\nShade Trees\nTrees are an important element of landscape design. The inclusion\nof shade trees in site design is encouraged. Shade trees provide an\naesthetic value as well as a functional purpose to Niantic village.\nShade trees are large deciduous trees with spreading canopies, with\nthe most popular being oaks, maples, ashes, elms, and lindens. In\naddition to aesthetic qualities and commercial appeal of these trees,\nthey also have more practical benefits such as reducing heating and\ncooling costs, reducing heat reflected from paved areas, converting\ncarbon dioxide to oxygen, helping prevent soil erosion, increasing property value and\nmuch more. Therefore, preservation and protection of old shade trees as well as planting\nnew ones is strongly encouraged.\n211\n"}, {"page": "212", "text": "Plantings/Landscaping\nThoughtfully designed landscaping appropriate to the context of a small New England\ntown should include the careful use of stone walls, wood fencing, paving materials and\nplantings. These features can tie a structure to its landscape, define spaces and make for a\npleasant pedestrian experience. Preserve mature plantings, stone walls and other historic\nfeatures where possible and minimize modifications to the natural topography of the site.\nLighting\nThe exterior lighting scheme is important to the success of\na storefront design. Lighting that highlights the sign and\ndisplay area is often more effective than general lighting\nof the entire store. When a larger building has a number of\nstorefronts, exterior lighting should be coordinated.\nEnergy efficient lighting is also encouraged. East Lyme\nencourages energy conservation through the use of energy\nefficient bulbs and the elimination of extraneous light that\ncan spill offsite or cause glare. Select pedestrian-\nscaled light fixtures appropriate to building type\nand location. Avoid the use of floodlighting, wall\npacks, and tall light posts intended for lighting\nlarge areas.\nSignage\nIn buildings with multiple storefronts, a coordinated approach to signage throughout the\nbuilding is particularly important. Use signs of similar size, proportion, and materials on\neach store. Varying the color of individual signs can add variety.\nSignage should be appropriately scaled to the building or surface onto which it is placed,\nshould not obscure important architectural features. East Lyme has comprehensive\nsignage regulations (see Section 18 of the Zoning\nRegulations), which provide further detailed\nOLD TOWN\nrequirements.\nIn addition to all other requirements of the Zoning\nRegulations, the applicant for all buildings or structures\nand subject to these guidelines, should submit scaled\nelevation drawings of the proposed structures for a design review. The scale of such\ndrawings should not be smaller than one-eighth inch equals one foot (1/8\"=1'-0\").
