Therefore, the Planning and Zoning\nCommission of Beacon Falls, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:\n53.2 Findings of Fact:\n53.2.1 The flood hazard areas of Beacon Falls, CT are subject to periodic inundation which results in\nloss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental\nservices, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of\nthe tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\n53.2.2 These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses\nvulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-\nproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.\n53.3 Statement of Purpose:\nIt is the purpose of this regulation to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to\nminimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\n53.3.1 Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or\nerosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or\nvelocities;\n53.3.2 Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.\n53.3.3 Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,\nwhich are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n53.3.4 Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood\ndamage, and;\n53.3.5 Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters\nor which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n53.4\nThe objectives of this regulations are:\n53.4.1 To protect human life and health;\n53.4.2 To minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects;\n53.4.3 To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\nMaster Copy: UPDATED: August 15, 2013\n64\nPage Revision:\n"}, {"page": "66", "text": "ARTICLE V: SITE PLANS, EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS\nMaster Copy: UPDATED: August 15, 2013\n65\nPage Revision:\nCELL (1, 1): \n53.4.4 To minimize prolonged business interruptions;\nCELL (1, 2): \n53.4.4 To minimize prolonged business interruptions;\nCELL (2, 1): \n53.4.5 To Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,\nCELL (2, 2): \n53.4.5 To Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains;\nCELL (3, 1): \n53.4.6 To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the prone areas in such a manner as to\nCELL (3, 2): \n53.4.6 To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the prone areas in such a manner as to\nminimize flood blight areas, and;\nCELL (4, 1): \n53.4.7 To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\nCELL (4, 2): \n53.4.7 To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\nCELL (5, 1): \n53.5 Definitions\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (6, 1): \n53.5.1 Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this regulation shall be interpreted\nCELL (6, 2): \n53.5.1 Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this regulation shall be interpreted\nso as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this regulation its\nmost reasonable application.\nCELL (7, 1): \n53.5.2 \"Addition (to an existing building)\" means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter\nCELL (7, 2): \n53.5.2 \"Addition (to an existing building)\" means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter\nof a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a\nfirewall.
