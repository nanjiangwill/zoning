Eligible Exceptions Buildings or parts of buildings used or occupied for residential use shall not b\neligible for a Special Exception from the general parking requirements. For all other uses, all or part o\nthe off-street parking requirements shall be eligible for a Special Exception from the parking requirements\nprovided some portion of the site is within 500 feet of publicly owned off street parking spaces.\n3.3. Parking Reduction Requests If the applicant believes that the required parking amounts are\nin\nexcess of what is needed for the proposed use, the applicant may submit a Special Exception request with\njustification to the Commission for a reduction in parking space requirements. The Commission wil\nconsider and act on this request concurrent with and as part of the full development application process.\n3.4. Parking in the C- 1 Commercial Zone All requirements for number of off-street parking spaces as\nset forth in section 2. Schedule of Off Street Minimum Parking Requirements shall be reduced by 25%\nwhere the use and associated required parking would be located within the C-1 Commercial Zone.\n3.5 Parking for Mixed-Use Developments\nIn Mixed-Use developments, or developments where parking is affected by cooperative agreements\nbetween different land uses, for any proposed use, substantial change in use, construction, conversion, or\nincrease in intensity of use of any buildings or structures, the applicant shall submit a parking demand\nanalysis that demonstrates parking demand patterns. The parking demand analysis prepared by a qualified\ntraffic engineer must be approved by the Commission and will serve as the basis for determination of\nrequired parking at the mixed-use site.\n4. Shared Parking - Special Exception\n4.1. Intent. The Commission encourages off street parking lots for different structures or uses, or for\nmixed uses, to be shared in any zoning district subject to the approval of a Special Exception. At the\napplicant's request, shared parking may be provided as a Special Exception, subject to the following\nprovisions:\nPage 53\n"}, {"page": "56", "text": "4.2. A reciprocal written agreement has been executed by all the parties concerned that assure the\nperpetual joint use of such common parking, a copy of which has been submitted to and is acceptable\nto the Commission. The Commission may forward such agreements to the town legal counsel for\nreview.\n4.3. The Commission may require the applicant to provide a parking study prepared by a qualified\ntraffic engineer with all information deemed necessary to its decision-making on a shared parking\narrangement. This information includes but is not limited to a) the type and hours of operation and\nparking demand, for each use, b) a site plan displaying shared use spaces in the lot and walking\ndistance to the uses sharing the lot, c) a description of the character of land use and parking patterns of\nadjacent land uses, and d) an estimate of anticipated turnover in parking space use over the course of\n12 to 24 hours at the site.\n4.4. Parking spaces to be shared must not be reserved for individuals or groups on a 24-hour basis.\n4.5. Uses sharing a parking facility do not need to be contained on the same lot, but each use shall be a\nmaximum of 500 feet from the closest parking space in the lot providing the shared spaces. A Special\nException to the maximum allowable distance between the use and associated shared parking may be\napproved by the Commission with written justification and supporting information provided by the\napplicant.\n4.6. Uses sharing a parking facility shall provide for safe, convenient walking between uses and\nparking, including safe, well marked pedestrian crossings, signage, and adequate lighting.\n4.7. If the conditions for shared parking become null and void and the shared parking arrangement is\ndiscontinued, this will constitute a violation of zoning regulations for any use approved expressly with shared\nparking. The applicant must then provide written notification of the change to the Zoning Enforcement\nOfficial and, within 60 days of that notice, provide a remedy satisfactory to the Commission to provide\nadequate parking.\n5. Reduction in Parking Space Requirements for Shared Parking\nWhere shared parking is provided among a mix of land uses, the Commission may allow the\nfollowing, at the applicant's request:\n5.1. Up to 30% of the parking spaces required for the predominant use on a site may be shared with\nother uses operating during the same time of day and days of the week. The predominant use is\nconsidered to be that which requires the most parking of those sharing the parking facilities.\n5.2. Up to 75% of the parking spaces required for uses such as theaters, public auditoriums, bowling\nalleys, nightclubs, movie theaters, and similar predominantly evening uses may be shared with uses\nsuch as banks, offices, and similar predominantly daytime uses.\n5.3. Up to 75% of the parking spaces required for uses such as churches and other uses exclusively in\noperation during the weekend may be shared with uses such as medical offices, banks, and other\nsimilar uses predominantly in operation on weekdays.\nPage 54\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "6.
