Quantitative analyses of pre and post development site\ncharacteristics, including any designed mitigating provisions, shall be provided as documentation. The use of\nmitigating provisions shall not affect the quality of water proposed for infiltration. An existing residential building\nlot that was created by an approved subdivision is exempt from this requirement.\n20.13.4 Storm water Management Facilities\nStorm water controls shall be designed to manager site runoff SO that storm water runoff will not cause\ncontamination of the Groundwater. All proposed uses shall include a maintenance plan providing for regular\ninspection, cleaning and long-term maintenance of storm water controls, including basins and pretreatment\nstructures prepared by the Applicant or by the town as determined at the time of review by the Town Manager or\nDesignee.\n190\n"}, {"page": "201", "text": "20.13.5 Public Sanitary Sewers\na.\nSanitary sewers shall be constructed using tight pipe standards.
