The Aquifer Protection District is designated as an overlay zone.\nThe purpose of this section is to facilitate the adequate provision of clean water by prohibiting, within\nthe Aquifer Protection District, land uses which can contaminate ground water resources and by\nregulating other land uses which may have the potential to contaminate or downgrade existing and\npotential ground water supplies.\nThe stratified drift deposits of the Pootatuck Aquifer are composed predominately of inter-bedded\nlayers of sand and gravel with lesser amounts of silt and clay. These deposits are underlain by\ncrystalline bedrock, mostly gneiss and schist. The Pootatuck Aquifer is capable of supplying large\nquantities of drinking water in Newtown and its protection is critical.\nThe Pootatuck Aquifer (a federally protected sole source aquifer) is highly susceptible to\ncontamination because of its relatively high permeability and shallow water table which is recharged\nmainly from precipitation that percolates from the land surfaces within the watershed.\n2.01.200 Applicability\nThese regulations shall be in addition to the requirements for the underlying zoning districts as\ndesignated on the Zoning Map. Both the requirements of the Zoning Regulations as set forth in other\nsections and the requirements contained herein for the Aquifer Protection District shall apply within\nsuch zone.

GENERAL\n1.1 Introduction\nIn 1705 three land speculators from Stratford and New York, acting without authority from the\nColonial Court, purchased a tract of land about eight miles long and six miles wide from the\nIndians. They were prosecuted by the Court for their actions but Samuel Hawley, knowing the\nvalue of the land, convinced investors from Stratford to purchase an interest in the tract. By 1708\nthe General Court of the Colony, upon petition of thirty-six settlers, granted them a Charter to\nform a new township, which was decreed to be called the Town of Newtown. The town\nboundaries were set and by 1709 the Town proper was defined by two crossing highways, Main\nStreet running North-South and The East-West highway now named Church Hill Road. The\nTown prospered and in 1723 a Pohtatuck Indian named Quiomph appeared before the Town\nFathers and announced that he owned a tract of land in Sandy Hook that was not part of the\n1705 sale. The area extended from an \"elbow\" in the Housatonic to Rocky Glen in the area\nwhere the Pohtatuck empties into the Housatonic. The fifty-one Proprietors of Newtown\npurchased the tract from Quiomph and incorporated the Sandy Hook area into the town limits.\nEvidence of this early history is still visible in Sandy Hook center where many homes and mills\nof the colonial period remain. It is this history which these guidelines are intended to protect.\n1.2 The Establishment of the District\nWELCOME\nSANDY\nHOOK\nSandy Hook was designated a Design District under General Statutes of Connecticut (Sec. 8-2)\nwhich provides for the creation of village districts for the purpose of regulating new\nconstruction, substantial reconstruction and rehabilitation of properties.\nThese Design Guidelines set forth the expectations of the Town of Newtown and are intended to\n"}, {"page": "246", "text": "be used as a tool to assist property owners and developers in planning their restoration and new\nconstruction projects.\nMany links to Newtown's history may be found in antique buildings scattered throughout town.\nSandy Hook is the only place in Newtown where it is possible to preserve what is left of a small\ntown commercial center. And here we have the opportunity to encourage development that\nreinforces this unique sense of place for new retail, entertainment, recreational, residential,\nmixed-use and commercial uses.\n1.3 Objectives\na) Preserve and enhance the historic and architectural character of Sandy Hook as well as\nlocally significant features, distinctive buildings or vistas from within the District.\nb) Preserve and enhance the streetscape consistent with the specifications developed by the\nSandy Hook Streetscape Steering Committee (see Appendix B).\nc) Improve vehicular movement.\nd) Promote pedestrian circulation within the District.\n1.4 District Boundaries - See District Map Appendix A\n1.5. Process\n1.5.1 Preliminary Meeting\nApplicants are encouraged to meet with the Design Advisory Board (DAB) before submitting\napplications to the Planning and Zoning Commission. At the preliminary meeting the proposed\nproject will be discussed and the Sandy Hook Design District Guidelines will be reviewed. The\nobjective of the meeting is to give the applicant insight into applicable sections of the guidelines\nand to outline standards for subsequent submission. At the immediate conclusion of the\npreliminary meeting, the DAB shall provide the applicant with its written recommendations\nrelative to the development's design consistent with the provisions of these Guidelines. The\napplicant is encouraged to incorporate such design recommendations, if any, in its formal\nsubmittal to the DAB. The DAB shall also include in its recommendation what demonstrative\nmaterials should be provided by the applicant at the formal submittal stage.\n1.5.2 Formal Submittal\nBased on the preliminary meeting, the applicant will make a formal submittal for DAB review.\nSubmitted materials should be completed to the extent necessary communicate the applicant's\ndesign intent to the DAB. Depending on the scope of the project, suggested submission materials\nmay include:\na) Site plan(s) including landscaping and site improvements.\nb) Floor plan(s) showing the overall arrangement of proposed spaces.\nc) Elevations illustrating the exterior materials and details of the building appearance.\nd) Color renderings of elevations or perspective drawings showing the project in relation to\nits neighbors.\ne) Scale model showing the project's context within the Design District.\nf) Materials Sample Board.\ng) Site photos that include neighboring land and buildings.\n"}, {"page": "247", "text": "The goal of these Guidelines is to encourage development and restoration projects that are\ncompatible with and enhance the character of Sandy Hook, all submissions should clearly show\nthe context into which the proposed project will be constructed.\n1.5.3 DAB Review\na) Within thirty (30) days from the applicant's formal submission, the DAB will review the\napplication and will communicate to the Planning and Zoning Commission a written\nadvisory opinion which shall include and recommendations related to the development's\ndesign consistent with the provisions of these Guidelines.\nb) The DAB is an advisory board only. The Planning and Zoning Commission may\ndisregard, in whole or in part, the recommendations of the DAB for any reason.\n2. SITE\nApplicants are encouraged to include in their developments design characteristics which enhance\nand further the key defining characteristics of Sandy Hook, including but not limited to the\nvaried antique streetscape and views of the Pohtatuck River.\n2.1 Site Planning\nDevelopments adjoining, or within view of the river are encouraged to preserve and enhance\nthese key defining characteristics using the following design techniques:\na) Orient buildings to preserve or maximize views to the river.\nb) Harmonize building footprints, heights, setbacks and massing varied in context with\nsurrounding buildings and structures consistent with the character of the District.\nc)\nWhere voluntary public access is planned aspect of the proposed development, applicants\nare encouraged to:\n1.

To\nmaintain the historic quality of the District it is our objective to promote the development of a\npedestrian friendly environment throughout the District. Such proposed projects will be analyzed\nin terms of the entire District and will be considered within the context of existing and proposed\npedestrian circulation patterns. Nothing in this section, however, shall be interpreted to require\npedestrian access to private property. Where applicable, development designs are encouraged to\ninclude pedestrian walkways which:\na) Provide a pedestrian access linking parking areas behind stores to the street.\nb) Provide appropriate landscaping, paving, and lighting in a manner that will delineate the\n"}, {"page": "249", "text": "walkway as a component of the overall public pedestrian network within the District.\nc)\nAre consistent in terms of design, material finishes and lighting throughout the entire\nDistrict.\nd) Are made of durable materials consistent with the character of the District.
