These regulations permit farm tourism as compatible\naccessory uses. It is recognized that the magnitude of these accessory uses are\noften greater than the uses that surround farms.

Principles.\nAll development in the VCD shall be designed to comply with the following principles:\nA. Properties will be developed in such a way as to reduce the dominance of motor\nvehicles. A new street network within the Village Center will reduce highway\norientation and promote traditional neighborhood-style development.\nB.\nProperties within the VCD will be linked to encourage physical activity and social\ninteraction. A sidewalk system will extend throughout the Village Center District,\nand greenways along natural resource corridors will be created.\nC.\nDevelopment will protect important natural resources, especially surface water and\ngroundwater. All stormwater will be managed in accordance with best management\npractices and the Connecticut DEEP Water Quality Manual to minimize\ncontamination risks.\nD.\nBuildings will be placed at or close to the edge of sidewalks and will provide\npedestrian-scaled facades at street level to encourage walking. A mixture of uses\nwill be provided within and among buildings to further promote pedestrian activity.\nE. Development will be coordinated to the greatest extent feasible to promote a unified\nform. Collaboration on development proposals will be encouraged, and\ninfrastructure and streetscape improvements will be coordinated.\nF.\nArchitecture will emphasize doorways, windows at street level, facade details and\narticulation at a scale that enhances the pedestrian environment.\n\u00a7 340-9.3.

Parking lot landscaping design shall, through the use\nof native trees, shrubs and ground cover and other landscape design\nelements:\n[1] Screen the views of parking areas from the street and adjoining\nproperties.\n[2] Reduce thermal impacts of stormwater runoff through canopy cover\nand site design.\n[3] Filter/retain stormwater runoff through the capture of 75% or more\nof the first flush (first half inch) of stormwater runoff from\nimpervious areas.\n[4] Segment parking areas to no more than 10 spaces utilizing landscape\nelements.\n[5] Accommodate bicyclist and pedestrian movement through the\nparking area.\n(b) These landscaping requirements shall apply to all new parking areas.

All design shall only utilize a variety of native tree and plant\nspecies, no planting material identified as an invasive species by the State of\nConnecticut DEEP shall be utilized. No one species shall compromise more\nthan 50% of the plantings for the particular planting area. Bushes, shrubs and\nground cover plant materials must be in sufficient quantity and size SO that\nwithin five years from planting complete coverage of the area is achieved. Tree\nspecies selection shall take into account that the canopy coverage of the\nimpervious surface shall be 75% within 10 years; therefore, trees selected shall\nprovide shade canopies with a minimum diameter of 10 feet at maturity.\nTemporary mulches are required in all planting areas until full plant coverage\nis achieved. A minimum of one shade tree for each five spaces of provided\nparking shall be required.\n(3)\nPlant protection.

Plant materials showing such\ndamage shall be replaced by the same or similar species. Planting areas shall\nbe kept free from weeds, debris and undesirable materials which may be\ndetrimental to safety, drainage or appearance.\n(4) Perimeter landscaping.\n(a) Perimeter landscaping is required for all parking areas, and the design\nshall maintain for partial screening of vehicles to a minimum height of 30\ninches and maximum height of 42 inches measured from the finish grade\nof the parking space(s) from the public street and abutting properties.\nParking areas adjacent to residential properties shall screen vehicle\nheadlights through the use of an ornamental wall or fence and/or dense\nfoliage located at a minimum of four feet from the curb stop.

Additionally, interior\nlandscaping tree plantings shall provide a shade canopy of at least 10 feet\nat maturity, and there shall be a minimum of two shade trees per\nlandscaped island.

The shading requirement shall apply to all impervious\nsurfacing on which a vehicle can drive, including access drives, parking stalls,\nand all maneuvering areas.
