The Town of Colebrook seeks to maintain the natural environment of\nits watercourses and water bodies, to control pollution caused by\nstormwater runoff, and to control flooding caused by development.\n2. The Town encourages innovative solutions and low impact\ndevelopment techniques.\nB. Principles\nThese Stormwater Management Standards intend to emulate the following goals\nas espoused in the 2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual, as amended:\n1. Preserve pre-development site hydrology (including runoff,\ninfiltration, interception, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge,\nand stream base flow) to the extent possible.\n2. After construction has been completed and the site is permanently\nstabilized, the stormwater treatment practice(s) shall reduce the\naverage annual total suspended solids loadings in the post\ndevelopment runoff by 80 percent. For high quality receiving waters\nand sites with the highest potential for significant pollutant loadings,\nreduce post-development pollutant loadings SO that average annual\npost-development loadings do not exceed pre-development loadings\n(i.e., no net increase).\n3. Preserve and protect wetlands, stream buffers, natural drainage\nsystems, and other natural features that provide water quality and\nquantity benefits.\n40\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "Zoning Regulations\nMarch 15, 2015\nTown of Colebrook\n4. Manage runoff velocity and volume in a manner that maintains or\nimproves the physical and biological character of existing drainage\nsystems and prevents increases in downstream flooding/stream bank\nerosion.\n5. Prevent pollutants from entering receiving waters and wetlands in\namounts that exceed the systems' natural ability to assimilate the\npollutants and provide the desired functions.\n6. Seek multi-objective benefits (i.e., flood control, water quality,\nrecreation, aesthetics, and habitat) from stormwater control measures.\nII. Definitions\nFor this Section 6.12 only, these terms shall be defined as follows:\nAquifer\nA porous water-bearing formation of permeable rock, sand or gravel capable of yielding\neconomically significant quantities of groundwater.\nBest Management Practice (BMP)\nA BMP is a technique, process, activity, or structure used to reduce the pollutant content\nof a storm water discharge. BMPs include simple nonstructural methods, such as good\nhousekeeping and preventive maintenance. BMPs may also include structural\nmodifications, such as the installation of bioretention measures. BMPs are most effective\nwhen used in combination with each other, and customized to meet the specific needs\n(drainage, materials, activities, etc.) of a given operation.\nBioretention\nA practice to manage and treat stormwater runoff by using a specially designed planting\nsoil bed and planting materials to filter runoff stored in a shallow depression. The areas\nconsist of a mix of elements each designed to perform different functions in the removal\nof pollutants and attenuation of stormwater runoff.\nCatch Basin Inserts\nA structure, such as a tray, basket, or bag that typically contains a pollutant removal\nmedium (i.e., filter media) and a method for suspending the structure in the catch basin.\nThey are placed directly inside of existing catch basins where stormwater flows into the\ncatch basin and is treated as it passes through the structure.\nCatch Basin\nA structure placed below grade to conduct water from a street or other paved surface to\nthe storm sewer.\n41\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "Zoning Regulations\nMarch 15, 2015\nTown of Colebrook\nCisterns\nContainers that store larger quantities of rooftop stormwater runoff and may be located\nabove or below ground. Cisterns can also be used on residential, commercial, and\nindustrial sites. See also Rain Barrel.\nDeep Sump Catch Basins\nStorm drain inlets that typically include a grate or curb inlet and a sump to capture trash,\ndebris and some sediment and oil and grease. Also known as an oil and grease catch\nbasin.\nDisturbance\nAny clearing, grubbing, filling, grading, excavating, constructing, depositing, or\nremoving material that could leave the ground surface subject to the potential for\naccelerated erosion or an increase in the rate of runoff.\nDry Detention Pond\nStormwater basin designed to capture, temporarily hold, and gradually release a volume\nof stormwater runoff to attenuate and delay stormwater runoff peaks. Dry detention\nponds provide water quantity control (peak flow control and stream channel protection)\nas opposed to water quality control. Also known as \"dry ponds\" or \"detention basins\".\nFeasible\nAble to be constructed or implemented consistent with sound engineering principles.\nFilter Strip\nA strip or area of vegetation for removing sediment, organic material, nutrients and\nchemicals from runoff or wastewater. They are typically located downgradient of\nstormwater outfalls and level spreaders to reduce flow velocities and promote infiltration\nand filtration.\nGrass Drainage Channels\nTraditional vegetated open channels, typically trapezoidal, triangular, or parabolic in\nshape, whose primary function is to provide non-erosive conveyance, typically up to the\n10-year frequency design flow. They provide limited pollutant removal through filtration\nby grass or other vegetation, sedimentation, biological activity in the grass/soil media, as\nwell as limited infiltration if underlying soils are pervious.\nGroundwater Recharge\nThe process by which water that seeps into the ground, eventually replenishing\ngroundwater aquifers and surface waters such as lakes, streams, and the oceans. This\nprocess helps maintain water flow in streams and wetlands and preserves water table\nlevels that support drinking water supplies.\nGroundwater Recharge Volume (GRV)\nThe post-development design recharge volume (on a storm-event basis) required to\nminimize the loss of annual pre-development groundwater recharge. The GRV is\n42\n"}, {"page": "49", "text": "Zoning Regulations\nMarch 15, 2015\nTown of Colebrook\ndetermined as a function of annual pre-development recharge for site-specific soils or\nsurficial materials, average annual rainfall volume, and amount of impervious cover on a\nsite.\nHydrodynamic Separators\nA group of stormwater treatment technologies designed to remove large particle total\nsuspended solids and large oil droplets, consisting primarily of cylindrical-shaped devices\nthat are designed to fit in or adjacent to existing stormwater drainage systems. The most\ncommon mechanism used in these devices is vortex-enhanced sedimentation, where\nstormwater enters as tangential inlet flow into the side of the cylindrical structure. As the\nstormwater spirals through the chamber, the swirling motion causes the sediments to\nsettle by gravity, removing them from the stormwater.\nImpervious Surfaces\nSurfaces that cannot infiltrate rainfall, including rooftops, pavement, sidewalks, and\ndriveways.\nInfiltration Practices\nStormwater treatment practices designed to capture stormwater runoff and infiltrate it\ninto the ground over a period of days, including infiltration trenches and infiltration\nbasins.\nLow Impact Development (LID)\nLow impact development is a site design strategy intended to maintain or replicate\npredevelopment hydrology through the use of small-scale controls integrated throughout\nthe site to manage runoff as close to its source as possible.\nNonpoint Source Pollution\nPollution caused by diffuse sources that are not regulated as point sources and are\nnormally associated with precipitation and runoff from the land.\nNon-Routine Maintenance\nCorrective measures taken to repair or rehabilitate stormwater controls to proper working\ncondition. Non-routine maintenance is performed as needed, typically in response to\nproblems detected during routine maintenance and inspections.\nOil/Particle Separators\nConsist of a subsurface structure with one or more chambers designed to remove trash\nand debris and to promote sedimentation of coarse materials and separation of free oil (as\nopposed to emulsified or dissolved oil) from stormwater runoff. Oil/particle separators\nare typically designed as off-line systems for pre-treatment of runoff from small\nimpervious areas, and therefore provide minimal attenuation of flow. Also called oil/grit\nseparators, water quality inlets, and oil/water separators.\n43\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "Zoning Regulations\nMarch 15, 2015\nTown of Colebrook\nPermeable Paving Materials\nMaterials that are alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces and that are designed to\nincrease infiltration and reduce stormwater runoff and pollutant loads. Alternative\nmaterials include modular concrete paving blocks, modular concrete or plastic lattice,\ncast-in-place concrete grids, and soil enhancement technologies. Stone, gravel, and other\nlow-tech materials can also be used as alternative for low traffic application such as\ndriveways, haul roads, and access roads.\nPollution\nThe harmful thermal effect or the contamination or rendering unclean or impure of any\nwaters of the state by reason of any waste or other materials discharged or deposited\ntherein by any public or private sewer or otherwise SO as directly or indirectly to come\ninto contact with any waters. This includes, but is not limited to, erosion and\nsedimentation resulting from any filling, land clearing, or excavation activity.\nPorous Pavement\nPorous pavement is similar to conventional asphalt or concrete but is formulated to have\nmore void space for greater water passage through the material.\nPretreatment\nTechniques used in stormwater management to provide storage and removal of coarse\nmaterials, floatables, or other pollutants before the primary treatment practice.\nPrimary Stormwater Treatment Practices\nStormwater treatment practices that are capable of providing high levels of water quality\ntreatment as stand-alone devices: can be grouped into four major categories - stormwater\nponds, stormwater wetlands infiltration practices, filtering practices, and water quality\nswales.\nPrudent\nEconomically and otherwise reasonable in light of the social benefits to be derived from\nthe proposed activity provided cost may be considered in deciding what is prudent and\nfurther provided a mere showing of expense will not necessarily mean an alternative is\nimprudent.\nRain Barrels\nBarrels designed to retain small volumes of runoff for reuse for gardening and\nlandscaping. They are applicable to residential, commercial, and industrial sites and can\nbe incorporated into a site's landscaping plan. The size of the rain barrel is a function of\nrooftop surface area and the design storm to be stored. Rain barrels capture runoff that\nwould otherwise be lost to storm drains, divert water to the landscape, and conserve tap\nwater.
