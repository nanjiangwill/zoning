Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the\nTown of Portland, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:\nB.\nFindings of Fact: The flood hazard areas of the Town of Portland are subject to periodic flood\ninundation which could result in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and\nrelief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and\ngeneral welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses\nvulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or\notherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can\nadversely affect the community.\nC.\nStatement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development,\npromote public health, safety, and general welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to\nflood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or\nerosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or\nvelocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3.\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers\nwhich are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n7-4\nPORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "ARTICLE 7: OVERLAY ZONES\n4.\nControl filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood\ndamage; and\n5.\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD.\nObjectives: The objectives of this regulation are:\nE.\nSeverability: If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of these regulations\nshould be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining\nportions of these regulations, which shall remain in full force and effect; and to this end the\nprovisions of these regulations are hereby declared to be severable.\n7.4.2 Definitions\nUnless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations shall be interpreted SO as to\ngive them the meaning they have in common usage and to give these regulations its most reasonable\napplication.\nA.\n\"Accessory Structure\" means an appurtenant, unfinished structure of less than 401 square feet, the use\nof which shall be incidental or subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of the principal structure\non the parcel, and which shall not be used for human habitation.\nB.\n\"Addition (to an existing building)\" means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a\nbuilding in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall.\nAny walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent\nperimeter load-bearing walls is new construction.\nC.\n\"Appeal\" means either (a) a request for review of the Town Engineer's decision relative to the\nprovisions of these regulations or (b) a request for a variance from the requirements of these\nregulations.\nD.\n\"Area of Shallow Flooding\" - A designated AO, AH, AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a\ncommunity's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of\nflooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where\nthe path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident.
