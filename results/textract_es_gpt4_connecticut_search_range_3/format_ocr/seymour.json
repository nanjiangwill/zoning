It is the intent and purpose of this section to encourage innovation and\nflexibility in the use of the remaining large tracts of land in Seymour by allowing a mixture of residential,\nrecreational and community uses in a single zoning district. It is the finding of the Planning and Zoning\nCommission that such uses can exist in harmony with each other and surrounding residential areas with\nadequate conditions and safeguards. With proper planning, the Planned Development District will result in\na more efficient utilization of land and the preservation of greater areas of open space than what would\nresult from conventional development.\n18.1 Definitions.\na.\nPlanned Residential/Recreational Community. A development consisting of an appropriate mix of\ndetached and attached single-family dwellings, designed and intended for occupancy by persons\n55 years of age or older, together with a major open space area which may be a golf course,\ndesigned and developed as a single, coordinated project. All residential dwellings and their\noccupants shall comply with the requirements of the \"55 or over housing exemption\" as set forth\nby the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.\nb.\nSpecialized Housing for the Elderly.

It shall not be used to allow a parcel to be divided\ninto 25-acre portions by either a present or subsequent owner so that maximum density will\nresult. The Commission shall consider this intent when evaluating a request for a map\nchange to PDD. The permitted density of any parcel subsequently changed to PDD shall\nbe based on the area of the parcel as it exists as of the effective date of this regulation.
