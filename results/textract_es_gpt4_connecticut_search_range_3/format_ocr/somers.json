The numbering of this section differs from other sections of the Regulations since it is intended to\nreplicate the Model Floodplain Management Regulations (October 2018) promulgated by the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP).\n1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSE\n1.1\nSTATUTORY AUTHORIZATION\nThe Legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7-148(c)(7)(A) and in Title\n8, Chapter 124, Section 8-2 of the General Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental\nunits to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its\ncitizenry. Therefore, the Zoning Commission of the Town of Somers, Connecticut, does ordain as\nfollows:\n1.2\nFINDING OF FACT\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Somers are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in\nthe loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental\nservices, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax\nbase, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable\nto floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise\nunprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely\naffect the community.\nThe Town of Somers has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) since\nFebruary 17, 1982. The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and\neach participating community. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and\nresponsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The community's role is of paramount\nimportance. Property owners are able to receive federally- subsidized flood insurance only if the\ncommunity enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the\nNFIP.\n65\n"}, {"page": "70", "text": "Section 5.1\nMay 2019 - Revised Draft\nSPECIAL DISTRICTS\nFLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT\n1.3\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of this [ordinance/regulation] to regulate floodplain development, promote public\nhealth, safety, and general welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in\nspecific areas by provisions designed to:\n66\nCELL (1, 1): \n1.3.1\nCELL (1, 2): \nTo protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;\nCELL (2, 1): \n1.3.2\nCELL (2, 2): \nTo minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;\nCELL (3, 1): \n1.3.3 To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nCELL (3, 2): \n1.3.3 To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\nCELL (4, 1): \n1.3.4\nCELL (4, 2): \nTo minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;\nCELL (5, 1): \n1.3.5\nCELL (5, 2): \nTo minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas mains,\nelectric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the floodplain;\nCELL (6, 1): \n1.3.6 To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nCELL (6, 2): \n1.3.6 To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nhazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas;\nCELL (7, 1): \n1.3.7\nCELL (7, 2): \nTo insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;\nCELL (8, 1): \n1.3.8\nCELL (8, 2): \nTo prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts\nbetween property owners;\nCELL (9, 1): \n1.3.9\nCELL (9, 2): \nTo ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions;\nand\nCELL (10, 1): \n1.3.10 To discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the\nCELL (10, 2): \n1.3.10 To discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the\nactivity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.\nCELL (11, 1): \n1.4\nCELL (11, 2): \nOBJECTIVES\nCELL (12, 1): \nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this [ordinance/regulation] includes objectives, methods and\nprovisions that:\nCELL (12, 2): \nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this [ordinance/regulation] includes objectives, methods and\nprovisions that:\nCELL (13, 1): \n1.4.1\nCELL (13, 2): \nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or\nerosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or\nvelocities;\nCELL (14, 1): \n1.4.2\nCELL (14, 2): \nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n"}, {"page": "71", "text": "May 2019 - Revised Draft\nSection 5.1\nSPECIAL DISTRICTS\nFLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT\n1.4.3\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers\nthat are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n1.4.4 Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood\ndamage; and\n1.4.5\nPrevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert\nflood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n2.0\nDEFINITIONS\nBase Flood - The flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year,\nalso referred to as the one hundred (100) year flood, as published by the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) as part of a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and depicted on a Flood\nInsurance Rate Map (FIRM).\nBase Flood Elevation (BFE) - The elevation of the crest of the base flood or 100-year flood.

SFHAs are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the\nflood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance\nRate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs\npublished in the FIS for a specific location. Also included are areas of potential, demonstrable or\nhistorical flooding, including any area contiguous with but outside the SFHA identified by FEMA, and\nwhere the land surface elevation is lower than the base flood elevation (BFE) as shown in the FIS, and\nthe area is not protected from flooding by a natural or man-made feature.
