Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth\ndoes hereby promulgate the following:\ni.\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation\nwhich results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect\nthe public health, safety and general welfare.\n37\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy\nin flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which\nare inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood\ndamages.\nii.\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and\ngeneral welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\na. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due\nto water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion\nhazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or\nvelocities;\nb.

To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\nd. To minimize business interruptions;\ne.
