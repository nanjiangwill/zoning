It is not the intent of this Section to prohibit or\npreclude development in designated areas. Rather, this Section is intended to establish a pro-\ncess whereby property owner's interests in capitalizing on scenic views or other assets can be\nbalanced with the community's desire to provide a reasonable level of services and to protect\nenvironmentally sensitive steep slopes and hillsides from inappropriate development. The uses\nand standards of this Section are similar to the uses and standards which have been utilized in\nthe Housatonic River Overlay Zone since the 1980s.\nB.\nPhilosophy\n1.
