The Board shall have the following powers and duties:\nA.\nTo hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any\norder, requirement or decision made by the official charged with the\nenforcement of these Regulations.\nB.\nTo hear and decide all matters upon which it is required to pass by specific\nprovisions of these Regulations.\nC.\nTo determine and vary the application of these Regulations in harmony with\ntheir general purpose and intent, and with due consideration for conserving the\npublic health, safety, convenience, welfare and property values solely with\nrespect to a parcel of land where owing to conditions especially affecting such\nparcel but not generally affecting the district in which it is situated, a literal\nenforcement of such Regulations would result in exceptional difficulty or\nunusual hardship so that substantial justice will be done and public safety and\nwelfare secured. In accordance with Public Act 77-509 (Connecticut General\n136\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "Statutes Section 8-6), the Board is hereby prohibited from approving a variance\nwhich has the effect of permitting a use in any zone which is not permitted by\nthese Regulations, as follows:\n1. In addition, in accordance with Connecticut case law, the Board is\nprohibited from varying any condition or requirement set forth in these\nRegulations for a Special Permit or Special Exception use, such uses being\npermitted in the subject zone only when all conditions or requirements\ncontained here are satisfied.\n2. Variances shall only be granted where such an action would be in harmony\nwith the purposes of these Regulations, as set forth in Section 1 of these\nRegulations; and where the literal enforcement of these Regulations would\nresult in unusual hardship, as the same has been defined by the courts of\nthe State of Connecticut, which may be summarized as follows:\na. The hardship recognized by the law is that of the property, due to its\nunique shape, topography, or other inherent condition; the personal\nhardship of the owner, such as age or family condition, is not a legal\nhardship which would support the granting of a variance. The hardship\nmust not be merely financial, such as that the owner would make more\nmoney or lose less money if the variance were granted, as financial\nhardship is personal, and not inherent in the property itself.\nb. The hardship must be unique to the property, in the sense that it is a\ncharacteristic which is not exhibited by other properties in the area or in\nthe zone, and which makes it appropriate for special treatment. Merely\nbeing too small or too narrow is not a legal hardship unless it restricts\nthe property from being put to a reasonable use permitted in the\nsubject zone.\nC. The hardship must not be created by the owner or his/her predecessor\nin title, such as by dividing a parcel to create lots which cannot support\nthe desired use; or creating a topographic condition by excavation, fill,\nor other measures which render the property unusable for its highest\nuse without a variance; or by building a structure which, for whatever\nreason, violates a current zoning regulation.\n3.\nThe burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the requirements for a\nvariance have been met. Variances are to be granted sparingly, and only to the\nminimum extent necessary to allow property to be used for the least intense\nuse which is permitted in the subject zone. Among other objectives, the\nCommission's purpose and intent in the adoption of these Regulations is that\nvariances from the requirements of Section 19-14 Signs, are rarely, if ever, to be\ngranted since that Section provides adequate means for legitimately identifying\nuses of land in the Town of Canterbury.\n137\n"}, {"page": "144", "text": "D.\nTo act on requests concerning the location or construction of, or the relocation,\nconversion, reconstruction, alteration, or enlargement of any of the following:\n1.\nGasoline stations or bulk oil storage facilities, pursuant to Connecticut General\nStatutes Section 14-321.\n2.\nMotor vehicle service or repair shops, pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes\nSection 14-54.\n3.\nNew and used car dealerships including motorcycles and any other\nself-propelled vehicles used for transportation on public streets, pursuant to\nConnecticut General Statutes Section 14-54.\n4.\nMotor vehicle storage facilities, pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes\nSection 14-67.\nE.\nTo act on any other applications as cited in these Regulations or in any other capacity as\ndetermined by the Connecticut General Statutes as amended.\n21.2 Procedures\nA.\nThe Board shall hold a public hearing on all applications and appeals, and shall publish a\nnotice of said hearing as prescribed by these Regulations and the Connecticut General\nStatutes, as amended.\nB.\nIn accordance with Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-6a, whenever an application\nfor a variance is joined with an appeal of any order, requirement or decision of the\nZoning Enforcement Officer, the Board shall decide the issues presented in the appeal\nbefore considering the variance application.\nC.\nThe Board shall hold a public hearing, close such hearing, and render its decision on any\napplication within the time limits imposed by Section 8-7d of the Connecticut General\nStatutes.
