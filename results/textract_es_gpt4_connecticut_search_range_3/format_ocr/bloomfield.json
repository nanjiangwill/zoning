Local, State and Federal governments must share\nroles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The\ncommunity's role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to receive\nFederally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the\nminimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the NFIP.\n5.1.C Purpose.\nIt is the purpose of these Regulations to regulate floodplain development, promote public\nhealth, safety, and general welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood\nconditions in specific areas through provisions designed:\n1.\nTo protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;\n2.\nTo minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;\n3.\nTo minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\ngenerally undertaken at public expense;\n4.\nTo minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;\n5.\nTo minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities;\n6.\nTo help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development\nof flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight\nareas;\n7.\nTo insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;\n8.\nTo prevent increase in flood heights that could exacerbate flood damage and result in\nconflicts between property owners;\n9.\nTo ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for\ntheir actions;\nBloomfield Zoning Regulations - 8.15.2009 (07/06/20) - Page 71\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "10.\nTo discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to\nlocate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain; and,\n11.\nFor Bloomfield to fulfill its role and comply with its obligations as a participant in the\nNFIP.\n5.1.D Objectives.\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, these Regulations include objectives, methods and\nprovisions that:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to\nflood or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood\nheights or velocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial\nimprovement;\n3.\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n4.\nControl filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion\nor flood damage; and\n5.\nPrevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n5.1.E Application of These Regulations.\nThese regulations shall apply to all development in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA)\nwithin Bloomfield.
