Accordingly, it is the purpose of these Regulations to\ninsure that: Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes\nwithout danger to health or the public safety; proper provision shall be made for water supply, surface\ndrainage and sanitary sewage, and, in areas contiguous to brooks, rivers or other bodies of water\nsubject to flooding, proper provision shall be made for protective flood control measures; proposed\nroads shall be in harmony with existing or proposed principal thoroughfares shown in the Plan\nof\nDevelopment as the same may be amended from time to time, especially with regard to safe\nintersections with such thoroughfares, and proposed roads shall be so arranged and of such width\nas to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs, and\nroads and driveways shall provide adequate access to properties for fire-fighting apparatus and other\nemergency services; when and in places deemed proper by the Commission open spaces for parks\nand playgrounds shall be shown on the subdivision plan; proper provision shall be made for soil\nerosion and sediment control pursuant to Section 22a-329 of the General Statutes of the State of\nConnecticut; provisions shall be made for energy-efficient patterns of development and land use, the\nuse of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy conservation.\nSECTION I.A.2.\nThese Regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance,\nregulation, or other provision of law, or any easement, covenant, or other private agreement or legal\nrelationship.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PRINCIPALS OF LAND SUBDIVISION\nSECTION I.B.1. GENERAL\nThe following principles and standards are consistent with good subdivision design when applied to\nthe rural, low density of population character of the Town. It is not the intent of the Commission to\nestablish a rigid form of design, but rather to give developers freedom to lay out their property into a\nsafe, sanitary, and desirable residential development, while achieving the maximum benefit to\nthemselves, to the ultimate residents and to the Town itself. The subdivision plan must conform to\nthe following requirements:\na)\nThe Subdivision Map.\n1)\nShall conform to all requirements for filing with the Town Clerk as part of the Land\nRecords of the Town.\nb)\nThe Property.\n1)\nOn land contiguous to brooks, rivers or other bodies of water subject to flooding,\nproper provision shall be made by the developer for protective flood control\nmeasures in connection with the applicable provisions of Town Ordinances. Land\nsubject to flooding and land otherwise deemed by the Commission to be unsuitable\nfor residential use because of hazard to health, safety or property, shall not be\nsubdivided for residential occupancy nor for any use which might increase the\nhazard.\n2)\nWhen the proposed subdivision covers only a part of an existing tract or only a part\nof the subdivider's holding, a sketch of the prospective future street system of the\nremainder of the holding or tract shall be submitted. In reviewing the proposed\nsubdivision, the Commission shall consider both the proposed subdivision and the\nremainder tract and their relationship.\nc)\nThe Designated Uses. These Regulations recognize that the Town of Eastford has no\nzoning regulations, and that the Commission cannot designate or regulate the proposed use\nfor any lot. No subdivision shall be denied by the Commission due to the use, or combination\nof uses, designated by the subdivider in accordance with these Regulations. Likewise, these\nRegulations contain no buffering requirements between designated uses, nor any other\nprovisions which regulate the improvement of an individual lot based upon its use\ndesignation (except for driveway specifications and other provisions to insure safe access\nand minimize off-site adverse impacts).\nAt the same time, the Commission requests the subdivider to be mindful of the reasons why\nzoning regulations exist in most American communities: Certain uses are inherently\nincompatible, or may be incompatible without adequate lot sizes, buffering, and other special\nmeasures. The value of the subdivider's property, and the lots within any subdivision, are\nprotected and enhanced by the grouping of compatible uses, and physical separation of\nS-2\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "incompatible uses. Lot purchasers will have a greater incentive to invest in the subdivision\nif they perceive that it has been designed so as to harmonize existing and proposed uses,\nand to preserve that harmony for the long term. Likewise, although these Regulations\ncontain very conservative minimum lot sizes and setbacks to insure that the lots are capable\nof being developed without impairing the public health, safety and welfare, lots which are of\ngenerous size and proper shape for parking and which provide room for expansion and\nprivacy will be of greater value to the purchaser, and hence of greater profit to the subdivider.\nThe Commission is prepared to work with subdividers who desire advice or suggestions\nabout how land uses can be designated, and subdivisions designed in ways which provide\nthe greatest protection and enhancement of property values.\nS-3\n"}, {"page": "10", "text": "CHAPTER Il - DEFINITIONS\nFor the purpose of these Regulations, certain terms and words used herein shall be used, interpreted and\ndefined as set forth in this Chapter:\nS-4\nCELL (1, 1): \nII.1.\nCELL (1, 2): \nAccessory Building or Structure: A building or structure, in addition to the principal building, which\nis clearly subordinate to, and customarily incidental to, and located upon the same lot as, the principal\nbuilding or on a contiguous lot under the same ownership.

INTERIOR LOTS\nSECTION X.B. PURPOSE\nAlthough a general pattern of Frontage Lots is essential for the development of an adequate pattern of streets\nand highways, and for the provision of emergency and general public services to the occupants or users of\nlots, the Commission recognizes that occasional situations may arise where development as a Frontage Lot\nis infeasible or impractical due to topographic or other conditions. The Commission also recognizes that\ncertain persons desire the greater privacy afforded by Interior Lots and are willing to accept the greater\nmaintenance costs and risks inherent in such development. Therefore, Interior Lots shall be permitted in\naccordance with the provisions of these Regulations.\nSECTION X.B.2. REQUIREMENTS\nIn accordance with the adopted Plan of Development, and in recognition of the fact that it will be difficult for\noccasional parcels of land to comply with the preceding minimum lot frontage requirements, some flexibility\nshall be provided by permitting Interior Lots while restricting them so that they do not frustrate the purpose of\nrequiring minimum lot area and frontage. Accordingly, the Commission may approve Interior Lots in\naccordance with this Section X.B. Approved Interior Lots shall meet the following requirements:\n1)\nMinimum Lot Area, Gross and Minimum Building Lot Area Rectangle: The requirements shall\napply as those contained in Sections VI.2.(f).1. and VI.2.(f).2., but the calculation thereof shall\nexclude the accessway.\n2)\nMinimum Lot Frontage: Twenty-five (25') feet.\n3)\nMinimum Lot Setbacks: Seventy-five (75') feet front and rear setbacks, excluding the area of\nthe accessway.\n4)\nFuture Development Patterns: The Commission shall not approve a new Interior Lot or Lots\nuntil it determines that such lot or lots provides the best development of the land, considering\nsubject lot and adjacent lot configurations, topography and other natural resource\ncharacteristics, drainage and traffic impacts, accessibility by occupants and emergency\nvehicles during all weather conditions and seasons, driveway sightlines and utility service\ncapabilities.

Said\naccessway must be capable of supporting a driveway which satisfies the provisions of Section\nVI.4. and which driveway is located entirely on the lot from the point at which the accessway\ntouches the street up to the location of the dwelling on the lot, and such driveway must be\ndepicted on the Subdivision Plan, but need not actually be constructed as depicted if the lot\nutilizes a common driveway in accordance with paragraph 9 below. The side of the lot from\nwhich the accessway leads shall be considered as the front lot line of any proposed Interior\nLot.\n8)\nMaintenance: The owner of an Interior Lot shall provide and maintain, as per approval\nspecifications, the driveway, drainage and utilities within the accessway and shall be\nresponsible for a continued maintenance and liability.\n9)\nContiguous Interior Lots: There shall be a maximum of two (2) adjacent or contiguous Interior\nLots, including Interior Lots on abutting properties. Contiguous lots may share a common\ndriveway which satisfies the provisions of Section VI.4. provided that no more than three (3)\ndwelling units are served, only two (2) of which are situated on Interior Lots.\n10) No Landlocking: No Interior Lot or lots shall landlock rear land or restrict the potential for\nfeasible future access, unless the Commission finds that there is no feasible alternative, either\nexisting or future, to development as an Interior Lot.\n11) Maximum Number of Interior Lots: There shall be no more than one (1) Interior Lot in a\nsubdivision of five (5) lots or less. Subdivisions of more than five (5) lots may have no more\nthan one (1) Interior Lot for every four (4) Frontage Lots. For the purposes of this subsection\nonly, in calculating the number of allowable Interior Lots, the applicant may include any number\nof Frontage Lots legally divided or subdivided out of the subject parcel as it was constituted as\nof February 13, 1967 (the date upon which Subdivision Regulations were first adopted in\nEastford).\nS-81\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "CHAPTER XI - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\nSECTION XI.1 TREES, SOIL REMOVAL AND ROADS\nSECTION XI.2.
