WAIVERS AND EXCEPTIONS\nIt is the intent of these regulations that all structures and land uses be provided with a sufficient\namount of off-street motor vehicle parking, while allowing for some flexibility of site design to\naccommodate the unique characteristics of individual properties or aggregation of properties.\nThis section of the regulations is intended to set standards for conditions under which a waiver\nor exception from the general parking requirements may be allowed.\nThe Commission may require the submission of a parking demand analysis as part of any\nrequest for a waiver or exception from the general parking requirements. Except for buildings\nor parts of buildings used or occupied for residential use, all or part of the off-street parking\nrequirements may be waived by the Commission where the proposed site creates unique\nparking demand, design or construction.\n1. Parking Reduction Requests.\nIn the case that an applicant believes that the required parking amounts are in excess of\nwhat is needed for the proposed use, the applicant may submit a request with\njustification to the Commission for a reduction in parking space requirements based on a\nparking demand analysis. The Commission will consider and act on this request\nconcurrent with, and as a part of, the full development application process.\n2.

Shared Parking.\nBy Special Permit, the Commission may allow up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the\nrequired parking spaces for a use which operates primarily during the evening or on\nweekends to be counted toward the parking requirements of a use which operates\nprimarily during the daytime or on weekdays, and vice versa. All of the shared parking\nspaces shall be located within five hundred (500) feet more or less of the main building\nentrance of the recipient use. In approving such a Special Permit, the Commission shall\nfind that there shall not be a substantial overlap of peak parking periods for the uses and\nthat legally documented arrangements satisfactory to the Commission have been made\nto guarantee long-term access to and use of the shared parking spaces by the recipient\nuse.\n4. Common Parking.\nBy Special Permit, the Commission may allow common parking for multiple lots and\nmultiple uses, especially in connection with a unified village plan, provided that the\napplicant provides evidence of reciprocal parking and access and utility rights affecting\nall uses within the unified plan, and provided that the parking meets the requirements\nof this section.\n5. Reserved Parking.\nIf an applicant can demonstrate that the demand for off-street parking spaces for the proposed\nuse is less than the minimum required, the Commission may agree to the applicant reserving up\nto twenty-five percent (25%) of the required spaces for future parking needs. Such reserved\nspaces shall be of standard size, shown in dotted lines on the site plan and labeled \"Reserved\nParking,\" and shall be limited to natural or grassed areas without trees or buildings thereon.\nThe Commission may require the future construction of said reserved parking, or a portion\nthereof, into paved parking within three (3) months of written notice to do SO based upon a\nchange in parking demand, a change of use or a change in traffic safety circumstances as\ndetermined by the Commission.

When parking is located in the front yard it shall be separated from the street by\nplantings, earth berms, walls and/or other landscape elements to minimize the view of\nvehicles from streets, roads and drives, while still allowing the public to see the building.\n10. Landscape material surrounding parking lots and in islands shall be able to tolerate\nlarge quantities of snow stored during winter months. The landscape plan shall\nintegrate with the site plan that indicates the area for snow storage.\n11. The branching habit of trees shall be considered in selecting plant material near\npedestrian or vehicular areas; all branches below 7' shall be pruned at the time of\ninstallation.\nBolton, Connecticut Architectural and Site Design Guidelines 8-99\n"}, {"page": "308", "text": "12. Trees that may damage automobiles (dripping sap, messy fruit, or hard seeds such as\nacorns) are discouraged in or around parking lots.\n13. The landscaping shall integrate with the overall design of the site. Generally trees and\nother plantings in a linear pattern enhance a drive and reinforce the grid inherent in a\nparking lot.\n8.3\nCoordination with Architecture and Circulation\nLandscaping can be used to enhance features of the building and direct a visitor's eye to the\nentry.\nDesign Guidelines\n1. Landscaping shall be carefully selected and located to complement the building\nelevations without blocking entryways, signs or lighting.\n2. Trees shall be predominately large shade trees and planted a minimum of 5' from the\nroad right-of-way. Trees and other landscaping planted at intersections and driveway\nentries shall preserve an adequate sight triangle as determined by a traffic engineer.\n3.\nTrees whose future branching may interfere with pedestrian movement shall be avoided.\nTrees selected for areas with outdoor seating shall avoid messy fruit or excessive leaf\nlitter.\n4. Prune dead or dying branches at installation.\n5. Branching of shade trees shall be trimmed at time of planting and maintained to a minimum\nof 7 feet clear for safe pedestrian circulation.\n6. Planted beds are recommended along building edges, foundations and uninterrupted\nwalls. Plantings shall provide either a formal pattern or a naturalistic blend of heights,\nBolton, Connecticut Architectural and Site Design Guidelines I 8-100\n"}, {"page": "309", "text": "colors and textures. Plants shall be generally planted in large masses or 'drifts' rather\nthan individual specimens, to provide a pleasing effect for both the motorist and\npedestrian.\n8.4\nLandscape Maintenance\nLandscaping plans shall anticipate a 3-8 year growing cycle to achieve maturity for shrubs,\nand a 15-20 year growing period for trees to achieve maturity. Proper maintenance shall\nbe assured so the site continues to improve as the landscaping achieves maturity.\nDesign Guidelines\n1. A written maintenance plan shall be provided for all landscape elements. The\nmaintenance plan shall include details on initial installation, guarantee period, replacement\npolicy, periodic and seasonal maintenance, special considerations, use of pesticides\nand fertilizers, irrigation and seasonal displays.\n2. All plant material shall be allowed to achieve their natural forms without excessive pruning.\n3. Shaping evergreen shrubs into tight geometrical forms are strongly discouraged.\n4.\nThe use of plant material and landscape elements that require a low degree of\nmaintenance is strongly encouraged.\n5. Planting characteristics to be considered include: draught resistance, salt tolerance,\ntolerant of urban conditions, and disease and insect resistant\n6. Where plant materials specified on the planting plan do not survive or are damaged, they\nshall be replaced.\nBolton, Connecticut Architectural and Site Design Guidelines 8-101\n"}, {"page": "310", "text": "Town of Bolton\nRoute 44\nIncentive Housing Zone Study\nBOLTON ARCHITECTURAL\nAND SITE DESIGN GUIDELINES:\nCONCEPT PLAN ACCOMPANIMENT\nMay 15, 2012\ngoderre\n& associates\nlandscape architects\n860.468.4355\nodereassociates.com\nurban designers\nplanners\nwith:\nBranse, Willis and Knapp. LLC\n"}, {"page": "311", "text": "goderne\nlandscape architects\nurban designer\nOPEN SPACE\nplanners\nSINGLE FAMILY HOMES (TYP)\ne\nif\nTOWNHOMES (TYP.)\nC\n0\nMULTIFAMILY\nPROVIDE BUS STOPS\nWITH SHELTER\nCONNDOT\nMIXED USE\nGARAGE\nINCORPORATE BIKE LANES\nCOMMUTER\nWITHIN MAIN ROADS\nPARKING\nROUTE 44 STREETSCAPE\nEXTEND\nSTREETSCAPE\nROUTE\n44\nEXTEND BIKE LANE\nROUTE\nEXTEND\nSTREETSCAPE\nGATEWAY/FOCAL POINT\nSIMONIZ\n1-384w8\nRevisions\n1-384 ES\nAQUIFER\nPROTECTION\nEXISTING GREENWAY\nAREA\nDate 5/15/12\nDrawn By:DBC\nProj.
