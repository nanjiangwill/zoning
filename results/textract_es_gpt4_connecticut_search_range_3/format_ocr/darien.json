NOROTON BAY DISTRICT RESIDENTIAL ZONE (R-NBD)\n411.\nBackground and Purposes\nThe Noroton Bay District Residential Zone (R-NBD) is a collection of approximately 77\nlots, many of which were created in accordance with a 1926 Map that was filed in the\nDarien Land Records as Map #341. All of these properties are in the private association\nknown as The Noroton Bay Homeowners Association. There are other properties that are\nwithin the immediate area of this district, which have a lot size of one acre or more, and\ntherefore, are not included in this District. Streets and storm drainage systems in the\nneighborhood are privately owned and maintained. About twenty eight of the seventy\nseven lots were originally created with a size of approximately eight-thousand to eight-\nthousand four hundred square feet, or a little more than one-sixth of an acre. Houses are\nnow constructed on a variety of lot sizes, including \"single\" lots consisting of about 8,000\nto 8,400 square feet; \"double\" lots consisting of about 16,000 to 16,800 square feet; and\nother varying sizes ranging up to the one plus acres owned by the Noroton Yacht Club.\nFrom the time that zoning was first established in Darien in 1925 until 1946, the portion\nof Noroton Bay generally outlined in this R-NBD zone was in the \"B\" Residence Zone,\nallowing nine families per acre. This area was treated separately and distinctly from the\nadjacent \"A\" or \"AA\" Residence Zones, which extended from Nearwater Lane/Brush\nIsland Road northward, and southward to Pratt Island and Nash Island. In 1946, this\ndistinct area of the Bay was rezoned to \"AAA\", allowing one family per acre, i.e., one-\nacre minimum lot size, thereby rezoning it to be the same as the adjacent areas to the\nnorth and south. In 1957, the \"AAA\" zone was changed to \"R-1\", which has been in\neffect until this rezoning.\nDuring the ensuing years from 1957, many variance applications were received for\nproposed construction of additions to existing residences or replacement residences\nbecause virtually none of the lots in this neighborhood complied with the one-acre\nminimum lot size, lot width, or lot depth requirements of the R-1 Zone. None of the\nstructures complied fully with all of the building setback and yard requirements.\nEnactment of Flood Damage Prevention Regulations has required many structures to be\nelevated as substantial renovations or new construction was proposed. The Flood\nDamage Prevention Regulations require that the lowest floor (including basement) be at\nleast one foot above the expected flood level. The flood level is generally one to three\nfeet above the existing ground level.\nIn late October 2012, a storm affected many houses in Noroton Bay, resulting in flood\ndamage to many of the residential structures and the Noroton Yacht Club. In December\n2012, FEMA noted that new Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) would take effect in\nmid-2013. This would result in most of Noroton Bay, which is now in the AE elevation\n10 or AE elevation 11 zones to become AE elevation 14, thus requiring additional\nelevation of any first floor finished space. This modified FEMA mapping affects almost\nevery house within this zoning district (some of the waterfront properties are currently in\nthe VE-14 flood zone and will not be impacted by the proposed new FIRM). Basements\nare not permitted within the flood hazard zones. The Commission wants to encourage\nproperty owners to comply with all of the flood damage prevention requirements.\nBecause of the unique nature of this zone, with relatively small lots and all structures\nwithin a flood zone, which flood zone elevation is generally four feet or more higher than\nPage IV-9\n"}, {"page": "79", "text": "the adjacent streets, special provisions are included, exempting the first six inches of leave\nand up to twenty square feet of stair landing/stoop overhangs from Building Coverage,\nmaking it easier for property owners to elevate their house to meet applicable FEMA\nstandards.\nIn the Noroton Bay District zone: the properties and circumstances of this neighborhood\nare extremely different from the other properties in the R-1 Zone both to the north and\nsouth of this District; the neighborhood has a unique character; lot sizes within this area\nof Noroton Bay vary dramatically, oftentimes with small lots adjacent to much larger\nlots; and all of the properties are within the flood hazard zone. The purposes of the R-\nNBD Zone are: to create more practical and logical regulations that will allow for the\nreasonable use of properties without the need for variances; and where possible,\nre-\nadaptation of the houses in the neighborhood, while still protecting this neighborhood's\ncharacter and the other purposes outlined in Section 100 of the Darien Zoning\nRegulations.\n[Amended 4/14/2013]\nPage IV-10\nCELL (1, 1): \n412.\nCELL (1, 2): \nPermitted Principal Uses\nPermitted principal uses in this zone shall be the same as allowed in all other R-2, R-1, R-\n1/2, R-1/3 and R-1/5 Zones, as noted in Section 402 of these Regulations.\nCELL (2, 1): \n413.\nCELL (2, 2): \nPermitted Accessory Uses\nPermitted accessory uses in this zone shall be the same as allowed in all other R-2, R-1,\nR-1/2, R-1/3 and R-1/5 Zones, as noted in Section 403 of these Regulations.\nCELL (3, 1): \n414.\nCELL (3, 2): \nPrincipal Uses Requiring Special Permits\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nPrincipal uses requiring a Special Permit in accordance with Section 1000 shall be the\nsame as allowed in all other R-2, R-1, R-1/2, R-1/3 and R-1/5 Zones, as noted in Section\n404 of these Regulations.\nCELL (5, 1): \n415.\nCELL (5, 2): \nAccessory Uses Requiring Special Permits\nAccessory uses requiring a Special Permit in accordance with Section 1000 shall be the\nsame as allowed in all other R-2, R-1, R-1/2, R-1/3 and R-1/5 Zones, as noted in Section\n405 of these Regulations.\nCELL (6, 1): \n416.\nCELL (6, 2): \nArea and Bulk Requirements\nThe requirements listed for the Noroton Bay District Residential Zone (R-NBD) shall be\ndeemed to be the minimum or maximum requirements in every instance of their application.\nDimensions are in feet unless otherwise indicated.\n[Amended 4/14/2013]\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "Notes:\na.\nSee Sections 334 and 339 for application of \"minimum width\".\nb.\nSee Section 333.\nC.\nSee Section 385 where lots are of non-conforming dimensions.\nd.\nDetached accessory structures within five feet of a principal structure or with\nany portion of the structure over eight (8) feet in height shall observe the\nsame setbacks as for main buildings.\ne.\nSee Section 335.\nf.\nSee Section 332.\ng.\nSpecial Provision for Utility Sheds.\nNo more than one utility shed shall be permitted on each property provided:\n1.

These uses frequently are a one of a kind\nuse in the Town - such as the Town Hall, the Public Works garage, the firefighting\ntraining facility, the middle school, the high school, the Darien Library, the Senior\nCenter, the Darien Police station, the EMS headquarters and garage, while others have\nmore than one facility in the Town, but are dispersed in different areas of the community\n- such as the three Fire Stations, the public elementary schools, public housing, as well as\nbuildings and facilities in the public parks and beaches. In a municipality that is more\nthan ninety-percent developed, it is nearly impossible to find undeveloped parcels for\nmunicipal uses or uses serving a public purpose. The application of current regulations\nfrequently limits or precludes the expansion of existing uses to meet future growth\nrequirements. For example, in the residential zones, a 30 foot maximum building height\napplies to most municipal and public use buildings including the Darien Town Hall, the\nDarien Police Department, the Noroton and Noroton Heights the volunteer fire\ndepartments, the volunteer EMS service and all public schools. Those uses located in the\ncommercial zones are subject to even more restrictive building height limitations of 25\nfeet or 28 feet. These requirements restrict necessary growth, encourage footprint sprawl,\nincrease building costs and decrease available open space. The intent of this Municipal\nUse Overlay Zone is to permit flexibility in building height, parking and buffer\nrequirements primarily to permit vertical expansion in lieu of expansion of building and\nstructural footprints. Such flexibility shall be granted only where the Commission\ndetermines the appropriateness of a particular location for the zone, and only after Special\nPermit approval of the specific use and facility. Not all municipal existing or proposed\nuses or properties will be appropriate for the Municipal Use Overlay Zone, but the\ncreation and placement of the MU zone provides for greater flexibility for the Town to\nprovide essential services to the community while still protecting the high quality of\ndevelopment and character of the town and protecting the properties in proximity to\nmunicipal facilities.\n422.\nPrincipal Uses Requiring Special Permit\nThe following uses may be permitted subject to approval of a Special Permit in\naccordance with Section 1000, and then a Zoning Permit in accordance with Subsection\n1102 and the standards set forth below:\na.\nMunicipal buildings, structures and uses (including facilities of the Darien Board of\nEducation).\nb.\nBuildings, structures and uses that serve a public purpose, not including uses carried\non primarily for profit, that would normally be constructed by and or operated by the\nmunicipality, but which are under the auspices of a quasi-municipal entity such as\nthe Darien Library Inc., or Post 53 EMS service, or one of the three privately\noperated volunteer fire departments.\nPage IV-13\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "423.\nPermitted Accessory Uses Requiring Special Permit\nThe following uses may be permitted subject to approval of a Special Permit in\naccordance with Section 1000, and then a Zoning Permit in accordance with Subsection\n1102 and the standards set forth below:\na.\nSigns in accordance with Section 920.\nb.\nAny building or use customarily incidental to a permitted use and specifically\napproved by the Commission.\nC.\nReasonable and appropriate off-street parking and loading facilities in accordance\nwith Section 900 as those requirements may be adjusted by the Commission in each\ninstance based upon a review of the specific location, design and circumstances of\nthe existing and/or proposed use.\nd.\nAccessory food services, consisting of the sale of prepared food for consumption on\nthe premises by visitors and employees.\n424.\nArea and Bulk Requirements\nThe following requirements shall be deemed to be the minimum or maximum\nrequirements in every instance of their application.

ACTIVE SENIOR RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY ZONE\n[Added 10/26/2014]\n431.\nBackground and Purposes\nHousing for active senior \"empty nesters\" is an important element of residential\ndevelopment within the Town. Such housing enables older residents to continue to reside\nin Town by living in specially designed single-family residences. The Active Senior\nResidential Overlay Zone allows the development of such dwellings, by permitting\nincreased density on larger parcels in the R-1 Zone, while preserving the single-family\nresidential character of the surrounding area. Increased density on larger lots, combined\nwith strict limitations on building coverage and height, provides opportunities for active\nsenior housing.

The district is a transitional zone\nbetween the Central Business District and the lower density residential districts on the\nperiphery of that center and provides for the construction of residential dwellings as an\nalternative form of development to that which is still permitted in the DB Zone. The\npublic interest is to provide a desirable alternative to presently permitted commercial uses\nwithin the DB portions of this zone, to provide a broader choice of housing types in\nDarien, and to preserve the residential character of Darien. This zone permits the\nestablishment of multi-family housing units that will serve the housing needs of persons\nwho desire this form of housing with its associated conveniences and advantages, and\nwill also meet certain social needs and requirements within the community. In particular,\nthe DBR district is intended to provide a diverse range of housing alternatives with senior\nand moderate income housing being specifically encouraged.\n502.\nSite Required to be Served by Public Water and Public Sewerage Facilities\nTo qualify for development under these DBR regulations, a site shall be served by public\nwater and public sewerage facilities of sufficient capacity for the proposed development.\n503.\nPrincipal Uses Requiring Special Permits\nThe following uses shall be permitted subject to approval of a Special Permit in\naccordance with Section 1000 and the standards set forth below:\na.\nMulti-family dwellings.\nb.\nRelated accessory buildings, structures and uses.\n504.\nArea and Bulk Requirements\nThe following requirements shall be deemed to be the minimum or maximum\nrequirements in every instance of their application.

Affordable housing which fully satisfies the intent,\nrequirements and purposes of Section 8-30g of the Connecticut General Statutes must be\npart of any housing proposal submitted for approval within this Zone. If the property is\nnot developed for affordable housing in accordance with the requirements of the stated\nstatutes, the district shall continue to be subject to all requirements of the Designed\nMulti-family Residential Zone as set forth in Section 520 of the Regulations. The district\nrequirements recognize the location of the property which is separated from single-family\nresidential neighborhoods by the railroad tracks to the north, the John Davis Lodge\nTurnpike (Interstate 95) to the south, Hollow Tree Ridge Road and the commuter parking\nlot to the least, and to the west, a large undeveloped tract of land which is in the DMR\nZone. The isolated location of the site limits density of development to preserve the\nhealth and safety aspects of the community. The district is close to the Noroton Heights\nShopping Center, the Stop and Shop shopping center, the Noroton Heights Train Station\nand not far from the Middlesex Middle School. Development in accordance with these\nRegulations will provide a broader choice of housing types to address the needs for\naffordable housing while still preserving the predominant single family residential\ncharacter of Darien. Such multi-family affordable housing under Section 8-30g of the\nConnecticut General Statutes may only be constructed here, where it will be in close\nproximity to commercial services and mass transportation facilities, and will not be\nadjacent to or adversely impact existing or potential single-family residences.

Background and Purposes - Self Storage\nThis Self-Storage use is created in response to an application to amend the Zoning\nRegulations to permit the development of a self-storage facility on the 3.7 acre tract on\nthe west side of Hollow Tree Ridge Road. If the property is not developed for affordable\nhousing per the above or self-storage, the district shall continue to be subject to all\nrequirements of the Designed Multi-Family Residential Zone as set forth in Section 520\nof the Regulations. The district requirements recognize the location of the property which\nis separated from single-family residential neighborhoods by the railroad tracks to the\nnorth. the John Davis Lodge Turnpike (Interstate 95) to the south, Hollow Tree Ridge\nRoad and the commuter parking lot to the east, and to the west a large multi-family\nresidential development (Avalon). The lack of access to public sewage facilities limits\ndevelopment options for the 3.7 acre tract. The district is close to the Noroton Heights\nShopping Center, the Stop and Shop shopping center, the Noroton Heights train station,\nthe Avalon residences and not far from Middlesex Middle School. Development in\naccordance with these regulations will provide storage options to residential homeowners\nPage V-22\n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "in Darien.

These Regulations are designed to encourage\nthe\norderly development of this district in a manner which encourages the preservation of the\nexisting architectural character of this zone and, at the same time, to provide the\nopportunity for creative and flexible architectural design. The sound inter-relationship of\nbuildings to plazas and open spaces, provisions for proper pedestrian and vehicular\ncirculation and consolidated central parking areas, and encouragement of a mix of housing\nand business uses which are necessary and desirable to serve the needs of the residential\ncommunity are also specifically addressed in these Regulations. These Regulations are\ndesigned for Commercial Sales and Service uses (except for Financial Service uses) on\nthe first floor areas and to provide sufficient spaces for Business and Professional Offices\nand encourage Dwelling Units in upper floor spaces. The intent is to strengthen the\nviability of housing and retail business in the Central Business District and to foster\npedestrian activity as fully as is practical.\nThe area within the Central Business District and adjacent to the Interstate 95\n(Connecticut Turnpike) right-of-way presents a unique opportunity for redevelopment on\na larger scale, and in a manner that utilizes the proximity of the Interstate 95 (Connecticut\nTurnpike) right-of-way and entrances and exits at the Boston Post Road. The width of\nthat right-of-way serves as a buffer to minimize the impact of larger structures from the\nresidential zone to the south of the right-of-way. The Corbin Subarea also presents an\nopportunity to distribute traffic through the use of on-site streets and on-site parking.\nAccordingly, the Corbin Subarea regulations encourage comprehensive, mixed-use\ndevelopments, with public greens and plazas, landscaped pedestrian plazas, public\namenities, internal streets and off-street parking facilities sufficient to meet the parking\nrequirements of a larger redevelopment.

Single-Family Open Space Development\n[Amended 4/12/2009]\n1052.1 Background and Purposes\nOpen space plays an important role in Town for environmental/ conservation\npurposes, aesthetic purposes and for passive enjoyment and may include\nwoodlands, wetlands, vacant property left in its natural state and naturally\nlandscaped open areas. Single-Family Open Space Development allows for the\npreservation of such property.\nExcess impervious surface area contributes to the volume and velocity of surface\nwater runoff, thereby increasing flooding potential. Establishing regulations\nrestricting impervious surface coverage will reduce flooding impacts caused by\ndevelopment and help to maintain the character of the community. Single-Family\nOpen Space Development achieves these objectives by establishing a Maximum\nDeveloped Site Area standard.\nThe Planning and Zoning Commission generally views a variety of housing\noptions as an enhancement to Darien. Housing that permits Darien residents to\n\"downsize\" is needed. Single-Family Open Space Development addresses this\nneed by allowing more than one single-family dwelling on a lot at a density no\ngreater than the existing zone theoretically allows, provided that such housing is\nappropriate for the specific lot and the neighborhood in general.\nSingle-Family Open Space Development is intended to apply to oversized lots as\nan alternative to subdivision. It reduces the intensity of development on lots with\nsensitive lands by deducting wetlands, steep slopes and flood zones from the lot\narea for density, coverage and floor area calculations. It protects neighboring\nproperties with buffers and setbacks equal to or greater than those required by the\nresidential zone in which the property is located and with architecture designed to\nharmonize with the neighborhood and surrounding uses.\nExcept as specifically provided herein, these regulations shall not legalize or be\nconstrued to legalize any residential use not lawfully existing at the time these\nregulations are adopted including but not limited to apartments, cottages, or any\nother residential use involving more than one dwelling unit on a single lot.\nX-16\n"}, {"page": "270", "text": "1052.2 Area and Bulk Requirements\nSingle-Family Open Space Development is only permitted in the R-1/5 and R-1/3\nResidential Zones in accordance with the Area and Bulk Requirements of\nSubsection 406 of these Regulations and the additional requirements noted below.\nThe requirements listed below for each zone shall be deemed to be the minimum\nor maximum requirements in every instance of their application.

The Planning and Zoning Commission wishes to amend the Zoning\nRegulations to specifically permit such enforcement practices and to establish a policy to have\nsuch notices filed in the Land Records whenever appropriate and to establish a procedure which\nis fair to the property owner.\nThe practice of filing notices in the Land Records is discretionary and would not be appropriate\nin every situation in which there is a zoning violation. It remains incumbent on anyone\ninterested in the property to check with the Zoning Enforcement Officer and other Town\nOfficials to determine if there is a violation on the property. It should not be assumed that if\nthere is not a Notice of Violation in the Land Records that there is no violation. The filing of the\nnotice in the Land Records would not preclude the sale, lease, or financing of the property, but at\nleast it would advise other persons of the problems and violations.\nThe following policies allow for a notice of violation to be filed in the Land Records and it is\nrequired that a notice of the release be filed in the Land Records when the situation is corrected.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1. The Zoning Enforcement Officer has issued a Cease and Desist Order and the owner of the\nproperty and/or tenant and/or violator have failed to comply with said order.\n2. The owner/tenant/violator have failed to appeal the Cease and Desist Order to the Zoning Board\nof Appeals, or the Zoning Board of Appeals has upheld the order, or portion of the order.\n3. The Zoning Enforcement Officer or Director of Planning and Zoning shall place the intent to\nfile a notice of violation in the Land Records on the Agenda of the Zoning Board of Appeals for\ndiscussion. Notice of time, date, and place of the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting shall be\nmailed to the owner/tenant/violator by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least seven (7)\ndays prior to the meeting. The owner/tenant/violator of the property shall be given an\nopportunity to appear before the Zoning Board of Appeals and show cause why a Notice of\nZoning Violation should not be filed in the Land Records.\n4. The Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize, in writing, the filing of the Notice of Zoning\nViolation in the Darien Land Records.\n5. If the Director of Planning and Zoning and/or the Zoning Enforcement Officer are aware of a\nsituation where time is of the essence such as a pending sale, lease, financing, or refinancing of\nthe property, they are authorized to file a Notice of Zoning Violation in the Land Records prior\nto a discussion with the Zoning Board of Appeals SO long as a proceeding is conducted by the\nZoning Board of Appeals within thirty days of the filing of the notice.\n6. When the violations have been corrected and all fines and/or penalties have been paid in full, the\nZoning Enforcement Officer shall file a Notice of Release of Zoning Violation in the Darien\nLand Records. If the owner/tenant/violator requests that the notice of release be filed, but the\nZoning Enforcement Officer decides that the property is still in violation of the Zoning\nPage D-1\n"}, {"page": "303", "text": "Regulations or the Cease and Desist Order, then the owner/tenant/violator may appeal that\ndecision to the Zoning Board of Appeals as per Section 1122 of the Darien Zoning Regulations.\nPage D-2\n"}, {"page": "304", "text": "APPENDIX E - EXAMPLES OF INCLUSIONARY ZONING CALCULATIONS\nA.
