The annual fee per space may be modified by the Commission on an annual basis\nsubject to a ninety (90) day notice and subject to documentation of the necessary\ncost per space. The fees are reflective of the gap between the expected revenue\ngenerated from the parking space and the cost of providing and maintaining the\nspace through a public/private mechanism. For initial PILOP payments the annual\ncost per space is $1,274. This is based on the estimated gap between the likely\nrevenue per structured parking space (approximately $1,274 per year, $103.50 per\nmonth or $4.70 per day), the capital cost ($2,276 per year at approximately 20\nyears at 5 percent interest and $25,000 per space development cost), and\noperating cost ($20 per space per month) of parking in any of the downtown village\ndistricts.\ng.

Upon application, the\nPlanning and Zoning Commission can further reduce the percent reduction.\n1. Each application will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The burden of\ndemonstration lies upon the applicant, who shall conduct or commission an\naccurate analysis of potential parking demand reduction enabled by the respective\ncomponents of their agreement(s). This analysis shall be conducted by a licensed\ntransportation engineer.\n2. No agreement shall be unreasonably denied if the applicant shows clear, accurate\nand demonstrable evidence of the parking reduction requested in the TDM\nagreement. Applications for parking reductions utilizing TDM agreements must\ninclude all components in Table 11-1-17, including the expected reduction\nin\nparking requirements. The agreement and request for reduction will then be\nreviewed by the zoning department or its consultant to determine if it is reasonable.\nIt is anticipated that the Planning and Zoning Commission may use the Parking\nDemand Adjustment Factors as benchmarks to determine the reasonableness of\nreduction allowances from the implementation of TDM programs.\n3. The TDM agreements will run as restrictive covenants with the land that shall be\nacceptable to the Office of the City Attorney. Should the developer fail to meet the\nparking requirements through reductions from shared parking or TDM agreements,\nthey will be responsible for making payments in lieu of parking requirements. TDM\nagreements should be monitored and reviewed on annual basis, or a regular basis\nas determined by the City.\n4. Shall the current building owner fail to continue any of the components of the\ntransportation demand management plan for which parking requirement\nreductions were allowed, the developer or building owner shall be levied by the\nCity a fee equivalent to the payment in lieu of parking for the amount of spaces\nthat would have been provided had that component of the TDM plan not been\ninitially approved.\n90\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "5.

Any building setback along primary or secondary frontages in the DVD-Core must be in the form of a sidewalk easement or covered arcade.\n2. Alleys between buildings created by contiguous side yard setbacks shall be covered at the street frontage by a gate or matching fa\u00e7ade so as to maintain street line continuity.\n3. A Public Access Easement may be required on any non-residential properties abutting a waterway. From the top of the embarkment and for twenty (20) feet inland, a dedicated open space area shall be established.\n4. See the provisions of 10-10-4 regarding building setback in the NCVD Zone.\n5. In flood plain areas where the lowest building floor is raised to meet the flood plain requirements, up to 30% of required street wall width could be recessed to accommodate ac\n6. When flood resistance construction requires raising the lowest floor height, front building setbacks may be increased by up to 25 feet to provide exterior stairs and ramps\n7. For Residential Use Only, the front setback may be increased up to 35 feet.\n8. Large parcels with multiple buildings shall maintain street wall along at least 60% of primary street frontage.\n9. Single use multifamily structures must provide a minimum setback of 10' of landscaped area.\n10. Can be increased an additional 5' to accommodate outdoor seating for food establishments.\n11.
