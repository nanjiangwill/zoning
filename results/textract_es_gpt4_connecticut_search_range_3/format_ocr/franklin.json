The area of the special flood hazard includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A\nand AE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Areas of special flood hazard are\ndetermined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood\nInsurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are\nonly approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for\na specific location.\nThe degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for\nregulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger\nfloods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural\ncauses. This regulation does not imply or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area\nor uses permitted in such areas will be free from flooding and flood damages. This regulation shall\nnot create liability on the part of the Town of Franklin or by any officer or employee thereof for any\nflood damages that result from reliance on this regulation or any administrative decision lawfully\nmade thereunder. The Town of Franklin, its officers and employees shall assume no liability for\nanother person's reliance on any maps, data or information provided by the Town of Franklin.\nThe following requirements are intended to reduce the threat to public safety and loss of property\nvalues resulting from periodic flooding and to ensure eligibility for continued participation by the Town\nof Franklin in the National Flood Insurance Program.

The following regulations apply within the SFHA:\n9.14.1 A zoning permit shall be required for all development (as defined in Section 9.14.10) within\nthe SFHA.

In the event that\ndata from sources other than the FIRM are utilized, the Commission shall select and adopt a\nregulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway\nmust be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface\nelevation of the flood more than one (1) foot at any point.\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "9.14.2 Within the SFHA:\nA.

The Town of Franklin has determined:\nThe Town of Franklin has maintained a system of sign regulations governing the location,\nsize and number of signs that can be erected in the Town. These regulations are intended to\ncreate a legal framework for a balanced system of signage to improve and enhance the Town\nof Franklin=s interests in promoting public safety, preventing traffic hazards, and creating an\naesthetically pleasing community. The Town finds that signs provide an important medium\nthrough which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left unregulated,\nsigns can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property\nvalues and the Town=s overall public welfare as an aesthetic concern.\nAs a result of its comprehensive sign regulations, and in particular its restrictions on the\nheight, area and location of signage, the Town of Franklin presents an aesthetically pleasing\nenvironment and provides for traffic substantially free of unsafe diversions.\nIt is not the intention of the Town and its enforcement efforts to interpret, restrict or regulate\nthe messages contained on signage in the Town.\n12.1.2. The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate the number, location, size, illumination, type, and\nuse of signs within the Town in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare; to\nmaintain, enhance and improve the environment of the town by preventing visual clutter that\nis harmful to traffic safety and the appearance of the community; to balance the rights\nof\npersons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected\nagainst the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and to ensure the fair and consistent\nenforcement of sign regulations, while providing for effective means of communication,\nconsistent with constitutional guarantees. This Chapter does not regulate, nor is it intended\nto regulate, the message displayed on any sign, building design, or any display not defined as\na sign.\n12.1.3 It is hereby declared unlawful for any person, corporation or entity to construct, place, install,\nalter, change, maintain, use or to permit the construction, placement, installation, alteration,\nchange, maintenance, or use of any sign contrary to or in violation of the provisions of this\nChapter.\n12.1.4 For the purposes of this Chapter the following definitions shall apply:\nSign; Any natural or artificial structure, object, device, light or display which is used to\nannounce, advertise, identify, or attract attention to any object, product, institution,\norganization, business, service, or location by any means, including but not limited to letter,\nnumber, banner, flag, insignia, device, designs, symbols, fixtures, colors, illumination or logo,\nand which is attached to the exterior of a building or structure or upon the ground, or\nsuspended from a structure natural or artificial, or permanently applied or attached to the\ninterior surface of a window and intended to be viewed from the outside.
