Nothing in this Section is intended to limit the ability to\nreplace or repair a nonconforming structure pursuant to Sections 17.8 and 17.9.\nSimilarly, within the districts established by these Regulations, there also exist certain\nuses of land or structures, which uses were lawful before the current Regulations were\npassed but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the present terms\nof these Regulations. Such uses (i.e. \"nonconforming\" uses) are declared by these\nRegulations to be compatible with permitted uses in their respective districts.
