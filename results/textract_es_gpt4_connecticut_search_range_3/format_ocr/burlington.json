Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of\nBurlington, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:\n2.\nFINDING OF FACT\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Burlington are subject to periodic flood\ninundation which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety\nhazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary\npublic expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax\nbase, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the\noccupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to\nother lands which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise\nunprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the\nfloodplains can adversely affect the community.\nThe Town of Burlington has voluntarily participated in the National Flood\nInsurance Program (NFIP) since 6/1/1981. The NFIP is founded on a mutual\nagreement between the federal government and each participating community.\nLocal, state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to\nmeet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The community's role is of\nparamount importance. Property owners are able to receive federally-\nsubsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the\nminimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the NFIP.\n3.\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development, promote\npublic health, safety, and general welfare, and minimize public and private losses\ndue to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\na.\nTo protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;\nb.\nTo minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;\nC.\nTo minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with\nflooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\nd.\nTo minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic\ndisruptions;\ne.\nTo minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such\nas water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets\nand bridges, located in the floodplain;\nf.\nTo help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\ndevelopment of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize\nflood damage and flood blight areas;\n27\n"}, {"page": "28", "text": "g.\nTo insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood\nhazard area;\nh.\nTo prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage\nand result in conflicts between property owners;\ni.\nTo ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume\nresponsibility for their actions; and\nj.\nTo discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable\nalternative to locate the activity, use or structure outside of the\nfloodplain.\n4.\nOBJECTIVES\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes objectives,\nmethods and provisions that:\n5.\nDEFINITIONS:\nSee Section II.

This theme is associated with certain visual elements and\norganizing principles. The retention of a central town green and the\nenhancement of a consistent look or architectural theme in a Central Business\nDistrict is a conscious goal herein.\na.\nArchitectural styles are to have a colonial theme with a strong sense of\nhistory and tradition. Building materials may include clapboard, shingle,\nbrick and stone. Roofs are flat or steeply pitched. Fenestration is to be\nvertically proportioned.\nb.\nModern buildings undergoing renovation, improvement or enlargement or\nnew construction should be renovated or constructed with compatible\nmaterials, colors and signage, consistent with the standards set\nthroughout the Central Business District.\n10.\nSIGNAGE\nIn order to accommodate both pedestrian and vehicular signage needs, a\nhierarchical signage system for any Central Business District is established.\nLarger signs may be located to announce the district, extend welcome, indicate\nmerchants located within, and give directions to public parking. This may occur,\nfor example, at strategically located \"gateway\" elements. Once within the District,\nindividual store signs can identify the merchandise available within. These\npedestrian signs should be smaller scaled and appropriately sized for the\nstorefront they announce. Larger and more garish signs are usually associated\nwith the commercial strip and the automobile and are to be discouraged and not\nallowed. Backlit, translucent canopies, neon, flashing digital signs or other similar\nsigns should be discouraged and not utilized.\nSigns must be constructed and placed in conformity with the Burlington Zoning\nRegulations and must be located so they do not obscure architectural features of\nhistoric buildings. In order to create some sense of harmony throughout the\nDistrict, the same design criteria should be applied to all buildings.\n116\n"}, {"page": "117", "text": "APPENDIX C BURLINGTON CENTRAL BUSINESS ZONE DESIGN GUIDELINES\n1.\nBUILDING PLACEMENT\na.\nThe placement of buildings towards the front of the lot and parking space\nto the rear is strongly encouraged.\nb.\nPrimary entrances to buildings should be oriented toward the front\nsidewalk and street.\n2.\nBUILDING ARTICULATION\na.\nThe building street wall must provide significant modulation in horizontal\nand vertical rhythms that facilitates a lively relationship between\nmaterials, light, shadow, texture, and solids and voids. Such modulation\nmay include, but is not limited to: windows; doors; building bulb-outs;\nbuilding recesses; fa\u00e7ade materials; and specific architectural elements\nsuch as columns, cornices, sills, distinct bands between floors, and other\nornamentation. As a general rule, building modulations should occur at\nleast every 25 to 30 feet of street wall length.\nb.\nBuildings shall have a significant level of transparency along the ground\nfloor fronting on any sidewalk or street. In general, the ground floor\nfa\u00e7ade should be broken up by windows, doors, or other transparent\nelements that are subdivided appropriately, where practical. Utilization of\nplate glass is permitted but the inclusion of grills or other means of\ncreating the look of small panes is strongly encouraged.\nC.\nMechanical equipment located outside of a building must be screened\nfrom view on all sides in a manner that is architecturally consistent and\nintegrative with the associated building.\nd.\nFlat roofs are discouraged. Roof treatments shall be harmonious with the\nbuilt form of the surrounding area. Cornices, roof terraces and other\narchitectural elements that aid in visually terminating the roofline of a\nbuilding are strongly encouraged and shall be continued around the entire\nperimeter of the building.\ne.\nBay windows, balconies, and other functional or ornamental architectural\nelements may project a maximum of three (3) feet beyond the front\nproperty set-back line. Awnings must be professionally manufactured\nand mounted. They must be well maintained, and the lawning frame must\nbe located no lower than seven feet six inches (7'6\") above the ground.\nBright colors are acceptable, but gaudy or loud patterns on lawnings are\nnot allowed.\n3.\nFA\u00c7ADE DESIGN\na.\nFa\u00e7ade material for buildings within the Central Business Zone should\nreflect the preponderance of material types used in the center of\nBurlington. The use of brick, stone and wood in the building fa\u00e7ades is\nstrongly encouraged. Other materials may be utilized provided they\nproduce a level of detailing and quality construction consistent with\nbuilding fa\u00e7ades of brick, stone and wood.\nb.\nThe colors of fa\u00e7ade materials of a building should generally coordinate\nwith, but not necessarily match, the colors used in other building fa\u00e7ades\nalong the same block. Unusual, bright, or contrasting colors should be\nlimited to the details of the building fa\u00e7ade.\n4.\nPARKING\na.\nSurface parking lots should be located to the rear of buildings.\n117\n"}, {"page": "118", "text": "b.\nConsolidated parcels with common access for ingress, egress and\nparking purposes are strongly encouraged.

Construction of additions should seek to minimize\nthe loss of historic materials on exterior walls.
