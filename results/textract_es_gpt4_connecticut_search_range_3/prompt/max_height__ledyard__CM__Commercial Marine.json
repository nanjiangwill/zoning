These regulations are applicable to Small Wind Energy Systems designed for on-site residential,\nfarm, and small private commercial uses. \"Small Wind Energy System\" means a wind energy system that\n(1)\nis used to generate electricity;\n(2)\nhas a nameplate capacity of 50 kilowatts or less; and\n(3)\nhas a tower height of 100 feet or less.\n(a)\n\"Tower\" means the monopole, freestanding, or guyed structure that supports a wind generator.\n(b) \"Total height\" means the vertical distance from ground level to the tip of a wind generator blade\nwhen the tip is at its highest point.\n(4)\n\"Wind energy system\" means equipment that converts and then stores or transfers energy from\nthe wind into usable forms of energy. This equipment includes any base, blade, foundation,\ngenerator, nacelle, rotor, tower, transformer, vane, wire, inverter, batteries or other component\nused in the system.\nC.\nA small wind energy system as defined in these zoning regulations, is permitted in accordance with the\nSchedule of Uses, provided the following regulations are met:\n(1)\nA Small Wind Energy System shall provide electricity only in support of a principal or accessory use\nof the parcel on which it is located.\n(2)\nA maximum of one (1) Small Wind Energy System shall be allowed on any parcel.\n(3) Setbacks. A wind tower for a Small Wind Energy System shall be set back a distance equal to its\ntotal height (including its top rotor tip) from:\n(a)\nany public road right of way.\n(b)\nany overhead utility lines\n(c)\nall property lines.\n(4)\nSmall Wind Energy Systems, including towers or alternative turbine support structures, and\nsupporting guy wires (if any), shall not be located in any front yard or encroach on any setbacks.\n(5) Intentionally Left Blank\n(6)\nThe small wind energy system shall be designed and sited such that entry onto abutting property is\nnot required for its installation, removal, maintenance, or repair. A Small Wind Energy System shall\nnot be permitted if it requires an easement OR variance for installation, removal, noise,\nelectromagnetic interference, fall radius, maintenance, replacement, or other purpose.\n3/9/2020\n82.\n", "page_number": 84, "page_range": [84, 85, 86], "highlight": ["parking or outdoor sales display areas are in front of the building, a buffer strip not less than\ntwelve <em>feet</em>", "by an\naisle between rows of parking spaces.\n10.4\nCommercial, Industrial, & Special Use Districts (I, <em>CM</em>", "Any use permitted in a Commercial District (<em>CM</em>, NC, or CIP) and not specifically mentioned in the parking", "table requires one (1) space per one hundred fifty (150) square <em>feet</em> of gross floor area plus one (1", "of 100 <em>feet</em> or less."], "score": 17.095392, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Commercial Marine\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CM\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CM\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CM\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}]]}
