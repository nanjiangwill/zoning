You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Commercial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"C\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, single family residence, single family, single-family, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer.

Permits are required for cluster\nhousing, condominiums, under Chapter 825 of the Connecticut General Statutes, and multiple dwellings on\na single lot.\n2. The minimum lot size for any multiple dwellings shall be determined by the criteria in TABLE 2 (page 19).\n3. Applications for a permit must comply with special permit requirements.\nRequirements for Multiple Dwellings\na. Any proposed project must have access to a public street.\nb. Any project which requires interior roads shall provide for the construction of roads that comply\nwith the standards for construction of town roads, as illustrated in figures #1 and #2 and made a\npart of this ordinance.\nC.\nAll projects shall also provide for the construction of sidewalks along each public road and along\neach road to be constructed, in accordance with figure #4 and made a part of this ordinance.\nd. All minimum site distances shall comply with figure #5, and made a part of this ordinance.\ne. Plans shall indicate that during the period of excavation, filling or removal, such barriers or fences\nshall be erected as necessary for the protection of pedestrians and vehicles.\nf.\nTruck access to the site shall be arranged as to minimize danger to traffic and nuisance to\nsurrounding properties. That portion of the access road within the site shall be maintained in such\ncondition as not to constitute a nuisance.\ng. When excavation, filling or removal operations, or any of them are completed, the disturbed area\nshall be graded so that no gradients in disturbed earth shall be steeper than a slope of three to one\n(horizontal to vertical). All debris shall be removed or buried. The area shall be seeded with a\nperennial rye grass or equally suitable vegetation and maintained until approved by the\nCommission.\nh. There will be no excavation, fill, or removal within 50 feet of any property or street line except to\nan elevation equal with or above the established grade of the adjoining street or property.\ni.\nBuildings shall be so located on the lot as to provide for the amenities of suburban living, to assure\nthe maximum of light and ventilation, to control the impact of traffic and parking on the site, and\nintegrate the development with the neighborhood.\nj.\nOff street parking spaces shall be provided in garage, carport, or parking lot on the same lot,\ntotaling not less than two spaces for each dwelling unit.\nk.\nDriveways shall be established for each unit in accordance with figure #3.\nI.\nNo units shall be constructed unless an appropriate drainage plan has been established and will not\ncreate a hazard of storm water runoff, or undue accumulation of surface water.\nm. No permit may be approved without the following:\n1) Proper provision for vehicle traffic, control of entrance from an exit to highway, and adequate\nparking.\n41\n\n\nNEW PAGE 42\n2) Proper provision for pedestrian traffic, including sidewalks;\n3) Proper provision for water supply, and for the disposal of storm water and sanitary sewage, in\naccordance with this ordinance and with the requirements of other departments of the town\nand the Fire District\nn. In any case where septic systems will provide inadequate for the appropriate disposal of waste, no\npermit may be granted unless appropriate provision has been made and approval been given for\nconnection to the Fire District services for septic disposal.\nO. Except for driveways giving access to public streets, all buildings, driveways and parking areas shall\nbe not less than 25 feet from the nearest property line.\np. No permit may be granted unless the land is suitable for multiple dwellings. Land subject to\nperiodic flooding, poor drainage, steep slopes, or a specific hazardous condition, shall not be\nconsidered suitable. Land with inadequate capacity for subsurface sewage disposal shall not be\nconsidered appropriate unless connected to public sewers.\nq.\nA major consideration in determining the buildability of land is the slope. Among the factors to be\nconsidered when dealing with slope conditions:\n1) Access to site - suitable and safe access to the building site must be available, for the\nmaximum allowable driveway slope of 15%.\n2) Soil conditions - the soil conditions present on the site must allow an adequate area for a septic\nsystem installation including a useable reserve septic area.\n3) Character of surrounding land - surrounding land use must be compatible with the proposed\nuse of the property.\n4) Intensity of development in area - land areas of steep slopes severely limits the intensity of\ndevelopment that can be sustained in a manner which protects the public health and safety.\n5) Relief - any proposed building with steep slopes must contain a natural area of relief providing\nfor a building site and sewage disposal area.\n6) It must be stressed that all slope considerations are to be applied to land in its natural state.\nAny drastic or extensive manmade slope provisions will not be considered an improvement\nupon or betterment of the building site's suitability. It is the express intent of this ordinance to\nprotect topographically self-preserving land, and in that way preserve land, and in that way\npreserve the natural beauty and rural character of North Canaan. The provisions of this\nregulation will be applied to land as it existed before manmade changes.\nr.\nAny deviation from any plans submitted and the above conditions shall be cause for the\nCommission to revoke the permit.\nS.\nBefore the permit is granted the applicant shall file a performance bond with the Treasurer of the\nTown of North Canaan, in a form approved by the Town Attorney, and in such amount as the\nCommission shall deem necessary to ensure compliance with the conditions set forth in Section b,\nC, I, n.\nH.

Buffer Strip\nIn the Housatonic River Overlay Zone Inner Corridor the Buffer Strip is the area between the River's\nordinary high water mark and 75 feet inland which is designed for the purposes of protecting water\nquality by aiding the infiltration and cleansing of surface storm water runoff, maintaining river bank\nstabilization, controlling erosion from the site to the river and associated wetlands, to provide shade\nfor river fisheries and habitat and to assist in screening the view of development from the river.\n2. Ordinary High Water Mark\nIn the Housatonic River Overlay Zone Inner Corridor the ordinary high water mark is the line along the\nriver bank where the presence and action of the river water creates an obvious transition zone\nbetween the river and the normally dry land above it. The area within the ordinary high water mark\ninclude land that is marked by river water flow created erosion, especially in areas with a steep bank,\nthe presence of a gravel stream bank, areas where there is the destruction or prevention of woody\nterrestrial vegetation, areas where aquatic vegetation is predominant or other easily recognized\ncharacteristic of the active river channel.\n3. Buildable Area\nA rectangular area of a lot that contains no wetlands soils, water bodies, watercourses, utilities or\naccess easements, rights of way or any naturally occurring slope exceeding 25% as measured using 2\nfoot contour intervals. Within the Housatonic River Corridor Overlay Zone Inner Corridor in addition to\nthe above such rectangular area shall contain no land within the FEMA Identified Flood Hazard Area.\n4. Low Impact Stormwater Control Measures\nLow Impact Stormwater Controls in the HROZ Inner Corridor involved use of natural methods to\ncontrol and treat stormwater runoff such as land conservation measures, treating stormwater runoff\nmovement using vegetation and landscape features, use of other multiple natural based, non-\nstructural measures to reduce and cleanse runoff and prevent pollution. Examples include rain\ngardens, grass swales, and use of cisterns and rain barrels to collect and reuse runoff. Appropriate Low\nImpact Stormwater Controls are found in numerous publications including the Connecticut Stormwater\nQuality Manual.\nD Inner Corridor Requirements: The Inner Corridor includes the requirement to maintain a Buffer Strip\nconsisting of the land within 75 feet of the River's ordinary high water mark as defined herein which is\nregulated to meet the purposes of the overlay zone, especially to protect and preserve water quality,\nprevent erosion, maintain wildlife habitat and protect river fisheries.\n1.
