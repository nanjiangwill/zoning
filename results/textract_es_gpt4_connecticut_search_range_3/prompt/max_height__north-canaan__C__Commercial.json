You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Commercial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"C\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max building height, max height, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_height in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

The new building cannot exceed the height of the highest existing building within the complex.\nARTICLE X. NON-CONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES\nA. Statement of Intent\nWithin the districts established by this regulation or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, uses\nand structures which were lawful before this regulation was passed or amended, but which should be prohibited,\nregulated or restricted under the terms of this regulation or future amendment.\nSuch uses are declared by this regulation to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is the\nintent of this regulation to permit these non-conformities to continue so long as they are not enlarged upon,\nexpanded or extended, if such a change increases the non-conformity, or is used as grounds for adding other\nstructures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. A change in ownership in no way affects the status of\nthe non-conforming lot, use, or structure.\nA non- conforming use of a structure, use of land or non-conforming use of a structure and land shall not be\nextended or enlarged after passage of this regulation by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs\nintended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which could be prohibited\ngenerally in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this regulation shall be deemed to require a\nchange in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction, or designated\nuse of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of the adoption of\nthis regulation.\nB.
