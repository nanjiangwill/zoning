You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Commercial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"C\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max lot coverage, building coverage, lot coverage, pervious surface, building area as % of lot, coverage, maximum lot coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_lot_coverage in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

Statement of Intent\nWithin the districts established by this regulation or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, uses\nand structures which were lawful before this regulation was passed or amended, but which should be prohibited,\nregulated or restricted under the terms of this regulation or future amendment.\nSuch uses are declared by this regulation to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is the\nintent of this regulation to permit these non-conformities to continue so long as they are not enlarged upon,\nexpanded or extended, if such a change increases the non-conformity, or is used as grounds for adding other\nstructures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. A change in ownership in no way affects the status of\nthe non-conforming lot, use, or structure.\nA non- conforming use of a structure, use of land or non-conforming use of a structure and land shall not be\nextended or enlarged after passage of this regulation by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs\nintended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which could be prohibited\ngenerally in the district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this regulation shall be deemed to require a\nchange in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction, or designated\nuse of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of the adoption of\nthis regulation.\nB.

Non-Conforming Uses of Land\nWhere, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation lawful use of land exists that is made no\nlonger permissible under the terms of this regulation as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long\nas it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:\n1. No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area\nof land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation.\n2. No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part any other portion of the lot or\nparcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation.\n3. If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than two years,\nany subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this regulation for\nthe district in which such land is located.\nD. Non-Conforming Structures\nWhere a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation that could not be\nbuilt under the terms of this regulations by reason of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other\ncharacteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains\notherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:\n1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-conformity.\n2. Should such structure be destroyed or damaged, it may be repaired or replaced to an extent which\ndoes not increase the non-conformity. If such repair or replacement is not accomplished within\ntwo years, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this regulation.\n3. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter be\nsubject to the requirements of the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is\nmoved.\nE.
