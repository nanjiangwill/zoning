You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Designed Residence\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-D\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max lot coverage, building coverage, lot coverage, pervious surface, building area as % of lot, coverage, maximum lot coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_lot_coverage in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

[GRANDFATHERED STATUS FOR LEGALLY NON-CONFORMING USES]\nAny Building or use of land or Building legally existing at the time of enactment of this\nRegulation, or of any amendments thereto, or authorized lawful permit issued prior to the adoption\nof these Regulations which does not conform to the provisions of these Regulations for the Use\nDistricts in which it is located, shall be designated a non-conforming use. Such use may be\ncontinued but may not be extended or expanded, or changed to a less restrictive use as listed in the\nLAND USE SCHEDULE in APPENDIX A.\n10.B. [LIMITATIONS TO THE CONTINUATION OF NON-CONFORMING USES]\nThe total structural repairs and alterations that may be made in a Structure which is non-\nconforming in use only shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value at the time of\napplication for the first structural change, unless changed to a conforming use. The foregoing\nprovision in this Subsection with reference to limitations on structural repairs and alterations need\nnot apply to that part of any Building used for residence purposes located in any Business or\nIndustrial District, not conforming to the SCHEDULE OF REQUIREMENTS FOR AREA,\nHEIGHT AND BULK OF BUILDINGS in APPENDIX B, except that no additional dwelling units\nshall be permitted in any such Building in which structural repairs or alterations are undertaken\nunless the density provisions of SCHEDULE OF REQUIREMENTS for minimum number of\nsquare feet of Lot Area per family can be complied with for the district in which such Building is\nlocated.\n10.C.

[EXPIRATION OF GRANDFATHERED NON-CONFORMINGl USES]\nA Building Structure or portion thereof, non-conforming as to use, which is, or hereafter becomes\nvacant or remains unoccupied for a continuous period of one (1) year shall not thereafter be\noccupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the district in which it is\nlocated.\n10-1\n\n\nNEW PAGE 316\nAugust 31, 2021\n10.E.

No\nnew Permitted Uses, Structures or Buildings shall be established on any Lot supporting a use of\nland or use of a Structure that is non-conforming with respect to the Permitted Uses of Appendix\nA that would increase the degree of non-conformity or exceed the maximum intensity of use\npermitted for the district. Intensity of non-residential uses shall be equated on a residential density\nbasis of not more than 800 square feet of gross non-residential floor area per dwelling unit, or such\nlesser amount deemed appropriate based on the character of the non-residential use.

Incidental uses may also be allowed, such as\nschool or educational uses, tutoring and extra-curricular classroom and lecture areas, and art studio\nspace, and other supplemental uses provided that:\n1. No structural change is made to the exterior of the Building except as is necessary to provide\naccess for handicapped persons, for code compliance, or for customary repair and\nmaintenance; and no increase in legally nonconforming floor area.\n2. Where the existing number and design of Parking Spaces and access thereto is legally\nnonconforming, the Zoning Board may (a) allow such nonconformities to remain, and/or (b)\napprove an alternate design that decreases the nonconformities and where the Zoning Board\nmakes a determination that the proposed plan provides for adequate parking.
