General provisions.\nPlanned Residential Development (PRD) is a use of land, buildings and other structures specified\nin 273-16.D. and in Table 4 as permitted in residential districts by special permit under the\nrequirements of this article. The sections that follow set forth the criteria for approval of PRD\nspecial permits, as well as the standards for approval of PRD project design and management\nprograms. While the PRD use is not mandatory for the development of residential areas of the\nTown, it is the intent of the Plan of Conservation and Development to encourage PRD's that can\nconform to special permit criteria. Application and review procedures for PRD's are set forth in\n$\u00a7273-100. and 273-101.\n$273-83. Criteria for special permit.\nA.\nFindings. The Town of Guilford will experience continuing residential growth. For most of\nthe period of time that zoning regulations have been in effect for the Town, new\nresidential development has typically consisted of single-family dwellings on individual\nbuilding lots in new subdivision layouts. There is a continuing backlog of unused but\napproved building lots.\n(1)\nIn the aggregate, these layouts, while providing sites for additional dwellings,\nhave also:\n(a)\nConsumed large amounts of acreage that previously contained\nagricultural, forest and conservation resources.\n(b)\nResulted in construction of many miles of new streets requiring Town\nmaintenance.\n(c)\nBeen randomly scattered around the Town and have necessitated undue\nextension of municipal services.\n(d)\nCaused damage to or have failed to fit the natural features of the\nenvironment.\n(e)\nProduced housing that is beyond the means of or fails to meet the needs\nof a substantial segment of Guilford families.\n(2)\nSince 1969 and as an alternative to typical subdivision layouts, the regulations\nhave also provided for PRD's, consisting of single-family detached dwellings or\nattached dwellings, garden apartments or townhouses, upon grant of a special\npermit. Prior to the effective date of this section, approved PRD's have increased\nthe supply of alternative dwelling types and have become the more marketable\nform of housing construction. There is a backlog of approved but unbuilt dwelling\nunits in PRD's. It is found that the PRD's:\n(a)\nMay encourage a faster rate of growth than established under the\nGrowth Management Program of the Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment.\n(b)\nHave not materially produced housing within the means of lower-income\nGuilford families.\n\nNEW PAGE 73\n273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(c)\nHave in some cases produced architectural effects and grouping of\npopulation not in harmony with existing neighborhoods.\n(d)\nHave not in some cases fitted building and site development to the\nnatural features of the environment.\n(3)\nThere are tracts of land in the Town which, subject to consideration on a case-\nby-case basis, are capable of use under alternative forms of residential\ndevelopment that avoid the above results and accomplish the objectives\nhereinafter specified.\nB.\nObjectives. A PRD shall consist of single-family detached dwellings or attached\ndwellings, garden apartments or townhouses or a combination thereof which achieve\nboth of the following primary objectives:\n(1)\nPreservation of open space, such as open space resources and/or conservation\nresource areas, as set forth in Program Nos. 1 and 5 of the Plan of Conservation\nand Development for the Town of Guilford, Connecticut, and which is either:\n(a)\nSignificantly beneficial to the community by preserving unusual open\nspace features within the PRD or constituting part of an open space and\nconservation resource system covering a larger area; or\n(b)\nA significant portion of and enhancement to the design of the PRD by\nachieving a contrast between building and nonbuilding areas and\nsupporting the character of the neighborhood and the community.\n(2)\nArchitecture and site development of design merit, contributing to the\nappearance and beauty of the Town and achieving convenience of residential\nliving and economies in the use of energy and in all cases shall also:\n(a)\nBe located on a tract of land having the capability of supporting such\nalternative form of development;\n(b)\nHave a harmonious relationship to adjacent neighborhoods, such as,\nwith regard to but not limited to, the location and bulk of buildings,\nmaintenance of privacy and traffic access; and\n(c)\nConstitute a form of residential development which achieves both of the\nabove objectives in a manner more effective than a subdivision of\nindividual building lots permitted on the tract.\nC.\nAdditional objectives. PRD's may also, and are encouraged to, achieve positive\npreservation of farmland in active use and other managed open space and lower-cost\ndwelling units, and, in support thereof, PRD's which achieve these objectives may\ncontain additional dwelling units, as long as the primary objectives are also achieved.\nD.\nArea requirements. The following land area and dwelling unit density requirements are\napplicable to any Planned Residential Development (PRD):\n(1)\nTract. The tract or lot containing a PRD shall have at least the following minimum\narea of contiguous, predominantly undeveloped land; provided, however, that\na special permit for a PRD on a tract of lesser area may, at the discretion of the\nCommission, be approved when the PRD contains an open space reservation\nwhich adjoins and supports a permanent open space reservation on another lot.\n\nNEW PAGE 74\n273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(2)\nDwelling units. The maximum number of dwelling units in a PRD is determined\nbased in part upon a computation of the number of bedrooms (see $273-2.C. for\nthe definition of \"bedroom\") in relation to land area and land constraints within the\nPRD as follows:\n(a)\nFirst, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is determined by\nsubtracting the area of the following land constraints from the total PRD\nland area:\n[1]\nThe area of existing wetlands (see $273-2. for the definition of\n\"wetlands\");\n[2]\nThe area of existing watercourses (see $273-2. for the definition\nof \"watercourses\") having, at seasonal high flow or\nimpoundment, an area of 1/2 acre or more; and\n[3]\nThe significant area of steep slopes (greater than 25%).\n(b)\nIn Zones R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7, the net square-foot land\narea of the PRD is divided by the following factor designated for each\ndistrict and multiplied by 3.75 bedrooms:\n(c)\nIn Zone R-8, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is divided by a\nfactor of 80,000 and multiplied by 2.75 bedrooms.\n(d)\nWithin this maximum bedroom count, the number of bedrooms in each\ndwelling unit may be varied, provided that the total number of bedrooms\ndoes not exceed such count. In no PRD, however, shall there be less\nthan 9,000 square feet of net square-foot land area for each dwelling\nunit. When the PRD tract includes land in two or more zone districts in\nzones R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7 the total number of\nbedrooms will be calculated as above for each area in a separate district\nand added to determine the total allowed. The concentration of dwelling\nunits to be allowed by the Commission in any portion or section of a PRD\nwill be based upon the type of public utilities and facilities provided\nto\nadequately serve this density and to meet the public health standards as\nCELL (1, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (1, 2): \nAcres\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4\nCELL (2, 2): \n10 except where at least 1 affordable

General provisions.\nPlanned Residential Development (PRD) is a use of land, buildings and other structures specified\nin 273-16.D. and in Table 4 as permitted in residential districts by special permit under the\nrequirements of this article. The sections that follow set forth the criteria for approval of PRD\nspecial permits, as well as the standards for approval of PRD project design and management\nprograms. While the PRD use is not mandatory for the development of residential areas of the\nTown, it is the intent of the Plan of Conservation and Development to encourage PRD's that can\nconform to special permit criteria. Application and review procedures for PRD's are set forth in\n$\u00a7273-100. and 273-101.\n$273-83. Criteria for special permit.\nA.\nFindings. The Town of Guilford will experience continuing residential growth. For most of\nthe period of time that zoning regulations have been in effect for the Town, new\nresidential development has typically consisted of single-family dwellings on individual\nbuilding lots in new subdivision layouts. There is a continuing backlog of unused but\napproved building lots.\n(1)\nIn the aggregate, these layouts, while providing sites for additional dwellings,\nhave also:\n(a)\nConsumed large amounts of acreage that previously contained\nagricultural, forest and conservation resources.\n(b)\nResulted in construction of many miles of new streets requiring Town\nmaintenance.\n(c)\nBeen randomly scattered around the Town and have necessitated undue\nextension of municipal services.\n(d)\nCaused damage to or have failed to fit the natural features of the\nenvironment.\n(e)\nProduced housing that is beyond the means of or fails to meet the needs\nof a substantial segment of Guilford families.\n(2)\nSince 1969 and as an alternative to typical subdivision layouts, the regulations\nhave also provided for PRD's, consisting of single-family detached dwellings or\nattached dwellings, garden apartments or townhouses, upon grant of a special\npermit. Prior to the effective date of this section, approved PRD's have increased\nthe supply of alternative dwelling types and have become the more marketable\nform of housing construction. There is a backlog of approved but unbuilt dwelling\nunits in PRD's. It is found that the PRD's:\n(a)\nMay encourage a faster rate of growth than established under the\nGrowth Management Program of the Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment.\n(b)\nHave not materially produced housing within the means of lower-income\nGuilford families.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 73\n273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(c)\nHave in some cases produced architectural effects and grouping of\npopulation not in harmony with existing neighborhoods.\n(d)\nHave not in some cases fitted building and site development to the\nnatural features of the environment.\n(3)\nThere are tracts of land in the Town which, subject to consideration on a case-\nby-case basis, are capable of use under alternative forms of residential\ndevelopment that avoid the above results and accomplish the objectives\nhereinafter specified.\nB.\nObjectives. A PRD shall consist of single-family detached dwellings or attached\ndwellings, garden apartments or townhouses or a combination thereof which achieve\nboth of the following primary objectives:\n(1)\nPreservation of open space, such as open space resources and/or conservation\nresource areas, as set forth in Program Nos. 1 and 5 of the Plan of Conservation\nand Development for the Town of Guilford, Connecticut, and which is either:\n(a)\nSignificantly beneficial to the community by preserving unusual open\nspace features within the PRD or constituting part of an open space and\nconservation resource system covering a larger area; or\n(b)\nA significant portion of and enhancement to the design of the PRD by\nachieving a contrast between building and nonbuilding areas and\nsupporting the character of the neighborhood and the community.\n(2)\nArchitecture and site development of design merit, contributing to the\nappearance and beauty of the Town and achieving convenience of residential\nliving and economies in the use of energy and in all cases shall also:\n(a)\nBe located on a tract of land having the capability of supporting such\nalternative form of development;\n(b)\nHave a harmonious relationship to adjacent neighborhoods, such as,\nwith regard to but not limited to, the location and bulk of buildings,\nmaintenance of privacy and traffic access; and\n(c)\nConstitute a form of residential development which achieves both of the\nabove objectives in a manner more effective than a subdivision of\nindividual building lots permitted on the tract.\nC.\nAdditional objectives. PRD's may also, and are encouraged to, achieve positive\npreservation of farmland in active use and other managed open space and lower-cost\ndwelling units, and, in support thereof, PRD's which achieve these objectives may\ncontain additional dwelling units, as long as the primary objectives are also achieved.\nD.\nArea requirements. The following land area and dwelling unit density requirements are\napplicable to any Planned Residential Development (PRD):\n(1)\nTract. The tract or lot containing a PRD shall have at least the following minimum\narea of contiguous, predominantly undeveloped land; provided, however, that\na special permit for a PRD on a tract of lesser area may, at the discretion of the\nCommission, be approved when the PRD contains an open space reservation\nwhich adjoins and supports a permanent open space reservation on another lot.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 74\n273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(2)\nDwelling units. The maximum number of dwelling units in a PRD is determined\nbased in part upon a computation of the number of bedrooms (see $273-2.C. for\nthe definition of \"bedroom\") in relation to land area and land constraints within the\nPRD as follows:\n(a)\nFirst, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is determined by\nsubtracting the area of the following land constraints from the total PRD\nland area:\n[1]\nThe area of existing wetlands (see $273-2. for the definition of\n\"wetlands\");\n[2]\nThe area of existing watercourses (see $273-2. for the definition\nof \"watercourses\") having, at seasonal high flow or\nimpoundment, an area of 1/2 acre or more; and\n[3]\nThe significant area of steep slopes (greater than 25%).\n(b)\nIn Zones R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7, the net square-foot land\narea of the PRD is divided by the following factor designated for each\ndistrict and multiplied by 3.75 bedrooms:\n(c)\nIn Zone R-8, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is divided by a\nfactor of 80,000 and multiplied by 2.75 bedrooms.\n(d)\nWithin this maximum bedroom count, the number of bedrooms in each\ndwelling unit may be varied, provided that the total number of bedrooms\ndoes not exceed such count. In no PRD, however, shall there be less\nthan 9,000 square feet of net square-foot land area for each dwelling\nunit. When the PRD tract includes land in two or more zone districts in\nzones R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7 the total number of\nbedrooms will be calculated as above for each area in a separate district\nand added to determine the total allowed. The concentration of dwelling\nunits to be allowed by the Commission in any portion or section of a PRD\nwill be based upon the type of public utilities and facilities provided\nto\nadequately serve this density and to meet the public health standards as\nCELL (1, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (1, 2): \nAcres\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4\nCELL (2, 2): \n10 except where at least 1 affordable housing\nunit is provided and then 5\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-5, R-6 and R-7\nCELL (3, 2): \n15, except where at least 1 affordable housing\nunit is provided and then 7\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-8\nCELL (4, 2): \n25\nCELL (1, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (1, 2): \nFactor\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-1, R-2 and R-3\nCELL (2, 2): \n20,000\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-4\nCELL (3, 2): \n30,000\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-5\nCELL (4, 2): \n40,000\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-6\nCELL (5, 2): \n60,000\nCELL (6, 1): \nR-7\nCELL (6, 2): \n80,000\n\n\nNEW PAGE 75\n273-.83\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-84.\nestablished in the State Sanitary Code and upon the amount and\nlocation of open space provided.\n(4)\nAffordable dwelling units.

Guilford\n273-83.\nARTICLE XI\nPlanned Residential Developments\n$273-82. General provisions.\nPlanned Residential Development (PRD) is a use of land, buildings and other structures specified\nin 273-16.D. and in Table 4 as permitted in residential districts by special permit under the\nrequirements of this article. The sections that follow set forth the criteria for approval of PRD\nspecial permits, as well as the standards for approval of PRD project design and management\nprograms. While the PRD use is not mandatory for the development of residential areas of the\nTown, it is the intent of the Plan of Conservation and Development to encourage PRD's that can\nconform to special permit criteria. Application and review procedures for PRD's are set forth in\n$\u00a7273-100. and 273-101.\n$273-83. Criteria for special permit.\nA.\nFindings. The Town of Guilford will experience continuing residential growth. For most of\nthe period of time that zoning regulations have been in effect for the Town, new\nresidential development has typically consisted of single-family dwellings on individual\nbuilding lots in new subdivision layouts. There is a continuing backlog of unused but\napproved building lots.\n(1)\nIn the aggregate, these layouts, while providing sites for additional dwellings,\nhave also:\n(a)\nConsumed large amounts of acreage that previously contained\nagricultural, forest and conservation resources.\n(b)\nResulted in construction of many miles of new streets requiring Town\nmaintenance.\n(c)\nBeen randomly scattered around the Town and have necessitated undue\nextension of municipal services.\n(d)\nCaused damage to or have failed to fit the natural features of the\nenvironment.\n(e)\nProduced housing that is beyond the means of or fails to meet the needs\nof a substantial segment of Guilford families.\n(2)\nSince 1969 and as an alternative to typical subdivision layouts, the regulations\nhave also provided for PRD's, consisting of single-family detached dwellings or\nattached dwellings, garden apartments or townhouses, upon grant of a special\npermit. Prior to the effective date of this section, approved PRD's have increased\nthe supply of alternative dwelling types and have become the more marketable\nform of housing construction. There is a backlog of approved but unbuilt dwelling\nunits in PRD's. It is found that the PRD's:\n(a)\nMay encourage a faster rate of growth than established under the\nGrowth Management Program of the Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment.\n(b)\nHave not materially produced housing within the means of lower-income\nGuilford families.\n\nNEW PAGE 73\n273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(c)\nHave in some cases produced architectural effects and grouping of\npopulation not in harmony with existing neighborhoods.\n(d)\nHave not in some cases fitted building and site development to the\nnatural features of the environment.\n(3)\nThere are tracts of land in the Town which, subject to consideration on a case-\nby-case basis, are capable of use under alternative forms of residential\ndevelopment that avoid the above results and accomplish the objectives\nhereinafter specified.\nB.\nObjectives. A PRD shall consist of single-family detached dwellings or attached\ndwellings, garden apartments or townhouses or a combination thereof which achieve\nboth of the following primary objectives:\n(1)\nPreservation of open space, such as open space resources and/or conservation\nresource areas, as set forth in Program Nos. 1 and 5 of the Plan of Conservation\nand Development for the Town of Guilford, Connecticut, and which is either:\n(a)\nSignificantly beneficial to the community by preserving unusual open\nspace features within the PRD or constituting part of an open space and\nconservation resource system covering a larger area; or\n(b)\nA significant portion of and enhancement to the design of the PRD by\nachieving a contrast between building and nonbuilding areas and\nsupporting the character of the neighborhood and the community.\n(2)\nArchitecture and site development of design merit, contributing to the\nappearance and beauty of the Town and achieving convenience of residential\nliving and economies in the use of energy and in all cases shall also:\n(a)\nBe located on a tract of land having the capability of supporting such\nalternative form of development;\n(b)\nHave a harmonious relationship to adjacent neighborhoods, such as,\nwith regard to but not limited to, the location and bulk of buildings,\nmaintenance of privacy and traffic access; and\n(c)\nConstitute a form of residential development which achieves both of the\nabove objectives in a manner more effective than a subdivision of\nindividual building lots permitted on the tract.\nC.\nAdditional objectives. PRD's may also, and are encouraged to, achieve positive\npreservation of farmland in active use and other managed open space and lower-cost\ndwelling units, and, in support thereof, PRD's which achieve these objectives may\ncontain additional dwelling units, as long as the primary objectives are also achieved.\nD.\nArea requirements. The following land area and dwelling unit density requirements are\napplicable to any Planned Residential Development (PRD):\n(1)\nTract. The tract or lot containing a PRD shall have at least the following minimum\narea of contiguous, predominantly undeveloped land; provided, however, that\na special permit for a PRD on a tract of lesser area may, at the discretion of the\nCommission, be approved when the PRD contains an open space reservation\nwhich adjoins and supports a permanent open space reservation on another lot.\n\nNEW PAGE 74\n273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(2)\nDwelling units. The maximum number of dwelling units in a PRD is determined\nbased in part upon a computation of the number of bedrooms (see $273-2.C. for\nthe definition of \"bedroom\") in relation to land area and land constraints within the\nPRD as follows:\n(a)\nFirst, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is determined by\nsubtracting the area of the following land constraints from the total PRD\nland area:\n[1]\nThe area of existing wetlands (see $273-2. for the definition of\n\"wetlands\");\n[2]\nThe area of existing watercourses (see $273-2. for the definition\nof \"watercourses\") having, at seasonal high flow or\nimpoundment, an area of 1/2 acre or more; and\n[3]\nThe significant area of steep slopes (greater than 25%).\n(b)\nIn Zones R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7, the net square-foot land\narea of the PRD is divided by the following factor designated for each\ndistrict and multiplied by 3.75 bedrooms:\n(c)\nIn Zone R-8, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is divided by a\nfactor of 80,000 and multiplied by 2.75 bedrooms.\n(d)\nWithin this maximum bedroom count, the number of bedrooms in each\ndwelling unit may be varied, provided that the total number of bedrooms\ndoes not exceed such count. In no PRD, however, shall there be less\nthan 9,000 square feet of net square-foot land area for each dwelling\nunit. When the PRD tract includes land in two or more zone districts in\nzones R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7 the total number of\nbedrooms will be calculated as above for each area in a separate district\nand added to determine the total allowed.
